1 The appellant manufactures home appliances such as mix er grinders, wet 
grinders and gas stoves. According to the appellant, based on a regular trade 
practice, it allows discounts to its distributors. These discounts may take the form 
of a scheme discount or, as the case may be , a quantity discount. The appellan t 
claims the discount as a deduction from the total turnover while arriving at the 
taxable turnover under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act 2003  (‘the Act ’).  2 
 
2 On 29 May 2010, the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes , 
Bengaluru  disallowed the quantity discount accorded by the appellant to its 
distributors on the ground that the discount was not relatable to the sales effected 
by the relevant tax invoices . The assessing authority held that the quantity  discount 
offered by the appellant could not be allow ed under Rule 3(2)(c) of the Karnataka 
Value Added Tax Rules 2005 ( ‘the Rules ’). The period in question was 1 April 2006 
to 31 March 2007, 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008  and 1 April 2008 to 31 March 
2009.  
 
3 On appeal, the Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes ( Appeals – 1), 
Bengaluru  set aside the order of the assessing  authority , holding that the quarterly 
scheme discount given by the appellant was a n allowable deduction since the 
appellant had realized the consideration from the purchaser towards the sa le of 
goods after deducting the amount of discount and, VAT was charged only on the 
net amount shown in the tax invoice after allowing the benefit of discount.  
 
4 The order of the first appellate authority dated 12 October 2010 was revised 
under Section 6 4 (1) of the Act by the Additional Commissioner on the ground that 
the quarterly discount given by the appellant was in respect of the performance of 
the previous quarter and not in respect of the sales  offered under the same 
invoice s.  3 
 
5 The appellant instituted Sales Tax Appeals before the High Court of 
Karnataka. By a judgment dated 19 March 2014, a Division Bench of the Karnataka 
High Court dismissed the appeals.  
 
6 The case of the appellant is that it offers a quantity  discount to its  distributors 
depending on their performance during the previous quarter. This is part of a 
marketing /sales strategy under which the appellant allows a certain percentage as 
a quarterly discount to its dealers on the basis of the sales turnover generated b y 
a dealer in every quarter of the financial year. The discount is given by the 
appellant to its dealers in the sales invoices raised in the subsequent quarter. The 
amount of the discount is deducted from the gross sale price and VAT is collected 
and remit ted on the net sale price. According to the appellant, the  discount is 
offered in the regular course of business and the amount which it receive s towards 
sales consideration is only the net amount exclusive of discount, on which VAT is 
collected. Sales tax is leviable on the sale consideration  received/receivable . 
Section 2 (36) defines the expression ‘turnover ’ as the aggregate amount for which 
the goods are sold and the term ‘aggregate ’ means the net amount for which the 
goods are sold. The appellant claims that allowing a discount on the basis of the 
quarterly performance of its dealers is only a measure adopted by it for the 
computation of the d iscount. However,  the discount is given in a sale s bill and VAT 
is collected on the net sale consideration after the deduction of the discount. The 
High Court, it has been submitted, erred in rejecting the case of the appellant on 4 
 
the ground that the disco unt is given in respect of the performance of the previous 
quarter and not in respect of the sales transaction for which the invoice is raised. 
The High Court, it has been submitted , has failed to notice that Section 2(36) 
mandates that turnover be compute d as the aggregate amount for which goods 
are sold. It has been urged that deductions on account of trade discounts are given 
under agreement ; or under terms of sale or by established practice and should not 
be disallowed  only because they are not payable at the time of each invoice or 
deducted , from the invoice price ( Union of India  v Bombay Tyre International 
Ltd1). Moreover, periodical discounts such as half yearly discounts cannot , by their 
very nature , be shown on the  face of each invoice as the discount is known only 
at the end of the relevant period. Since the discount is known and understood at 
the time of the removal of goods, though quantif ied later, it was held to be eligible 
for deduction as held in Government  of India  v Madras Rubber Factory Ltd2. In 
sum and substance , the case of the appellant is that the sale price received by it 
is the net amount exclusive o f discount. It is understood at the time of the sale itself 
that the customer would be entitled to a discount, the quantum being computed at 
the end of the quarter. Hence, the real sale price charged by the appellant for 
parting with the goods is the net amount exclusive of discount and hence the trade 
discount given by the appellant cannot form a part of  the sales turnover. Finally, it 
                                                           
1 (2005 ) 3 SCC 787 
2 (1995) 4 SCC 349  5 
 
has been urged that a literal cons truction of Rule 3 (2)(c) would render it 
unworkable and practically impossible to implement.  
 
7 On the other hand, it has been urged on behalf of the respondents that under 
Rule 3 (2)(c) an amount which has been allowed as discount is permissible as a 
deduction in computing the taxable turnover only if the tax invoice issued in respect 
of the sales r elating to such discount shows the amount allowed as discount. The 
taxable event is the sale and the sale price has to be determined on the basis of 
the tax invoice or sale s bill issue d at the time of sale from the seller to the 
purchaser. The sale price c annot be altered or modified subsequent to the date of 
issuance of the tax invoice or sale s bill. Accordin g to the respondents, Rule 3 (2)(c) 
makes it mandatory that only a discount reflected in the sale s invoice is eligible for 
deduction. Admittedly , the discounts shown in the invoices of the appellant were 
not for sale but for the performance of the previous period of three to six months 
before the date of the invoice. In the submission of the respondents, a harmonious 
reading of Section 3, the charging section, along with the definition of ‘taxable 
turnover ’ in Section 2(34), ‘total turnover ’ in Section 2(35) and ‘turnover ’ in Section 
2 (36 ) read  with Rule 3(2)(c) would show that a performance -based  discount, 
issued at a much later date after assessing the performance of the dealer for a 
given period would not fall within the purview of eligible discount. In order to  arrive 
at the taxable turnover under Rule 3(2)(c), the discount has to be shown in respect 
of the sales in the tax invoice or the bill of sale.                    6 
 
8 Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy of tax.  It provides that the tax shall 
be levied on every sale of goods in the State by a registered dealer or a dealer 
liable to be registered in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  Every such 
dealer is under Section 4 liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover.  The expression 
‘turnover’ is defined in Section 2(36) thus:  
“2(36). ‘Turnover’ means the aggregate amount for which goods 
are sold or distributed or delivered or otherwise disposed of in any 
of the ways referred to in clause (29) by a dealer, either directly or 
through another, on his own account or on account of others, 
whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable 
consideration, and includes the aggregate amount for which 
goods are purchased from a person not registered under the Act 
and the value of goods transferred  or despatched outside the 
State otherwise than by way of sale, and subject to such 
conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed the amount for 
which goods are sold shall include any sums charged for anything 
done by the dealer in respect of the goods sold at the time of or 
before the delivery thereof.  
Explanation : The value of the goods transferred or despatched 
outside the State otherwise than by way of sale, shall be the 
amount for which the goods are ordinarily sold by the dealer or the 
prevailing market price of such goods where the dealer does not 
ordinarily sell the goods. ” 
 
The expression ‘taxable turnover’ is defined in Section 2(34) as follows:  
“2(34) ‘Taxable turnover’ means the turnover on which a dealer 
shall be liable to pay tax as determi ned after making such 
deductions from his total turnover and in such manner as may be 
prescribed, but shall not include the turnover of purchase or sale 
in the course of interstate trade or commerce or in the course of 
export of the goods out of the territ ory of India or in the course of 
import of the goods into the territory of India and the value of 
goods transferred or despatched outside the State otherwise than 
by way of sale. ” 
 7 
 
The above definitions indicate that turnover is defined to mean the aggregate 
amount for which go ods are sold , distributed , delivered or otherwise disposed of. 
The taxable turnover is computed after making such deductions from the total 
turnover and in such manner as may be prescribed (‘total turnover’ is defined by 
Sectio n 2(35) to mean the aggregate turnover in all goods of a dealer at all places 
of business in the State s). In arriving at the taxable turnover, the statute 
contemplates deductions , as prescribed , are to be made from the total turnover.  
The liability to pay tax is on the taxable turnover. Taxable turnover is the net 
amount that remains upon making deductions as prescribed from the turnover.  
 
9 Rule 3 of the Rules provide for the determination of turnover.  Clause ( 1) of 
Rule 3 provide fo r the determination of the total turnover of a dealer. Clause (2) 
provide for the determination of the taxable turnover. Taxable turnover is arrived 
at by making the deductions which are stipulated in clause (2) from the total 
turnover.  Rule 3(2)(c) provi des as follows:  
“(2) The taxable turnover shall be determined by allowing the 
following deductions from the total turnover: - 
(c) All amounts allowed as discount:’  
PROVIDED that such discount is allowed in accordance with the 
regular practice of the dealer or is in accordance with the terms of 
any contract or agreement entered into in a particular case 3[and 
the tax invoice or bill of sale issued in respect of the sales relating 
to such discount shows the amount allowed as discount: .”

10 In Southern Motors  v State of Karnataka4, a Bench of two learned judges 
of this Court considered the provisions of Rule 3(2)(c)  of the  Rules.  In that case, 
the appellant who was a registered dealer with a business in motor vehicles issued 
tax invoices to its purchasers.  After the sales were completed, credit notes were 
issued to  the customers granting them discounts . As a result , the appellant 
retained only the net amount of the invoice less the discount reflect ed in the credit 
notes. During the course o f the assessment , the appellant was subjected to orders 
of rectification , disallowing the deduction of post -sale discounts.  This Court held 
thus:  
“28. It is a matter of common experience that in the present 
contemporary competitive market, trade discounts not only are 
dependent on variable factors but also might be strategically not 
disclosable at the time of the original sale/purchase so as to be 
coeva lly reflected in the tax invoice or the bill of sale, as the case 
may be. The actual quantification of the trade discount, depending 
on the nature of the trade and the related stipulations in any 
contract with regard thereto, may be deferred till the happe ning of 
a contemplated event, so much so that the benefit thereof is 
extended at a point of time subsequent to that of the original 
sale/purchase. That by itself, subject to proof of such regular trade 
practice and the contract/agreement entered into betwe en the 
parties, would not render the trade discount otherwise legal and 
acceptable, either non est or fictitious for evading tax liability. In 
the above factual premise, the interpretation as sought to be 
provided by the Revenue would evidently reduce Sect ion 
3(2)( c) to a dead letter, ineffective and unworkable and would 
defeat the objective of permitting deductions from the total 
turnover on account of trade discount .” (Id at page 485)  
                                                                       (emphasis supplied)  
 
 
                                                           
4 (2017) 3 SCC 467  9 
 
Relying on the earlier decisions of this Court, it was held that a trade discount ought 
not to be disallowed merely on the ground that it is not payable at the time of each 
invoice or deducted from the invoice price.  In the of view of this Court :  
“29…Perceptionally, if taxable turnover is to be compri sed of 
sale/purchase price, it is beyond one's comprehension as to why 
the trade discount should be disallowed, subject to the proof 
thereof, only because it was effectuated subsequent to the original 
sale but evidenced by contemporaneous documents and ref lected 
in the relevant accounts.”  (Id at page 485)  
 
 
The Legislature, the Court held , would not be unaware of the prevalent practice of 
offering trade discounts in commercial dispensations.  In the view of the Court:  
“38…To insist on the quantification of trade discount for deduction 
at the time of sale itself, by incorporating the same in the tax 
invoice/bill of sale, would be to demand the impossible for all 
practical purposes and thus would be illogical, irrational and 
absurd.” (Id at page 492)  
 
This Court accordingly read down the first proviso to Rule 3(2)(c)  in the following 
manner:  
“40. On an overall review of the scheme of the Act and the Rules 
and the underlying objectives, in particular of Sections 29 and 30 
of the Act and Rule 3 of the Rul es, we are of the considered 
opinion that the requirement of reference of the discount in the tax 
invoice or bill of sale to qualify it for deduction has to be construed 
in relation to the transaction resulting in the final sale/purchase 
price and not limi ted to the original sale sans the trade discount. 
However, the transactions allowing discount have to be proved on 
the basis of contemporaneous records and the final sale price 
after deducting the trade discount must mandatorily be reflected 
in the account s as stipulated under Rule 3(2)( c) of the Rules. The 
sale/purchase price has to be adjudged on a combined 
consideration of the tax invoice or bill of sale, as the case may be, 
along with the accounts reflecting the trade discount and the 10 
 
actual price paid.  The first proviso has thus to be so read down, 
as above, to be in consonance with the true intendment of the 
legislature and to achieve as well the avowed objective of correct 
determination of the taxable turnover. The contrary interpretation 
accorded by the High Court being in defiance of logic and the 
established axioms of interpretation of statutes is thus 
unacceptable and is negated. ”  (Id at page 493)  
 
11 This view was rendered by a bench of two learned Judges, including one of 
us (the learned Chief Justice) .  Having regard to the construction which has been 
placed on the provisions of Rule 3(2)(c) of the Rules in Southern Motors  (supra), 
the judgment of the High Court in the present case is accordingly unsustainable.  
 
12 The liability to pay tax is on the taxable turnover. Taxable turnover is arrived 
at after making permissible deductions from the total turnover. Among them are 
“all amounts allowed as discounts.” Such a discount must, however, be in accord 
with the regular trade practice of the deale r or the contract or agreement entered 
into in a particular case. The expression “the tax invoice or bill of sale issued  in 
respect of the sales relating to such discount shows the amount allowed as such 
discount” is not happily wo rded. The words “in respe ct of the sales relating to such 
discount” cannot be construed to mean that the discount would be inadmissible as 
a deduction unless the tax invoice pertaining to the goods originally issued shows 
the discount. This is a matter of ascertainment. The assess ee must establish from 
its accounts that the discount relates specifically to the sales with reference to 
which it is allowed. In the first part of the proviso, Rule 3(2)(c) recognizes trade 11 
 
practice or, as the case may be, the contact or agreement of the dealer. The latter 
part which provides a methodology for ascertainment does not override the earlier 
part. Both must be construed together. Above all, it must be remember ed that 
taxable turnover is turnover net of deductions. All trade discounts are allowa ble as 
permissible deductions.  
 
13  We accordingly allow the appeal s and set aside the judgment of  the High 
Court.  We direct  that in computing the taxable turnover for the relevant years, the 
appellant would be entitled to a deduction of the trade discoun t, following the 
parameters laid down in paragraph 40 of the judgment in Southern Motors  (supra) 
and as explained above.  There shall be no order as to costs.

RANJAN GOGOI, CJI
1.“Whether a woman forced to leave her matrimonial home on account of
acts and conduct that constitute cruelty can initiate and access the legal process
within the jurisdiction of the courts where she is forced to take shelter with the
parents or other family members”.  This is the precise question that arises for
determination in this group of appeals.  2
2.The opinions of this Court on the aforesaid question being sharply divided,
the present reference to a larger Bench has been made for consideration of the
question indicated hereinabove.  
3.In
(i)Y.  Abraham  Ajith  and  Others  v.  Inspector  of  Police,
Chennai and Another (2004) 8 SCC 100.
(ii)Ramesh and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu (2005) 3 SCC 
507.
(iii) Manish Ratan and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh
and Another (2007) 1 SCC 262.
(iv)Amarendu Jyoti and Others v. State of Chhattisgarh and 
Others (2014) 12 SCC 362.
a view has been taken that if on account of cruelty committed to a wife in a
matrimonial home she takes shelter in the parental home and if no specific act of
commission of cruelty in the parental home can be attributed to the husband or
his relatives, the initiation of proceedings under Section 498A in the courts having
jurisdiction  in  the  area  where  the  parental  home  is  situated  will  not  be
permissible.  The core fact that would be required to be noted in the above cases
is that there were no allegations made on behalf of the aggrieved wife that any
overt act of cruelty or harassment had been caused to her at the parental home
after she had left the matrimonial home.  It is in these circumstances that the view
had been expressed in the above cases that the offence of cruelty having been
committed in the matrimonial home the same does not amount to a continuing
offence committed in the parental home to which place the aggrieved wife may
have later shifted.
4.In  Sujata Mukherjee v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee (1997) 5 SCC 30;
Sunita Kumari Kashyap v. State of Bihar and Another (2011) 11 SCC 301  and3
State of M.P.  v. Suresh  Kaushal  & Anr.  (2003)  11 SCC 126  a  seemingly
different view has been taken.  However, the said view may appear to be based
in the particular facts of each of the cases in question.  For instance, in Sujata
Mukherjee  (Supra)  there  was  a  specific  allegation  that  the  husband,  after
committing acts of cruelty in the matrimonial home, had also gone to the parental
house of the wife where she had taken shelter and had assaulted her there.  On
the said facts this court in Sujata Mukherjee (Supra) held that the offence is a
continuing  offence  under  Section  178  (c)  of  the  Cr.P.C.   In  Sunita  Kumari
Kashyap (Supra), there was an allegation that the wife was illtreated by her
husband who left her at her parental home and further that the husband had not
made any enquiries about her thereafter.  There was a further allegation that
even when the wife had tried to contact the husband, he had not responded.  In
the said facts, this court took the view that the consequences of the offence
under Section 498A have occurred at the parental home and, therefore, the court
at that place would have jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence alleged in
view of Section 179 of the Cr.P.C.  Similarly in State of M.P. vs. Suresh Kaushal
(Supra) as the miscarriage was caused to the wife at Jabalpur, her parental
home, on account of cruelty meted out to her in the matrimonial home, it was held
that the court at the place of the parental home of the wife would have jurisdiction
to entertain the complaint under Section 179 Cr.P.C.
5.The above two views which the learned referring bench had considered
while making the present reference, as already noticed, were founded on the
peculiar facts of the two sets of cases before the Court.  It may be possible to
sustain both the views in the light of the facts of the cases in which such view
was rendered by this court.  What confronts the court in the present case is4
however different.  Whether in a case where cruelty had been committed in a
matrimonial home by the husband or the relatives of the husband and the wife
leaves the matrimonial home and takes shelter in the parental home located at a
different place, would the courts situated at the place of the parental home of the
wife have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint under Section 498A.  This is in a
situation where no overt act of cruelty or harassment is alleged to have been
committed by the husband at the parental home where the wife had taken shelter.
6.A look at the provisions of Chapter XIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (Cr.P.C) dealing with the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court in inquires and
trials will now be required.  Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
contemplates that “every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a
Court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed”.  It is, therefore, clear that
in the normal course, it is the court within whose local jurisdiction the offence is
committed that would have the power and authority to take cognizance of the
offence in question.  
7.Sections 178 and 179 are exceptions to the above rule and may be set out
hereinunder:
“178.Place of inquiry or trial .- 
(a)  When  it  is  uncertain  in  which  of  several  local  areas  an
offence was committed, or
(b) where an offence is committed partly in one local area and
partly in another, or
(c) where an offence is a continuing one, and continues to be
committed in more local areas than one, or
(d) where it consists of several acts done in different local areas,
it may be inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over
any of such local areas.”5
“179. Offence triable  where  act is  done  or consequence
ensues.- When an act is an offence by reason of anything which
has been done and of a consequence which has ensued, the
offence may be inquired into or tried by a Court within whose
local  jurisdiction  such  thing  has  been  done  or  such
consequence has ensued.”
8.Section  178  creates  an  exception  to  the  “ordinary  rule”  engrafted  in
Section 177 by permitting the courts in another local area where the offence is
partly committed to take cognizance.  Also if the offence committed in one local
area continues in another local area, the courts in the latter place would be
competent to take cognizance of the matter.  Under Section 179, if by reason of
the consequences emanating from a criminal act an offence is occasioned in
another jurisdiction, the court in that jurisdiction would also be competent to take
cognizance.  Thus, if an offence is committed partly in one place and partly in
another; or if the offence is a continuing offence or where the consequences of a
criminal act result in an offence being committed at another place, the exception
to the “ordinary rule” would be attracted and the courts within whose jurisdiction
the criminal act is committed will cease to have exclusive jurisdiction to try the
offence.
9.At this stage it may also be useful to take note of what can be understood
to a continuing offence.  The issue is no longer res integra having been answered
by this court in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi (1972) 2 SCC 890.   Para 5
may be usefully noticed in this regard.
“5.A  continuing  offence  is  one  which  is  susceptible  of
continuance  and  is  distinguishable  from  the  one  which  is
committed once and for all.  It is one of those offences which
arises out of a failure to obey or comply with a rule or its
requirement and which involves a penalty, the liability for which
continues  until  the  rule  or  its  requirement  is  obeyed  or6
complied with.  On every occasion that such disobedience or
non-compliance  occurs  and  reoccurs,  there  is  the  offence
committed. The distinction between the two kinds of offences
is between an act or omission which constitutes an offence
once and for all and an act or omission which continues, and
therefore, constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion on
which it continues.  In the case of a continuing  offence,
there is thus the ingredient of continuance of the offence which
is absent in the case of an offence which takes place when an
act or omission is committed once and for all.”
10.The question that has posed for an answer has nothing to do with the
provisions of Section 178 (b) or (c).  What has to be really determined is whether
the exception carved out by Section 179 would have any application to confer
jurisdiction in the courts situated in the local area where the parental house of the
wife is located.  
11.To answer the above question, one will have to look into the Statement of
Objects and Reasons of the Criminal Law [2nd Amendment Act, 1983 (Act 46 of
1983)] by which Section 498A was inserted in the Indian Penal Code.  The
section itself may be noticed in the first instance:
 “498A.Husband  or  relative  of  husband  of  a  woman
subjecting her to cruelty.— Whoever, being the husband or
the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman
to cruelty shall be pun ished with imprisonment for a term which
may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “cruelty” means
—
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to
drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or
danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the
woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a
view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any
unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on
account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet
such demand.”7
12.Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code was introduced by the Criminal Law
(second amendment) Act, 1983.  In addition to the aforesaid amendment in the Indian
Penal Code, the provisions of Sections 174 and 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973  relating  to  inquiries  by  police  in  case  of  death  by  suicides  and  inquiries  by
magistrates into cause of such deaths were also amended.   Section 198A was also
inserted in the Code of Criminal Procedure with regard to prosecution of offences under
Section 498A.  Further by an amendment in the first schedule to the Cr.PC  the offence
under  Section  498A  was  made  cognizable  and  non-bailable.   Of  considerable
significance is the introduction of Section 113A in the Indian Evidence Act by the Criminal
Law (second amendment) Act, 1983 providing for presumption as to abetment of suicide
by a married woman to be drawn if such suicide had been committed within a period of
seven  years  from  the  date  of  marriage  of  the  married  woman  and  she  had  been
subjected to cruelty.  Section 113A is in the following term: 
“113-A.  Presumption  as  to  abetment  of  suicide  by  a
married  woman.–  When  the  question  is  whether  the
commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her
husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that
she had committed suicide within a period of seven years
from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such
relative  of  her  husband  had subjected her  to cruelty,  the
Court  may  presume,  having  regard  to  all  the  other
circumstances  of  the  case,  that  such  suicide  had  been
abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.
Explanation.– For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  “cruelty”
shall have the same meaning as in section 498-A of the
Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).”
13.The object behind the aforesaid amendment, undoubtedly, was to combat the
increasing cases of cruelty by the husband and the relatives of the husband on the wife
which leads to commission of suicides or grave injury to the wife besides seeking to deal
with harassment of the wife so as to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any
unlawful demand for any property, etc.  The above stated object of the amendment
cannot be overlooked while answering the question arising in the present case.  The8
judicial  endeavour  must,  therefore,  always  be  to  make  the  provision  of  the  laws
introduced and inserted by the Criminal Laws (second amendment) Act, 1983 more
efficacious and effective in view of the clear purpose behind the introduction of the
provisions in question, as already noticed.
14. “Cruelty” which is the crux of the offence under Section 498A IPC is
defined in Black’s Law Dictionary to mean “The intentional and malicious infliction
of  mental  or  physical  suffering  on  a living  creature,  esp.  a human;  abusive
treatment; outrage (Abuse, inhuman treatment, indignity)”.  Cruelty can be both
physical or mental cruelty.  The impact on the mental health of the wife by overt
acts on the part of the husband or his relatives; the mental stress and trauma of
being driven away from the matrimonial home and her helplessness to go back to
the same home for fear of being illtreated are aspects that cannot be ignored
while understanding the meaning of the expression “cruelty” appearing in Section
498A of the Indian Penal Code.  The emotional distress or psychological effect on
the wife, if not the physical injury, is bound to continue to traumatize the wife even
after she leaves the matrimonial home and takes shelter at the parental home.
Even if the acts of physical  cruelty committed in the matrimonial house may have
ceased and such acts  do not occur at the parental home,  there can be no doubt
that the mental trauma and the psychological distress cause by the acts of the
husband including verbal exchanges, if any, that had compelled the wife to leave
the matrimonial home and take shelter with her parents would continue to persist
at the parental home. Mental cruelty borne out of physical cruelty or abusive and
humiliating verbal exchanges would continue in the parental home even though
there may not be any overt act of physical cruelty at such place.  9
15.The  Protection  of  Women  from  Domestic  Violence  Act,  as  the  object
behind its enactment would indicate, is to provide a civil remedy to victims of
domestic violence as against the remedy in criminal law which is what is provided
under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The definition of the Domestic
Violence  in  the  Protection  of  Women  from  Domestic  Violence  Act,  2005
contemplates harm or injuries that endanger the health, safety, life, limb or well-
being,  whether  mental  or  physical,  as  well  as  emotional  abuse.   The  said
definition would certainly, for reasons stated above, have a close connection with
Explanation A & B to Section 498A, Indian Penal Code which defines cruelty.  The
provisions contained in Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, undoubtedly,
encompasses both mental as well as the physical well-being of the wife.  Even
the silence of the wife may have an underlying element of an emotional distress
and mental agony.  Her sufferings at the parental home though may be directly
attributable to commission of acts of cruelty by the husband at the matrimonial
home would, undoubtedly, be the consequences of the acts committed at the
matrimonial  home.   Such  consequences,  by  itself,  would  amount  to  distinct
offences committed at the parental home where she has taken shelter.  The
adverse effects on the mental health in the parental home though on account of
the  acts  committed  in  the  matrimonial  home  would,  in  our  considered  view,
amount to commission of cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A at the
parental home. The consequences of the cruelty committed at the matrimonial
home results in repeated offences being committed at the parental home.  This is
the  kind  of  offences  contemplated  under  Section  179  Cr.P.C  which  would
squarely be applicable to the present case as an answer to the question raised. 10
16.We, therefore, hold that the courts at the place where the wife takes
shelter after leaving or driven away from the matrimonial home on account of acts
of cruelty committed by the husband or his relatives, would, dependent on the
factual  situation,  also  have  jurisdiction  to  entertain  a  complaint  alleging
commission of offences under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.
17.All the appeals are disposed of in terms of the above.

1)Leave granted.
2)The   present   appeal   has   been   filed   against   the   impugned
judgment and order dated 29.10.2012 passed by the High Court of
2Judicature at Madras in Tax Case (Appeal) No. 368 of 2005 wherein
the Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal filed by the
respondent by absolving the additional tax liability imposed by the
Assessing Officer, vide order dated 25.01.1996.
3)Brief facts:­
(a)The Respondent ­ an individual and the proprietor of M/s
Chandrakala and Company, is a stock broker registered with the
Madras Stock Exchange.  He is stated to be an approved broker of
the Indian Bank.  The assessment years under consideration herein
are 1991­92, 1992­93 and 1993­94 respectively. During all these
relevant assessment years the Respondent acted as a broker to the
Indian Bank in purchase of the securities from different financial
institutions.
(b)It is the case of the Revenue that the Indian Bank, in order to
save itself from being charged unusually high rate of interest on
borrowing money from the market, lured Public Sector Undertaking
(PSUs) to make fixed term deposit with it on higher rate of interest.
The   rate of interest offered to the   PSUs for making huge term
3deposits was to the extent of 12.75% of interest on fixed deposits
against the approved 8% rate of interest in accordance with the RBI
directions. 
(c)In order to pay higher interest to the PSUs who made a fixed
term   deposit   with   the   Indian   Bank,   the   bank   requested   the
Respondent to purchase securities on its behalf at a prescribed
price which was unusually high but adequate to cover the market
price of the securities, brokerage/incidental charges to be levied by
the Respondent on these transactions, apart from covering the extra
interest payable to the PSUs. The Respondent, on the instructions
of Indian Bank, purchased securities at a particular rate quoted by
the Bank and sold them to Indian Railways Finance Corporation.
Bank of Madura was the routing bank through which the securities
were purchased and sold to Indian Bank for which Bank of Madura
charged service charges.  The Respondent was paid commission in
respect   of   transactions   done   on   behalf   of   Indian   Bank.   Under
instructions from Indian Bank, a portion of the amount realized
from the security transactions carried on behalf of Indian Bank was
paid   by   way   of   additional   interest   to   certain   Public   Sector
4Undertakings (PSU) on the deposits made with the Indian Bank and
out of eight PSUs three has confirmed the receipt of such additional
interest through demand drafts.  
(d)The Respondent filed his return of income for the Assessment
Year   1991­92   on   01.11.1993   and   declared   his   income   at   Rs.
4,82,83,620/­. The total income was determined at 4,85,46,120/­
vide order dated 30.06.1994. However, later on, the case was taken
up for scrutiny and assessment was framed under Sec 143(3) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short ‘the Act’). The Assessing Officer, vide
order   dated   25.01.1996,   raised   a   demand   for   a   sum   of   Rs.
14,73,91,000/­ with regard to the sum payable to the PSUs while
holding  that   the  Respondent  has  not  acted  as  a  broker  in  the
transactions   carried   out   for   the   Indian   Bank   rather   as   an
independent dealer and that there was no overriding title in favour
of the PSU’s with regard to the additional amount earned out of the
securities transactions and it is a case of application of income after
accrual and, hence, the said amount is liable to be assessed as the
income of the Respondent. 
5(e)The Respondent, being dissatisfied with the order, preferred
an   Appeal   before   the   Commissioner   for   Income   Tax   (Appeals).
Learned  Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), vide order dated
08.08.1996, set aside the demand for additional tax while deciding
the issue in favour of the Respondent and held that the alleged
additional interest payable to the PSUs could not be considered as
the income of the Respondent. 
(f)Being aggrieved by the order dated 08.08.1996, the Revenue
filed   an   appeal   bearing   No.   ITA   No.2297(Mds)/1996   before   the
Income   Tax   Appellate   Tribunal   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   ‘the
Tribunal’). The Tribunal, vide order dated 05.01.2005, allowed the
appeal filed by the Revenue and held that the amount received at
the hands of the Respondent which is alleged to be payable to the
PSUs is the income of the Respondent and there is no overriding
title exists in favour of the PSUs so as to cause diversion of income. 
(g)It   is   pertinent   to   note   that   in   the   meanwhile   criminal
proceedings   which   were   initiated   with   respect   to   the   present
transactions in question against the Respondent along with others
bearing No. CC 17 of 1997, was decided on 27.04.2004 by the CBI
6court. The court, while acquitting the Respondent has observed that
the relationship between the Indian Bank and the Respondent is
that   of   principal­agent   and   with   regard   to   the   transactions   in
question the Respondent acted in the capacity of a broker and not
as an individual dealer. However, the Tribunal refused to rely on the
evidence   produced   in   the   trial   court   on   the   ground   that   the
assessment proceedings are different from the criminal proceedings
and the evidence adduced in the trial court couldn’t be relied to
absolve the Respondent from the tax liability. 
(h)Being aggrieved by the order of the ITAT dated 05.01.2005, the
assessee filed Tax Case Appeal No. 368 of 2005 before the High
Court. The High Court, vide order dated 29.10.2012, set aside the
order of the Tribunal while relying on the evidence given in the
criminal case in this regard. Hence, this appeal is filed before this
Court.
7Point(s) for consideration:­
4)The only point for consideration before this Court is whether
on the facts and circumstances of the present case the High Court
was right in holding that the alleged additional interest payable to
PSUs cannot be assessed as income of the Respondent?
Rival contentions:­
5)Learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   Revenue
contended that the High Court erred in relying on the evidence
given in the criminal proceedings as the nature of the criminal
proceedings   is   different   from   that   of   assessment   proceedings.
Learned   counsel   further   contended   that   the   High   Court,   while
passing impugned judgment, relied on the letter dated 25.03.1994
of M/s Indian Bank.  However, the High Court failed to consider the
factual position that out of 8 PSUs     only 3 have confirmed the
receipt of demand drafts.   The remaining 5 PSUs denied to have
received any such Demand Draft either from Shri T. Jayachandran,
the Respondent or from M/s Indian Bank and the High Court was
not justified in accepting the Respondent’s contention that there
8was   some   overriding   title   in   favour   of   the   PSUs   in   the   alleged
additional interest payable to them by the Indian Bank. 
6)Learned counsel for the Revenue finally contended that the
impugned judgment is bad in law on the facts and circumstances of
the present case and requires to be set aside by this Court. 
7)Per   contra,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the
Respondent submitted that the role of the Respondent was only
that of a conduit for taking demand drafts in respect of additional
interests payable to the PSUs and the demand draft taken on behalf
of the Indian Bank did not form part of the total income of the
Respondent and there exists an overriding title in favour of the
PSUs with reference to the amount in question i.e., the additional
interest payable to the PSUs. 
8)Learned   senior   counsel   further   submitted   that   though   the
assessment proceedings are different in nature from that of criminal
proceedings but the same could not be a ground to throw out the
legitimate conclusion arrived at by the trial court on the basis of
proved evidence. Learned senior counsel finally submitted that the
9High Court was right in taking note of the developments in the
criminal case in coming to the conclusion that the respondent was
acting as a broker or agent to the Indian Bank and the order of the
High Court was well within the parameters of law and requires no
interference.
9)We   have   heard   learned   counsel   for   both   the   parties   and
perused the factual matrix of the case.
Discussion:­
10)The answer to the short question whether the alleged interest
payable   to   the   PSUs   can   be   assessed   as   an   income   of   the
Respondent   depends   on   the   determination   of   true   nature   of
relationship between the Indian Bank and the Respondent with
regard to the transactions in question and the capacity in which he
held the amount of 14,73,91,000/­. Now, coming to the question of
relationship  between   the  Indian   Bank   and  the   Respondent,   the
normal settlement process in Government securities is that during
transaction   banks   make   payments   and   deliver   the   securities
directly to each other.   The broker’s only function is to bring the
10buyer and seller together and help them to negotiate the terms for
which he earns a commission from both the parties.  He does not
handle   either   cash   or   securities.     In   this   respect,   the   broker
functions like the broker in the inter bank foreign exchange market.
The   conduct   of   the   Respondent   in   the   transaction   in   question
cannot   be   termed   to   be   strictly   within   the   normal   course   of
business and the irregularities can be noticed from the manner in
which the whole transactions were conducted. However, the same
cannot   be   basis   for   holding   the   Respondent   liable   for   tax   with
regard to the sum in question and what is required to be seen is
whether there accrued any real income to the Respondent or not.
11)It is required to be seen in what capacity the Respondent held
the said amount­independently or on behalf of the Indian Bank.
The Assessing Officer, while passing order dated 25.01.1996, has
held that there exists no agreement between the Respondent and
the Indian Bank about the payment of additional interest to the
PSUs and there was no overriding title in respect of the additional
interest for the PSUs. However, the position in this regard is very
much settled that an agreement need not be in writing but can be
11oral also and the same can be inferred from the conduct of the
parties. 
12)Further, while considering the claim of the Respondent and
the view of the Assessing Officer, how the bank itself had treated
the Respondent, is a matter of relevance.  At   the   outset,   learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue contended that the
proceedings under the Income Tax Act are independent proceedings
and   the   High   Court  committed  a   grave  error  in   relying  on   the
findings of the criminal Court. We do not find any force in the
contention of the appellant herein as the High Court has not held
that the findings of the criminal court are binding on the Revenue
authorities. Rather the High Court was of the view that the findings
arrived at by the criminal court can be taken into consideration
while   deciding   the   question   as   to   the   relationship   between   the
parties to the case. When the findings are arrived by a criminal
court on the evidence and the material placed on record then in
absence of anything shown to the contrary, there seems to be no
reason as to why these duly proved evidence should not be relied
upon by the Court. The High Court has specifically appraised the
12findings given by the CBI Court in this regard. The relationship
between the Indian Bank and the Respondent is very much clear by
the evidence led during the criminal proceedings. The Executive
Director of the Bank has specifically spoken about the role of the
Respondent as a broker specifically engaged by the Bank for the
purchase of securities and that the Bank has included the interest
money too in the consideration paid, for the purpose of taking
demand drafts in favour of PSUs. Further, the evidence led by other
bank officials points out that the price of securities itself were fixed
by the bank authorities and as per their directions the Respondent
had   purchased   the   securities   at   the   market   price   and   the
differential   amount  was   directed  to   be  used  for  taking   demand
drafts from the bank itself for paying additional interest to the
PSUs. Further, the letter dated 25.03.1994 by the Bank wherein the
Bank had acknowledged the receipt of Demand Drafts taken by the
Respondent gives an unblurred picture about the capacity of the
Respondent in holding the amount in question. Consequently, the
conduct of the parties, as is recorded in the criminal proceedings
showing the receipt of amount by the broker, the purpose of receipt
13and the demand drafts taken by the broker at the instance of the
bank are sufficient to prove the fact that the Respondent acted as a
broker to the Bank and, hence, the additional interest payable to
the PSUs could not be held to be his property or income.
13)The income that has actually accrued to the Respondent is
taxable. What income has really occurred to be decided, not by
reference to physical receipt of income, but by the receipt of income
in reality. Given the fact that the Respondent had acted only as a
broker   and   could   not   claim   any   ownership   on   the   sum   of   Rs.
14,73,91,000/­ and that the receipt of money was only for the
purpose of taking demand drafts for the payment of the differential
interest   payable   by   Indian   Bank   and   that   the   Respondent   had
actually handed over the said money to the Bank itself, we have no
hesitation in holding that the Respondent held the said amount in
trust to be paid to the public sector units on behalf of the Indian
Bank based on prior understanding reached with the bank at the
time   of   sale   of   securities   and,   hence,   the   said   sum   of   Rs.
14,73,91,000/­ cannot be termed as the income of the Respondent.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL  APPEAL No. 1463 OF 2019

J U D G M E N T
Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.  
1.Leave granted.
12
2.This appeal is filed against the final judgment
and   order   dated   19.02.2018  passed   by   the   High
Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Writ Petition
No.34313   of   2017   whereby   the   High   Court
dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant
herein.  
3.In order to appreciate the short controversy
involved in this appeal, it is necessary to set out a
few relevant facts.
4.The   appellant­Mysore   Development
Authority(in short, “the Authority”) is the defendant
whereas the respondent is the plaintiff in the suit
out of which this appeal arises.
5.The   respondent   filed   a   civil   suit   (O.S.
No.685/2006) against the appellant­Authority in the
Court   of   Principal   Senior   Civil   Judge   and   Small
Causes Court, Mysuru. The suit was for declaration
of title and permanent injunction in relation to the
23
land bearing No. 2442 situated in Vijaynagara, 2nd
stage,     Devaraja   Mohalla,     Mysuru   (hereinafter
referred to as ‘suit land’).
6.The appellant­Authority, on being served filed
their written statement. The parties adduced their
evidence.   By   judgment/decree   dated   20.03.2012,
the Trial Court decreed the respondent's suit and
passed a decree against the appellant­Authority in
relation to the suit land.
7.The appellant­Authority felt aggrieved and filed
first appeal (R.A.No.370/2012) under Section 96 of
the   Code   of   Civil   Procedure,   1908   (hereinafter
referred to as “the Code”) in the Court of Principal
District and Sessions Judge,  Mysuru. This appeal
was listed for hearing on 25.04.2014. On that day,
the appellant's counsel did not appear when the
appeal was called on for hearing and, therefore, the
Appellate Court dismissed the appeal in default.
34
8.  The   appellant­Authority,   therefore,   filed   an
application before the Appellate Court praying for
recall  of  the  order  dated  25.04.2014  and  sought
restoration of their appeal for its hearing on the
merits. By order dated 29.06.2016, the Appellate
Court dismissed the application, which gave rise to
filing of the writ petition by the appellant­Authority
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India before
the   High   Court   of   Karnataka   at   Bengaluru.   By
impugned order, the High Court dismissed the writ
petition   and   affirmed   the   order   of   the   Appellate
Court, which has given rise to filing of this appeal
by way of special leave by the defendant in this
Court.
9.    So,   the   short   question,   which   arises   for
consideration   in   this   appeal,   is   whether   the
Appellate Court and the High Court were justified in
dismissing   the   application   (M.A.No.77/2014)   filed
45
by   the   appellant­Authority(defendant)   and   were,
therefore, justified in refusing to restore their first
appeal.
10.  Heard Mr. Mahesh Thakur, learned counsel
for the appellant­Authority and Mr. Anand Sanjay
M. Nuli, learned counsel for the respondent.
11.Having   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are   inclined   to   allow   the   appeal,   set   aside   the
impugned   order   and   also   the   order   dated
29.06.2016   passed   by   the   Principal   District   and
Sessions   Judge   in   M.A.   No.77   of   2014   and,   in
consequence,   allow   the   application   filed   by   the
appellant­Authority(defendant) and recall the order
dated 25.04.2014 passed by the Appellate Court.
56
 
12.At the outset we consider it apposite to clarify
one legal position, which was rightly brought to our
notice   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant­
Authority.
13.The first appeal (R.A. No.370/2012) filed by
the appellant­Authority suffered dismissal in default
on 25.04.2014 because on that day none appeared
for them when the appeal was called on for hearing.
14.  Such   dismissal   attracted   the   provisions   of
Order 41 Rule 19 of the Code and, therefore, the
appeal   could   be   re­admitted   for   hearing   at   the
instance of the appellant­Authority only by taking
recourse to the provisions of Order 41 Rule 19 and
subject to their making out a sufficient cause which
prevented   them   from   appearing   on   25.04.2014
when the appeal was called on for hearing.
67
15.An   order   of   refusal   to   re­admit   the   appeal
passed by the Appellate Court under Order 41 Rule
19 of the Code is made expressly appealable under
Order 43 Rule 1(t) of the Code to the High Court. In
this case, since the Appellate Court refused to re­
admit the appeal and dismissed the application filed
by   the   appellant­Authority,   the   remedy   of   the
appellant­Authority was to file an appeal in the High
Court   against   the   order   dated   29.06.2016   under
Order 43 Rule 1 (t) of the Code. 
16.The   appellant­Authority   instead   of   filing   the
appeal under Order 43 Rule 1(t) of the Code filed
the   writ   petition   under   Article   227   of   the
Constitution against the order dated 29.06.2016. It
was an error on the part of the appellant­Authority
and   the   High   Court   should   have   declined   to
entertain   the   writ   petition   and   instead   either
78
converted the writ petition into the appeal under
Order 43 Rule 1(t) of the Code or permitted the
appellant­Authority   to   withdraw   the   writ   petition
with a liberty to file an appeal under Order 43 Rule
1(t)   of   the   Code,   as   the   case   may   be,   in   its
discretion.   It   was,   however,   not   noticed   and   the
High Court dismissed the writ petition on merits.
17.  We, therefore, clarify the legal position that
the appeal lies under Order 43 Rule 1(t) of the Code
to   the   High   Court   against   the   order   dated
29.06.2016 passed by the Appellate Court which
dismissed   the   application   made   under   Order   41
Rule 19 of the Code.
18.Be that as it may, in our considered opinion,
the High Court erred in dismissing the writ petition.
The   High   Court   should   have   allowed   the   writ
petition   and   the   appellant­Authority   should   have
89
been given the indulgence of hearing of their appeal
on merits.  
19.Indeed,   this   case   reminds   us   of   the   subtle
observations of the learned Judge­Vivian Bose, J.,
which   His   Lordship   made   in   one   of   the   leading
cases of this Court in  Sangram Singh  vs. Election
Tribunal, Kotah,  AIR 1955 SC 425. 
20.Vivian Bose J., speaking for the Bench, in his
distinctive   style   of   writing   made   the   following
observations while dealing with the case arising out
of Order 9 and reminded the Courts of their duty
while deciding the case. The observations are apt
and read as under:
“A  code of procedure must  be regarded as
such. It is procedure something designed to
facilitate justice and further its ends: not a
penal   enactment   for   punishment   and
penalties; not a thing designed to trip people
up. Too technical a construction of sections
that leaves no room for reasonable elasticity
of interpretation should therefore be guarded
against (provided always that justice is done
910
to both sides) lest the very means designed
for   the   furtherance   of   justice   be   used   to
frustrate   it.   Our   laws   of   procedure   are
grounded   on   a   principle   of   natural   justice
which   requires   that   men   should   not   be
condemned   unheard,   that   decisions   should
not   be   reached   behind   their   backs,   that
proceedings   that   affect   their   lives   and
property   should   not   continue   in   their
absence   and   that   they   should   not   be
precluded   from   participating   in   them.   Of
course, there must be exceptions and where
they are clearly defined they must be given
effect to. But taken by and large, and subject
to that proviso, our laws of procedure should
be   construed,   wherever   that   is   reasonably
possible, in the light of that principle.” 
21.Keeping the aforementioned statement of law
in consideration and applying the same to the facts
of this case, we have no hesitation in allowing this
appeal and set aside the impugned order. 
22.In   our   view,   the   Courts   below   should   have
seen that the first appeal is a valuable right of the
appellant   and,   therefore,   the   appellant­Authority
was entitled for an opportunity to prosecute their
appeal on merits. If the appellant’s advocate did not
1011
appear may be for myriad reasons, the Court could
have imposed some cost on them for restoration of
their appeal to compensate the respondent(plaintiff)
instead of depriving them of their valuable right to
prosecute the appeal on merits. This is what Justice
Vivian   Bose   has   reminded   to   the   Courts   while
dealing with the cases of this nature in   Sangram
Singh (supra) to do substantial justice to both the
parties to the  lis. Indeed, dismissal of the appeal in
default and dismissal of the appeal on merits makes
a   difference.   The   former   dismissal   is   behind   the
back   of   the   litigant   and   latter   dismissal   is   after
hearing the litigant. The latter is always preferred
than the former. 
23.We have perused the application made by the
appellant­Authority for recalling of the order and we
find that it constitutes a sufficient cause within the
meaning   of   Order   41   Rule   19   of   the   Code.   The
1112
application,   therefore,   deserves   to   be   allowed.
However,   it   is   subject   to   payment   of   cost   of
Rs.10,000/­  payable by the appellant­Authority to
the respondent(plaintiff).  Let the cost be paid before
hearing of the appeal.
24.In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal
succeeds and is accordingly allowed. The impugned
order is set aside. As a consequence, the application
filed by the appellant (MA No.77/2014) is allowed.
The R.A. 370/2012 is accordingly restored to its
original   number   for   its   hearing   on   merits   in
accordance with law. 
25.Parties   are   directed   to   appear   before   the
concerned Appellate Court on 05.03.2019 to enable
the Appellate Court to fix a date for hearing of the
appeal   on   merits   uninfluenced   by   any   of   our
observations   on   the   merits  because  we  have   not
applied our mind to the merits of the controversy
1213
involved in the appeal. Let the appeal be heard and
disposed of as expeditiously as possible preferably
within six months from the date of this order.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3674 OF 2009
HARBHAJAN SINGH ETC. .....APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
STATE OF PUNJAB AND OTHERS .....RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
SANJIV KHANNA, J.
The  afore-captioned  Civil  Appeal  impugns  the  judgment
dated 6th July 2006 passed by the High Court of Punjab and
Haryana which dismissed five writ petitions challenging the vires
of the Punjab Religious Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent
Recovery) Act, 1997 (‘Religious Premises Act’, for short).
2.The  appellants  before  us  are  tenants  in  occupation  of  shops
located in Gurudwara  Singh Sabha, a gurudwara at Kukar Majra,
G.T. Road, Mandi Gobindgarh, District Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab.
The appellants claim that they were inducted as tenants during the
period 1965-69 by Gurudwara Singh Sabha.  However, no formal
lease or agreements were executed and albeit, over a period of
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 1 of 29time, rents were progressively increased.  The appellants further
claim that they are small businessmen carrying on trade primarily
connected with steel industry, while one of the appellants runs a
dhaba.  By the letter dated 2nd March 1978, the appellants were
informed that the affairs of the gurudwara had come under the
control of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (‘SGPC’
for short) and they should, therefore, pay the rent to SGPC.  It is
alleged that the appellants have been paying rent to SGPC or the
manager of the gurudwara but receipts have not been regularly
issued.
3.In the year 1997, SGPC had filed an eviction petition against one
of the appellants, Harbhajan Singh, under Section 13 of the East
Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 (‘East Punjab Rent Act’,
for short) on two grounds, viz., (i) failure to pay rent, and (ii) SGPC
needed the property for construction of shops.  Harbhajan Singh
had,  thereafter,  deposited  arrears  of  rent  on  the  first  date  of
hearing.   The  eviction  proceedings,  however,  had  remained
pending and were not decided. 
4.On 29th January 1998, the Religious Premises Act was enforced,
and  thereby  introduced  a  summary  procedure  for  evicting
unauthorised occupants from the premises/property belonging to
the religious institutions.  Thereafter, SGPC had filed ejectment
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 2 of 29petitions under the Religious Premises Act before the Collector for
eviction  of  the  appellants  stating  that  the  appellants  were  in
unauthorised occupation.  The appellants, on receipt of notices
from the Collector under Section 4 of the Religious Premises Act,
had filed the writ petitions challenging the vires of the enactment
before the High Court, which by the impugned judgment have
been dismissed.  The primary challenge before the High Court
was to the explanation to clause (a) to Section 3 of the Religious
Premises  Act  on  the  ground  that  the  provision  creates  an
unintelligible classification to the disadvantage of the tenants who
are otherwise entitled to equal protection as other tenants under
the East Punjab Rent Act.  
5.The pleas raised by the appellants were rejected by the Division
Bench of the High Court after referring to the object and purpose
behind the impugned enactment, that is, to preserve the property
of religious institutions, by observing that public at large has an
inherent interest in the “religious institutions” which were prone to
maladministration and mismanagement. Referring to the definition
of “unauthorised occupants”, it was observed that a person who is
in occupation of the premises belonging to a “religious institution”
on a valid allotment, lease or grant is not to be treated as an
“unauthorised occupant” for the period of allotment, lease or grant.
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 3 of 29The explanation states that mere payment of rent by the tenant
who is in unauthorised occupation shall not raise any presumption
that  such  person  had  entered  into  possession  as  an  allottee,
lessee  or  under  a  grant.   Referring  to  the  detailed  and
comprehensive procedure for eviction under Sections 4 and 5 of
the Religious Premises Act, it was held that the Collector has to be
satisfied that the opposite party was in “unauthorised occupation”
and  only  thereupon  an  eviction  order  can  be  passed  after
following  the  due  procedure.   A person  aggrieved  against  the
order  passed  by  the  Collector  can  file  an  appeal  before  the
Commissioner under Section 8 of the Act.  Referring to the factual
matrix, the High Court has observed that all contentions on merits
should  be  raised  before  the  authorities  under  the  Religious
Premises Act, in accordance with law.
6.The primary contention raised by the appellants before us is that
as tenants they are entitled to protection against eviction under
the East Punjab Rent Act, which protection it is submitted cannot
be withdrawn and taken away under the Religious Premises Act.
Further, the definition of “unauthorised occupants”, as a result of
explanation to clause (a) of Section 3, is highly unjust and unfair
as  a tenant  who  has  been  paying  rent  over  a  long  period  is
deemed  to  be  in  “unauthorised  occupation”  because  of  the
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 4 of 29termination of the lease, licence or grant, or the time stipulated in
the  lease,  license  or  grant  has  come  to  an  end.   This  it  is
submitted is unjust and unfair. The Religious Premises Act creates
an  artificial  classification  as  tenants  of  land  and  buildings
belonging to or owned by “religious institutions” are no longer
entitled to protection under the East Punjab Rent Act though such
protection continues to be available to other tenants.  Expansion
or construction of a new building by a religious institution as was
pleaded by SGPC in their eviction petition under the East Punjab
Rent Act would not justify eviction.  There is no public purpose or
objective in enacting the law, that is, the Religious Premises Act,
which has become a calculable device and means to increase
income  of  the  religious  institutions.  This  Court  in  Ashoka
Marketing  Ltd.  and  Another  v.  Punjab  National  Bank  and
Others1 had examined and rejected the challenge to the vires of
the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act,
1971 (‘Public Premises Act’, for short) after recording that the
property belonging to the government would fall under a separate
class and that the government, while dealing with the citizens in
respect of the property belonging to it, would not act for its own
purpose as a private landlord but would act in public interest.  This
is  a  crucial  distinction  between  the  government  and  private
1 (1990) 4 SCC 406
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 5 of 29landlords and, therefore, for the same reasoning in inverse, the
present appeal should be allowed as the Religious Premises Act
creates  an  artificial  distinction  and  discriminates  against  the
tenants of “religious institutions”, though “religious institutions” as
landlords are not a separate class. Thus, the Religious Premises
Act should be declared unconstitutional and illegal as it violates
Article 14 of the Constitution. 
7.The respondents, namely, the State of Punjab and also SGPC,
have  contested  the  said  submissions  and  contentions.   Their
submissions and contentions would be noticed in the subsequent
portion and in our reasoning below.
 
8.The East Punjab Rent Act was enacted in the year 1949, soon
after the Partition, with a view to protect tenants and to curtail the
right of the landlords to seek eviction notwithstanding the contract
under  the  provisions  of  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act,  1882,
(“Transfer of Property Act”, for short) which is a general enactment
regulating landlord and tenant relationships.  There cannot be any
doubt that the State legislature, that is, the Legislative Assembly of
the State of Punjab is entitled to enact the Religious Premises Act,
despite the fact that they had enacted the East Punjab Rent Act.
We must accept and take judicial notice by acknowledging that the
State legislature while enacting the Religious Premises Act was
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 6 of 29aware  that  it  has  enacted  East  Punjab  Rent  Act,  an  existing
statute governing landlord and tenant relationship. However, the
State legislature in its wisdom has deemed it appropriate to enact
a  law  in  respect  of  land  and  buildings  belonging  to  “religious
institutions”.  The vires of the Religious Premises Act, a special
enactment concerning landlord and tenant relationships, cannot
be challenged on the ground that there are already two other
enactments governing general landlord and tenant relationships
(Transfer  of  Property  Act  and  East  Punjab  Rent  Act).  The
Constitution confers the power and authority on the State to enact
two  separate  enactments  on  a  similar  subject  if  they  seek  to
achieve  different  objectives  and  protect  and  preserve  different
sets of rights and make necessary classification to serve such
varied ends. The Religious Premises Act, unlike the East Punjab
Rent Act and the Public Premises Act, concerns itself with the
administration of premises belonging to religious institutions and
seeks to regulate their rights as landlords vis-à-vis the tenants in
occupation. In this regard, reference can be made to the object
and purpose behind enacting the Religious Premises Act, which is
as follows:
“Since  long  various  religious  institutions  have  been
representing  to  the  Government  for  vacation  of  their
premises  under  unauthorised  occupation.  On  careful
thought  being  given  by  the  Government,  the  State
Government  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  religious
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 7 of 29institutions are facing a lot of difficulties in this behalf. It
is, therefore, expedient for the State Government to help
the religious institutions in getting their premises which
are  under  unauthorised  occupation  vacated  through
summary  proceedings.  Hence,  the  Punjab  Religious
Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery) Bill,
1996.” 
9.Section  2(d)  of  the  Religious  Premises  Act  defines  “religious
institution”.  Section 2(e) defines ‘religious premises’ and Section 3
defines  “unauthorised  occupation  of  religious  premises  by  a
person”.  These provisions read as under:
“(d)  ""Religious  Institution'  means  any  gurudwara,
temple, church, mosque, temple of Jains or Budhas -
which  is  registered  under  the  provisions  of  the
Societies Registration Act, 1860 (Central Act No. XXI of
1860) or is established under any statute and includes
any other place of worship by whatever name, it may
be  called,  which  is  registered  as  aforesaid  or  is
established under any statute;
(e) ""religious premises"", means any land whether used
for  agricultural  or  non-agricultural  purposes,  or  any
building or part of a building belonging to a Religious
Institution and includes, -
(i)the  garden,  grounds  and  out-houses,  if  any,
appertaining to such building or part of a building;
and
(ii)any  fittings  affixed  to  such  building  or  part  of  a
building for the more beneficial enjoyment thereof;”
xxx
3. Unauthorised occupation of religious premises. - For
the purposes of this Act, a person shall be deemed to
be  in  unauthorised  occupation  of  any  religious
premises-
(a)  where  he  has,  whether  before  or  after  the
commencement of this Act,  entered into possession
thereof otherwise than under and in pursuance of any
allotment, lease or grant; or
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 8 of 29(b) where he, being an allottee, lessee or grantee has,
by reason of the determination or cancellation of his
allotment, lease or grant in accordance with the terms
in  that  behalf  therein  contained,  ceased,  whether
before or after the commencement of this Act, to be
entitled to occupy or hold such religious premises; or
(c)  where  any  person  authorised  to  occupy  any
religious  premises  has,  whether  before  or  after  the
commencement of this Act, -
(i) sub-let, in contravention of the terms of allotment,
lease or grant, without the permission of the Religious
Institution,  the  whole  or  any  part  of  such  religious
premises; or
(ii)  otherwise  acted  in  contravention  of  any  of  the
terms, express or implied, under which he is authorised
to occupy such religious premises.
Explanation. - For the purpose of clause (a), a person
shall not merely by reason of the fact that he has paid
any rent be deemed to have entered into possession
as allottee, lessee or grantee.”
“Religious  institution”  means  any  gurudwara,  temple,  church,
mosque or temple of Jains or Buddhists which is registered under
the  provisions  of  the  Societies  Registration  Act  or  established
under  any  statute.   It  also  includes  any  place  of  worship  by
whatever  name  called  which  is  registered  as  aforesaid  or
established under any statute.  The definition is clear and no
contention  or  issue  is  raised  that  the  definition  of  the  term
“religious institution” is vague or incomprehensible.  Similarly, the
expression “religious premises” has been defined in clear terms to
mean land used for agricultural or non-agricultural purposes or
any  building  or  part  of  the  building  belonging  to  a  religious
institution. The definition clarifies that the expression “religious
premises” would include garden, ground and out-house or any
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 9 of 29fittings in the building or part of the building for more beneficial
enjoyment.  The expression “unauthorised occupation” is of some
importance in view of the challenge and the contentions raised.  A
person  is  deemed  to  be  in  unauthorised  occupation  of  any
religious premises if he has, before or after commencement of the
Religious  Premises  Act,  entered  into  possession  of  a  land  or
building belonging to a religious institution otherwise than under or
pursuant to any allotment, lease or grant.  A person who enters
into possession of the land or building belonging to or owned by a
religious institution and has valid and subsisting allotment, lease
or grant is clearly not an unauthorised occupant.  Such allottees,
lessees or persons in whose favour there is a grant, allotment or
lease  that  entitles  the  person  to  retain  possession  are  fully
protected and cannot be evicted.  In other words, primacy to the
terms of allotment, lease or grant is not interfered, and is duly
accorded. The terms of the allotment, lease or grant would be
binding. Clause (b) states that if the allotment, lease or grant has
been  determined  or  cancelled  whether  before  or  after  the
commencement of the Religious Premises Act, occupation of the
person would be treated as unauthorised occupation.    Clause (c)
states that where a person is authorised to occupy any religious
premises,  before  or  after  commencement  of  the  Religious
Premises Act, has sublet the religious premises in contravention of
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 10 of 29the  terms  of  allotment,  lease  or  grant,  or  otherwise  acted  in
contravention of the terms, express or implied, he shall be treated
as an “unauthorised occupant”.  No contention, issue or objection
has  been  raised  viz.  clause  (c)  to  Section  3.   Explanation  to
Section 3 states that for the purpose of clause (a), which makes
the term of allotment, lease or grant as a basis for determining
whether a person is in authorised or unauthorised occupation,
shall not be affected by the mere reason or the fact that such
person has paid rent and, therefore, is deemed to have entered
into  possession  as  an  allottee,  lessee  or  guarantee.  In  other
words, payment of rent would not be a determinative and relevant
factor  in  deciding  the  issue  and  question  of  “unauthorised
occupation”. The tenure of allotment, lease or the grant and terms
and conditions as agreed or stated, and not mere payment of rent
would be the crucial and determinative criterion. 
10.Under  Section  4  of  the  Religious  Premises  Act,  a  religious
institution can make an application before the Collector if it is of
the opinion that any person is in unauthorised occupation of any
religious premises, situated within the Collector’s jurisdiction.  The
Collector thereupon is required to issue notice in writing calling
upon the person to show-cause why the eviction order should not
be made.  Sub-section (2) prescribes the requirement of a notice
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 11 of 29and sub-section (3) to Section 4 prescribes the manner in which
the notice is to be served.  Under Section 5, the Collector is
authorised and is competent to pass an order of eviction after
considering the cause, if any, shown by the person to whom notice
under  Section  4  has  been  issued  and  after  examining  the
evidence that may be produced by such person.  The person in
occupation has to be given reasonable opportunity of being heard.
The statutory requirement is that the Collector should be satisfied
that the religious premises are in unauthorised occupation before
he can make the order of eviction.  The Collector must also record
reasons.  The Collector is required to pass an order within a
period of 45 days from the date of receipt of the application under
Section 4 and the order passed has to be affixed on the outer door
or on some other conspicuous part of the religious premises.  If a
person fails to comply with the order of eviction within 30 days
from the date of the order, the Collector, or any other officer duly
authorised by him, can evict the person and deliver possession of
the religious premises to the religious institution.  He is entitled to
use force as may be necessary. The tenant, if aggrieved, can file
an appeal against the Collector’s order before the Commissioner.
Thereafter, the tenant is entitled to also invoke the writ jurisdiction
of the High Court under Articles 227 and 226 of the Constitution of
India if the grievance still persists.
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 12 of 2911.The issue of whether the properties of the religious institutions for
the  purpose  of  rent  control  legislations  can  be  treated  as  a
separate category is no longer  res integra  as this aspect was
examined  in  several  decisions where this Court  has held that
separate classification of properties of religious institutions for rent
legislations  will  pass  a  challenge  under  Article  14  of  the
Constitution.  In  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Others  v.
Nallamilli Rami Reddi and Others2, this Court was faced with a
challenge to the validity of Section 82 of the Andhra Pradesh
Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act,
1987  which  had  cancelled  the  leases  of  tenants  of  properties
belonging to or given or endowed for the purpose of any charitable
or  any  religious  institution  or  endowment  falling  under  the
enactment,  notwithstanding  the  prevailing  tenancy  laws  in  the
State of Andhra Pradesh, in order to augment the rents payable
for such properties which stood frozen on account of the tenancy
laws  and  since  sale  of  such  lands  was  not  feasible.  While
examining the question of religious institutions as a separate and
distinguishable class, this Court had expounded on the scope of
Article 14 of the Constitution and the kind of classification that
would stand the test of Article 14 of the Constitution, as under: 
2 AIR 2001 SC 3616
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 13 of 29“8. What  Article  14  of  the  Constitution  prohibits  is
“class legislation” and not “classification for purpose of
legislation”.  If  the  legislature  reasonably  classifies
persons for legislative purposes so as to bring them
under a well-defined class, it is not open to challenge
on the ground of denial of equal treatment that the law
does  not  apply  to  other  persons.  The  test  of
permissible  classification  is  twofold:  (i)  that  the
classification must be founded on intelligible differentia
which  distinguishes  persons  grouped  together  from
others  who  are  left  out  of  the  group,  and  (ii)  that
differentia must have a rational connection to the object
sought to be achieved. Article 14 does not insist upon
classification, which is scientifically perfect or logically
complete. A classification would be justified unless it is
patently arbitrary. If there is equality and uniformity in
each group,  the  law  will  not become  discriminatory,
though due to some fortuitous circumstance arising out
of peculiar situation some included in a class get an
advantage over others so long as they are not singled
out for special treatment. In substance, the differentia
required is that it must be real and substantial, bearing
some just and reasonable relation to the object of the
legislation.”
Holding the above, this Court in  Nallamilli Rami Reddi  (supra)
had reversed the decision of the Division Bench of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court observing that religious institutions fall into a
separate  category  and  land  or property  held  by  them  have  a
special character. Clearly, the tenants under a religious institution
would  form  a  separate  class  by  themselves  and  such
classification, if made, would achieve the object of promoting the
interests of the religious institutions. Therefore, classification of
properties of “religious institutions” as a separate and distinctive
class of properties would not fall foul or be violative of Article 14 of
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 14 of 29the Constitution.  It was elucidated that whether a tenancy act
should be applicable to religious institutions or should be kept out
is not an aspect which the Court would decide. It is instead for the
legislature to determine the extent of applicability of such tenancy
laws  to  religious  institutions  and  the  extent  of  protection  that
should be made available. This Court has, therefore, rejected the
argument  that  religious  institutions  as  landlords  or  tenants  of
religious institutions cannot be treated and regarded as a separate
category  in  respect  of  whom  protection  as  available  to  other
tenants  under  the  rent  law  would  not  be  available.  Such
classification cannot be a ground or the basis to interfere with the
validity of an act or provision.  However, the Courts can interfere
when the policy is irrational.  Summing up the ratio, this court in
Nallamilli Rami Reddi  (supra) had held:
“15. We may sum up the upshot of our discussion:
1.That  charitable  or  religious  institutions  or
endowments fall into a separate category and form
a class by themselves. If that is so, tenants coming
under them also form a separate class. Therefore,
they can be treated differently from others.
2.In operation of the Act it is possible that it may
result in hardship to some of the tenants but that by
itself will not be a consideration to condemn the
Act.
3.The  manner  in  which  the  charitable  or  religious
institution  or  endowment  would  deal  with  the
properties that are resumed after the provisions of
Section 82 of the Act come into force by cancelling
the existing leases, is in the region of speculation.
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 15 of 294.Fresh tenancy can be entered into and there is no
material before the court as to what was the rent
paid by tenants at the time when the Act came into
force, in terms of Section 18(2) of the Act or as
provided  under  the  Andhra  Act  or  under  the
Telangana Act. In the absence of such a material, it
would  be  hazardous  for  the  court  to  reach  any
conclusion, one way or the other, to state that the
tenants would be frozen and, therefore, there is no
likelihood  of  charitable  or  religious  institution  or
endowment  getting  higher  rents.  If  there  is  no
material one way or the other, the presumption that
the Act is good should prevail.
5.It is a matter of policy with the legislature as to
whether all provisions of the Tenancy Acts should
be  exempt  in its application  to  the charitable  or
religious institution or endowment in their entirety.
6.The identification of “landless poor persons” and
protection given to them is justified as enunciated
earlier.
7.It will be very difficult to predict at this stage that the
result  of  Section  82  of  the  Act  would  be  so
hazardous as not to achieve the object for which it
was enacted. It would not only result in displacing
the old tenants by new tenants, it may also achieve
other  social  objectives  in  another  manner.  If
appropriate provisions are made under the Rules
and if the leases are given to small holders of land,
another social objective could be achieved.
8.In what manner charitable or religious institution or
endowment would deal with matters of this nature
is  mere  guesswork  at  this  stage.  On  some
hypothetical  approach  the  High  Court  could  not
have declared a law to be invalid.”
Therefore,  it  was  clearly  held  that  tenants  of  religious
institutions fall in a separate class which is identifiable.  Further,
on the question, whether cancellation of a “lease” in their favour
would  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  act  in  question,  it  was
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 16 of 29observed, that there was no material before the Court to show that
such  cancellation  would  not  carry  out  the  purposes  of  the
“religious institutions”.
12.There have been number of central and state legislations wherein
religious institutions with or without other charitable organisations
have been treated as a separate and distinct class and accorded
legal  treatment  concomitant  to  such  distinctiveness  within  the
scope  of  the  same  enactment  or  other  enactments.  {See  –
Sections 11 and 115BBC, the Income Tax Act, 1961; Karnataka
Rent Act, 1999 and Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and
Charitable  Endowments  Act,  1997;  Orissa  Hindu  Religious
Endowments Act, 1951; Himachal Pradesh Hindu Public Religious
Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 1984 as amended in
2018; Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent
and  Eviction)  Act,  1972  and  Goa,  Daman  and  Diu  Buildings
(Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control  Act, 1968, among others }.
13.We  would  like  to  refer  to  a  decision  of  this  Court  in  S.
Kandaswamy Chettiar  v.  State of Tamil Nadu and Another3
wherein  challenge  was  made  to  the  exemption  granted  to
buildings owned by Hindu, Christian and Muslim religious public
trusts and public charitable trusts from the provisions of the Tamil
3 AIR 1985 SC 257
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 17 of 29Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960, by delegated
legislation, in the form of an exemption notification issued under
Section 29 of the above Act.  A three Judge Bench of this Court in
S. Kandaswamy Chettiar  (supra) referred to the judgment of a
five Judge Bench of this Court in  P.J. Irani  v.  State of Madras4
wherein  identical  provisions  contained  in  earlier  enactment,
namely, the Madras Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1959
were upheld in the context of Article 14 of the Constitution of India
on the basis that the Preamble and operative provisions of that Act
gave  sufficient  guidance  for  exercise  of  discretionary  power
vested  with  the  State  Government.   Whether  a  notification
granting exemption to buildings belonging to charities, religious or
secular institutions would violate the equal protection mandate of
Article  14,  it  was  observed,  that  Article  14  requires  that  the
classification must be based on rational grounds, that is, grounds
germane to carrying out the policy or the purpose of the Act and
by way of illustration it was stated that if such exemptions were
granted  in  favour  of  all  the  buildings  belonging  to  charities,
religious  or  secular  institutions,  such  classification  would  be
reasonable  and  proper  being  based  on  intelligible  differentia
having nexus to the object sought to be achieved.  Rent Act, it was
observed,  would  unquestionably  be  a  piece  of  beneficial
4 AIR 1961 SC 1731
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 18 of 29legislation intended to remedy the two evils, that is, rack-rentingꟷ
extraction of exorbitant rents and unreasonable eviction orders
generated by a largescale influx of population to big cities and
urban areas post the Second World War creating acute shortage
of accommodation in such areas.  Rent enactments overtly protect
the rights of the tenants in occupation of buildings in such areas
from  being  charged  unreasonable  rents  and  from  being
unreasonably evicted.  Therefore, such enactments even protect
tenancy after determination or end of their contractual periods by
enlarging the definition of the term ‘tenant’.  At the same time, the
rent enactments often contain other significant provisions which
indicate that the legislature itself felt that there may be areas and
cases  where  these  two  evils  were  neither  prevalent  nor
apprehended,  and  as  such  landlords’  freedom  need  not  be
curtailed at all.  It is in this context that several enactments give
wider latitude to the landlords of religious, charitable, educational
and  other  public  institutions  if  the  possession  is  required  for
purposes of such institutions.  In other words, the legislature is
entitled and can make rational classification of buildings belonging
to  government  and  those  belonging  to  religious,  charitable,
educational  and  other  public  institutions  which  are  accorded
different  treatment  on  the  well-founded  assumption  that  such
landlords  are  not  expected  to  and  would  not  indulge  in  rack-
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 19 of 29renting or unreasonable eviction.  Relying upon the observations
in  P.J.  Irani  (supra),  it  was  held  that  constitutional  validity  of
granting exemption to buildings belonging to charities, religious or
secular institutions, from rent control legislation, would not offend
the equal protection clause of Article 14 of the Constitution as it is
a  reasonable  classification  based  on  intelligible  differentia  and
also satisfies the test of nexus as such institutions not only serve
public purpose but disbursement of their income is governed by
the objects for which they are created. The income and activities
are not for private benefit.  Reference in this regard was made to
the counter affidavit wherein the government had explained that
they were satisfied that the rents received by exempted religious
institutions  were  very  low,  meagre  and  that  the  provisions  of
fixation of fair rent under the rent act would not meet the ends of
justice  and  would  in  fact  result  in  the  tenant  exploiting  the
situation.  Consequently, withdrawal of protection to the tenants of
such buildings was justified.  It was observed in S. Kandaswamy
Chettiar (supra) as under:
“11... In our view, the aforesaid material clearly shows
that buildings belonging to such public religious and
charitable endowments or trusts clearly fell into a class
where undue hardship and injustice resulting to them
from the uniform application of the beneficial provisions
of the Act needed to be relieved and the exemption
granted will have to be regarded as being germane to
the policy and purposes of the Act.  In other words the
classification made has a clear nexus with the object
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 20 of 29with  which  the  power  to  grant  exemption  has  been
conferred upon the State Government under S.29 of
the Act.
xx xx xx
14...  It  is  obvious  that  if  the  trustees  of  the  public
religious  trusts  and  public  charities  are  to  be  given
freedom to charge the normal market rent then to make
that freedom effective it will be necessary to arm the
trustees  with  the  right  to  evict  the  tenants  for  non-
payment of such market rent.  The State Government
on materials before it came to the conclusion that the
‘fair rent’ fixed under the Act was unjust in case of such
buildings and it was necessary to permit the trustees of
such buildings to recover from their tenants reasonable
market  rent  and  if  that  be  so  non-eviction  when
reasonable  market  rent  is  not  paid  would  be
unreasonable  and  if the  market  rent  is  paid  by  the
tenants  no  trustee  is  going  to  evict  them.   It  is,
therefore, clear that granting total exemption cannot be
regarded as excessive or unwarranted.
15.   Apart  from  this  aspect  of  the  matter  it  is
conceivable that trustees of buildings belonging to such
public  religious  institutions  or  public  charities  may
desire  eviction  of  their  tenants  for  the  purpose  of
carrying  out  major  or  substantial  repairs  or  for  the
purpose of demolition and reconstruction and the State
Government may have felt that the trustees of such
buildings  should  be  able  to  effect  evictions  without
being required to fulfil other onerous conditions which
must be complied with by private landlords when they
seek  evictions  for  such  purposes.   In  our  view,
therefore, the total exemption granted to such buildings
under the impugned notification is perfectly justified.”
14.These  two  judgments  were  followed  by  the  two  Judge  Bench
decision  of  this  Court  in  Christ  the  King  Cathedral  v.  John
Ancheril  and  Another5 wherein  similar  exemption  notification
5 (2001) 6 SCC 170
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 21 of 29under the Kerala Buildings ( Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965
granting  exemption  in  public  interest  to  the  buildings  of  all
churches/mosques of all minority religions and of all Dioceses,
Archdioceses,  Monasteries,  etc.  was  challenged.   One  of  the
contentions raised was that no data or material was produced by
the State and hence the decision and ratio in  S. Kandaswamy
Chettiar  (supra)  would  not  be  applicable.   Rejecting  the  said
contention, it was observed:
“6. The law had been stated by this Court to the effect
that public religious or charitable endowments or trusts
constitute a well-recognised group which serves not
only public purposes, but disbursement of their income
is governed by the objects with which they are created
and buildings belonging to such endowments or trusts
clearly fall into a class distinct from the buildings owned
by private landlords. It is in respect of three areas a
regulation would be made under the Act, as has been
done in other similar enactments and these areas are:
(i)  with  respect  to  regulation  of  lease  of  buildings
(residential  or  non-residential);  (ii)  control  of  rent  of
such buildings; and (iii) control of eviction of tenants
from such buildings. A public trust, as has been held in
S.  Kandaswamy  Chettiar  case  is  not  likely  to  act
unreasonably either in the matter of enhancement of
rent or eviction of tenants being institutions of religion
or charity. On that basis, this Court upheld the validity
of the exemption granted under the Tamil Nadu Act in
favour of such trust or endowment. In the present case,
the contention has been specifically put forth that the
appellants fall  into that very category which came up
for consideration before this Court in S. Kandaswamy
Chettiar case. Therefore, no distinction can be made
between that class of owners of the buildings in that
case and in the present case. We do not understand as
to what other material was required by the Court in a
matter of this nature if the contention put forth before
this Court is not that churches or mosques, dioceses,
archdioceses,  monasteries,  convents,  wakfs  and
madarsas are not religious and charitable in nature.
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 22 of 297. Shri  Nageswara  Rao,  the  learned  counsel
appearing  for  the  contesting  respondents  submitted
that  there  is  total  non-application  of  mind  by  the
Government in the matter of grant  of exemption and
the guidelines indicated in  S. Kandaswamy Chettiar
case have not been followed in the present case and,
therefore, the exemption should not have been granted
in the present case. In S. Kandaswamy Chettiar case
an affidavit had been filed as to the lower rents that
were being paid and that the tenants were exploiting
the situation and had brought the charitable institutions
to  a  situation  of  helplessness  and  that  position  not
having been challenged the Court made those orders.
If we bear in mind the fact that the purpose of the Act is
apparently to prevent unreasonable eviction and also
to control rent and if the trustees of religious and public
charities are given freedom to charge normal market
rent with the further freedom to evict the tenants for not
paying such market rent, the result would be unjust and
cause hardship to them. But apprehension, by itself, is
not sufficient. There is no material on record to show
that in any of these cases the landlords would resort to
such  a course  of  action.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the
building  belonging  to  such  public  trust  or  religious
institution is exempt from the Act, the purpose of the
trust could be carried out much better, is quite clear. If
that  is  the  object  with  which  the  Government  has
granted exemption, we do not think there is any reason
to quash the notifications impugned before the High
Court.
xx xx xx
9. An argument is sought to be raised on the basis of
ownership of property that there should not have been
a distinction as is being made in the present case. That
was  the  very  basis  of  distinction  made  in  case  of
statutory  bodies  like  the  Housing  Board,  local
authorities which was noticed in  Jayakaran v.  Kerala
Health R & W Society case  or registered wakfs which
was considered in  Lakshmanan v.  Mohamood. When
such bodies or institutions fall into a distinct class by
themselves  and  exemption  granted  to  them  would
serve a public purpose, namely, to carry out the objects
of the trust or the endowment or religious activity in a
broad  sense, we do not think that the fine distinction
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 23 of 29sought to be made by the High Court in this regard is
justified.
15.Appropriate at  this stage would also be reference to two earlier
decisions of this Court which had examined the provisions of the
rent control legislations, namely, Kewal Singh v. Smt. Lajwanti6
and Ravi Dutt Sharma v. Ratan Lal Bhargava7.
16.In Kewal Singh (supra), the challenge made was to the provisions
of summary eviction in case of  bona fide  requirement under the
Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958.  It was observed that the rent control
legislations are a piece of social legislations and are meant mainly
to protect tenants from frivolous evictions but, at the same time,
they  must  do  justice  to  the  landlord  and  to  this  extent  the
enactment should avoid placing such restrictions on their right to
evict  the  tenants  so  as  to  destroy  the  legal  right  to  property.
Therefore, the landlords have been given certain statutory rights
under the rent enactments to seek eviction and these provisions
provide relief.  In the absence of such rent control legislations, a
landlord has the right in law to evict the tenant either on the
termination of tenancy by efflux of time or other grounds after
giving notice under the Transfer of Property Act.  Such rights have
been curtailed by the rent control legislations to give protection to
6 AIR 1980 SC 1617 AIR 1984 SC 967
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 24 of 29tenants having regard to the genuine and dire needs but these
should not be construed to destroy the rights which have been
given to the landlords.  It was observed:
“21. There is yet another important aspect of the matter
which may be mentioned here. Prior to the enactment
of  the  rent  control  legislation  in  our  country,  the
relationship of landlord and tenant was governed by
our  common  law  viz.  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act
(Sections 107 to 111). The tenant was inducted with
his tacit agreement to be regulated by the conditions
embodied in the contract and could not be allowed to
repudiate the agreement reached between him and the
landlord during that period. The tenant was, therefore,
bound in law to vacate the premises either voluntarily
or  through  a  suit  after  he  was  given  a  notice  as
required  by  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act  under  the
terms and conditions of the lease. However, as a piece
of social reform in order to protect the tenants from
capricious  and  frivolous  eviction,  the  legislature
stepped in and afforded special protection to the tenant
by conferring on him the status of a statutory tenant
who could not be evicted except under the conditions
specified and the procedure prescribed by the Rent
Control  Acts. Thus  to  this extent,  the  agreement  of
lease and the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act
stood superseded. At the same time, the Rent Control
Acts provided the facilities of eviction to the landlord on
certain  specified  grounds  like  bona  fide  personal
necessity or default in payment of rent, etc. Thus any
right that the tenant possessed after the expiry of the
lease was conferred on him only by virtue of the Rent
Control  Act.  It  is,  therefore,  manifest  that  if  the
legislature considered in its wisdom to confer certain
rights  or  facilities  on  the  tenants,  it  could  due  to
changed circumstances curtail, modify, alter or even
take away such rights or the procedure enacted for the
purpose of eviction and leave the tenants to seek their
remedy under the common law.
22. Thus, we do not see how can the tenant challenge
the  validity  of  such  a  provision  enacted  by  the
legislature from which the tenant itself derived such
rights.”
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 25 of 2917.Similar are the observations of this Court in  Ravi Dutt Sharma
(supra) which had quoted several passages from  Kewal Singh
(supra) to observe that it is open to the legislature to pick out one
class of landlords out of several covered under a specific provision
of a rent enactment so long as they form a class by themselves
and  the  legislature  was  free  to  provide  benefit  of  a  special
procedure to them in the matter of eviction against the tenants as
long as the legislation had the object to achieve and a special
procedure has reasonable nexus to the object to be achieved.
18.In  Ashoka Marketing Ltd.  (supra), the five Judge Constitution
Bench of this Court had upheld applicability of the Public Premises
Act to a corporation established by a Central Act that is owned
and controlled by the Central Government, therein a nationalised
bank.   After  referring  to  several  judgments,  this  Court  had
explained the effect of Article 14 of the Constitution observing that
the two statutes, namely, the Rent Control Act and the Public
Premises Act were enacted by the same legislature, that is, the
Parliament, in exercise of powers for matters enumerated in the
Concurrent List.  The Public Premises Act being a later enactment
would  prevail  over  the  provisions  of  the  Rent  Control  Act  in
respect of public premises.  Referring to the provisions of the Rent
Control Act, it was observed:
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 26 of 29“55. The Rent Control Act makes a departure from the
general law regulating the relationship of landlord and
tenant  contained  in  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act
inasmuch  as  it  makes  provision  for  determination  of
standard  rent,  it  specifies  the  grounds  on  which  a
landlord can seek the eviction of a tenant, it prescribes
the forum for adjudication of disputes between landlords
and tenants and the procedure which has to be followed
in  such  proceedings.  The  Rent  Control  Act  can,
therefore, be said to be a special statute regulating the
relationship of landlord and tenant in the Union territory
of Delhi. The Public Premises Act makes provision for a
speedy  machinery  to  secure  eviction  of  unauthorised
occupants  from  public  premises.  As  opposed  to  the
general law which provides for filing of a regular suit for
recovery of possession of property in a competent court
and  for  trial  of  such  a  suit  in  accordance  with  the
procedure laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, the
Public Premises Act confers the power to pass an order
of  eviction  of  an  unauthorised  occupant  in  a  public
premises  on  a  designated  officer  and  prescribes  the
procedure  to  be  followed  by  the  said  officer  before
passing such an order. Therefore, the Public Premises
Act  is  also  a  special  statute  relating  to  eviction  of
unauthorised occupants from public premises. In other
words, both the enactments, namely, the Rent Control
Act and the Public Premises Act, are special statutes in
relation  to  the  matters  dealt  with  therein.  Since,  the
Public  Premises  Act  is  a  special  statute  and  not  a
general  enactment  the  exception  contained  in  the
principle that a subsequent general law cannot derogate
from an earlier special law cannot be invoked and in
accordance  with  the  principle  that  the  later  laws
abrogate earlier contrary laws, the Public Premises Act
must prevail over the Rent Control Act.”
19.What has been said about the Public Premises Act  would be
equally applicable to the legislations made by the State legislature
of the State of Punjab in respect of the two enactments under
consideration, that is, the East Punjab Rent Act and the Religious
Premises Act.  No doubt, in this decision it has been observed that
the underlying reason for exclusion of property belonging to the
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 27 of 29government from the ambit of the Rent Control Act is that the
government while dealing with the citizens in respect of property
belonging to it would not act as a private landlord but would act in
public  interest,  albeit  this  reasoning  would  equally  apply  to
“religious institutions” as defined.  The religious institutions as held
are meant to carry out public purpose and the legislature can
proceed  accordingly  that  the  religious  institutions  would  act  in
public interest for which they were established. { See above  S.
Kandaswamy Chettiar  (supra) and  Christ the King Cathedral
(supra)}
20.As noticed above, valid grants, leases and allotments are not
construed and treated as unauthorised occupation.  It is only when
the terms of the grant, lease or allotment are not adhered to or
have been determined or the period of allotment, lease or grant as
fixed has come to an end, that the person in occupation is treated
to be in unauthorised occupation. This is a pre-condition which
confers the right on the religious institution to seek eviction of a
person  in  unauthorised  occupation  of  the  religious  premises.
Further, an order passed by the Collector is appealable before the
Commissioner and if still aggrieved, a tenant can invoke the writ
jurisdiction of the High Court, as mentioned above. Therefore,
Civil Appeal No. 3674 of 2009 Page 28 of 29power of judicial review is always available and can be exercised
by the High Court when required and necessary.
21.Accordingly, we do not find any merit in the present appeal and
the same is dismissed.  However, in the facts of this case, there
would be no order as to costs.

REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO.415 OF 2007
TATA POWER COMPANY LTD. …APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
ADANI ELECTRICITY MUMBAI LTD. 
& ORS.                                          …RESPONDENT(S)
WITH
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3229 OF 2007
J U D G M E N T
Arun Mishra, J.
1.The appellant – Tata Power Company (in short ‘the TPC’) is a
distribution licensee supplying electricity to the entire city of Mumbai,
whereas   BSES/Reliance   Energy   Limited   (in   short   ‘REL’)   is   a
distribution   licensee   supplying   electricity   only   in   the   suburbs   of
Mumbai.     Prior   to   1998,   the   TPC   was   the   only   generator   of   the
electricity supplying electricity to BSES for further supply to BSES
customers.  The TPC had 108 customers in the entire city of Mumbai.
The tariff payable by BSES to TPC included a component of standby
charge.  The entire standby charges paid by TPC to Maharashtra State
Electricity Board (for short ‘the MSEB’) were being recovered by TPC2
from its customers through its tariff.  Due to change in shareholding
pattern,   the   BSES   was   changed   to   Reliance   Energy   Limited   on
24.2.2004. 
2.The brief facts indicate that TPC and MSEB met on 12.3.1985 to
finalise the interconnection between representatives of TPC and MSEB
with respect to demand charges.  Following decision was arrived at:
 “  A) Demand Charges: 
Effective 1­2­84 a monthly firmed demand of 300 MVA would be
billed  by   MSEB.     This   would   increase  by   50   MVA   each   year
effective   1­4­1985   to   take   care   of   TEC’s   own   load   growth
annually.     This   is   irrespective   of   TEC’s   actual   net   off­take
recorded   at   the   4   interconnecting   points   of   supply   and   also
irrespective of MSEB’s total off­take from TEC system”
3.Prior to 1985, the TPC was supplying entire electricity generated
by it to the distributors of electricity in Mumbai.  Since the quantity
generated by TPC was not sufficient to meet the entire demand, TPC
used to buy electricity from MSEB.   BSES/REL was purchasing its
entire requirement of electricity from TPC in bulk to supply to its
customers in suburban Mumbai.
4.With effect from 1985, TPC wanted to increase its generating
capacity thereby reducing its offtake of electricity from MSEB to zero
thereby causing loss of revenue to MSEB.   In order to compensate
MSEB for loss of revenue caused as a result of stoppage of purchase of
electricity   by   TPC   from   MSEB,   the   TPC   and   MSEB   entered   into
aforesaid arrangement whereby TPC was required to pay to MSEB3
standby facility initially for 300 MVA to be increased by 50 MVA every
year, charges to be paid at the rate fixed by MSEB.  The quantum of
standby increased from 300 MVA to 550 MVA by the  year 1990,
whereafter the MSEB and the TPC agreed not to increase the said
standby beyond 550 MVA.  The standby facility was meant to enable
TPC to draw upon the energy generated by MSEB in the event there
was outage/failure of power in TPC’s generation capacity of 1777 MW
consisting of multiple units of different sizes i.e., 500 MW, 180 MW,
150   MW,   72   MW,   75   MW   and   300   MW,   which   is   supplied   to
BSES/REL   along   with   its   own   consumers   and   BEST,   another
distribution licensee in Mumbai.  The standby facilities charges paid
by TPC to MSEB were factored into tariff charged by TPC from its
customers including BSES/REL.  The BSES/REL was a purchaser of
electricity from TPC to the extent of TPC’s generation between 29% to
37% from 1998 to 2006, thus the standby charges to the extent of
aforesaid varying percentages for the respective years were borne by
BSES/REL which in turn were factored into tariff and charged by
BSES/REL to its retail customers.
5.Initially, BSES was permitted to set up its generating plant at
Dahanu to generate 500 MW (550 MVA approximately).  There was a
condition that it would achieve interconnection with the supply of TPC4
at a point known as Borivali Interconnection Point in case there was
any   outage   of   BSES   generation.     It   could   draw   upon   the   power
supplied by the TPC.  The charges for such interconnections were to
be determined.  On 30.5.1992, a notification was issued amending the
BSES license.  A new clause 7B was introduced for providing aforesaid
interconnectivity.   Provisions of clause 13A were also amended to
authorise the State Government in the event of a dispute to decide the
same.  On 29.6.1992, a meeting was held between TPC and BSES and
it was agreed that interconnection would be provided at Borivali GIS
switching station to take care of emergencies in BSES 220 KV system.
The   TPC   already   have   arrangements   with   MSEB   wherein   standby
capacity is provided by MSEB to TPC in case of emergencies in TPC
system.  Standby capacity to BSES may be provided from the standby
capacity   reserved   by   TPC   with   MSEB   and   appropriate   sharing   of
charges by BSES could be worked out as provided in clause 12.0.  The
BSES prior to September 1995 was purchasing its entire requirement
of power from TPC and distributing it within its licensed area as TPC
distributing licensee.   After its two Dahanu generating units were
commissioned in January/March 1995, BSES started bringing the
power   generated   by   Dahanu   to   supply   to   its   consumers   after
September  1995  in  the  suburbs  of  Mumbai  city.   As  supply  was5
started from the Dahanu, TPC surplus capacity began to increase.
The TPC after 1995 required only 275 MVA standby facility against the
standby capacity of 550 MVA.
6.The MSEB issued notice on 28.6.1996 revising its tariff to TPC
effective from 1.10.1996.   The MSEB raised its maximum demand
charges   per   month   with   respect   of   standby   facility/supply   from
Rs.190/­ per KVA to Rs.450/­ per KVA.   Consequently, MSEB gave
notice to TPC,  inter alia, revising its standby charges with effect from
1.10.1996 recoverable from TPC to Rs.24.75 crores per month i.e.,
Rs.297 crores per year.
7.TPC had issued a notice on 30.7.1996 to the Government of
Maharashtra and MSEB under Schedule VI to the Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948, showing its intention to enhance tariff charges with effect
from 1.10.1996 which included maximum demand charges and energy
charges   to   various   consumers.     It   also   provided   for   payment   of
maximum demand charges and energy charges by BSES for standby
facility.  With effect from 1.1.1997, TPC revised its tariff  inter alia to
BSES, thereby factoring in the monthly demand charges of Rs.24.75
crores payable by TPC to MSEB for standby supply.   In order to
resolve the issue of quantum of standby charges to be paid by BSES to
TPC, the Government of Maharashtra appointed a Committee and an6
order   dated   19.1.1998   was   passed   whereby   the   Government   of
Maharashtra,   based   on   the   recommendation   of   the   Committee,
stipulated that a sum of Rs.3.5 crores per month should be paid by
BSES/REL to TPC by way of standby facility for the period 1998­1999.
This sum of Rs.3.5 crores per month i.e., Rs.42 crores per annum was
over and above the sum Rs.24.75 crores per month i.e., Rs.297 crores
per annum which TPC used to recover in the form of its tariff from its
customer.  In fixing the aforesaid amount, the following factors were
taken into consideration by the said Committee:
“(i)  the generation of TPC and MSEB;
(ii)the electricity supplied by TPC on BSES/ REL as a consumer.
(iii)TPC’s standby supply from MSEB;
(iv)Charges paid thereof by TPC;
(v)TPC’s and BSES/REL’s financial position;
(vi)That standby was being supplied for the stability of the Greater Mumbai
Grid.”
8.On 17.12.1997, TPC contended that it was fully capable and
willing to supply standby to BSES for its Dahanu plant and TPC
should, therefore, be billed only for 275 MVA standby facility for their
consumers other than BSES.  The Government of Maharashtra issued
an order on 19.1.1998, following is the relevant portion of the said
order:
  “it has come to the notice of the Government that due to
dispute   on   commercial   terms   between   BSES   and   TEC,
interconnection   is   not   established   at   Borivali   even   though
technical   arrangements   are   ready.   Similarly,   additional
electricity generated at Dahanu is being sold to the Western
Regional Grid through MSEB’s Biosar Interconnection.   As a
result,   the   government's   main   objective   that   electricity
generated at Dahanu should be used within the BSES area of7
supply  has   not   been   met   and   BSES   license   conditions   are
violated.   For   this   Government   had   appointed   a   Committee
under the Chairmanship of the Principal Secretary, Energy.  In
this committee, representatives of MSEB, TEC, and BSES were
members.   This Committee has examined the total situation
and has submitted its report to the Government.
GOM thereafter ordered as follows:
“Taking into account the recommendations of the Committee,
following are orders of the Government.
BSES should complete interconnection at Borivli by January
26, 1998.
BSES should take 275 MVA standby power supply from TEC
for Dahanu generating station.
For taking above standby supply, BSES should pay standby
charges to TEC.
After the interconnection is commissioned, BSES should stop
selling   electricity   through   MSEB’s   Boisar   sub­station   to
Western Regional Grid.
TEC   may   charge   stand­by   charges   for   275   MVA   supply   to
BSES.
Whenever required during an emergency, additional electricity
may   be   taken   for   areas   outside   Mumbai   region   through
MSEB's Boisar sub­station. For this purpose, MSEB should
take proper arrangements.
As per Committee’s recommendations and taking into account,
TEC’s electricity supply to BSES, TEC’s standby supply from
MSEB,   charges   thereof   and   TEC’s   and   BSES’s   financial
conditions, BSES should make a payment of Rs.3.5 crores
every month for standby supply.  On this basis, the rate per
KVA should be fixed and commercial arrangement finalized. 
The above standby charges are passed on TEC’s & BSES’s
existing electricity supply tariff.  The standby charges may
be reviewed during tariff revision in the future.”
9. Since the agreement was to be finalised as per the Government’s
order, the Government had no power to give directions to generators
and   distributors,   TPC   and   BSES   had   entered   into   Principles   of
Agreement on 30.1.1998, the clauses 2 to 9 are extracted hereunder:
 “(2) BSES shall pay to TEC for the 220 KV interconnection at
Borivali Rs.3.5 crores per month as standby charges for 275
MVA as per Government orders.
(3) BSES offtake of energy at 220 KV Borivli interconnection
will be billed at Rs.2.09 per kWh plus F.A.C. (which is presently
at Rs.0.45) as applicable from time to time at other points of8
supply.  This average energy charge is based on an estimated
annual   flow   of   250   million   units   of   energy   through   Borivli
interconnection.
(5) As soon as the interconnection between TEC and BSES at
220 KV Borivli is established.
(6) The interconnection between MSEB and BSES at Boisar will
be opened out.
(7) BSES shall use this interconnection at Borivali fully for the
standby type of service.
(8) Both the parties have agreed to cooperate in order to ensure
that   the   orders   of   the   Government   dated   19­01­1998   are
implemented in the spirit of it.
(9)  A detailed Power Supply Agreement on a mutually agreed
basis incorporating the above will be executed by 21   st   of April,
1998.”
(emphasis supplied)
Though the aforesaid principles of the agreement were entered
into between the parties, for one reason or the other, no agreement
has been executed between them.  
10.  The TPC under the Principles of Agreement dated 31.1.1998 was
bound to supply standby power as and when required by BSES/REL.
Whether the TPC was drawing from MSEB or not is immaterial.  The
agreement of BSES was with TPC, not with MSEB.   The agreement
between TPC and BSES was independent than the agreement between
TPC and MSEB.
11.Even   after   providing   the   standby   facility   of   275   MVA   to
BSES/REL, TPC still enjoyed the standby facility of   550 MVA from
MSEB.  The TPC entitlement to avail 550 MVA standby facility from
MSEB did not change.
12.The   standby   facility   that   has   been   availed   of   by   BSES/REL9
through TPC since then it actually drew on about 119 occasions till
May 2004, of which 57 occasions in excess of 275 MVA.  It has been
observed by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (in short ‘the APTEL’)
that TPC in 90 percent of the above occurrences has supplied standby
powers from its own generation and never drawn back the power from
MSEB.  The TPC has actually drawn standby from MSEB on a large
number of occasions and on several occasions far in excess of 275
MVA.  The standby drawn by TPC from MSEB is as under:
 “439 MVA highest in 1998­1999
271 MVA highest in 1999­2000
358 MVA highest in 2000­2001
325 MVA highest in 2002­2003
415 MVA highest in 2002­2003
763 MW highest in 2004”
13.It is also pertinent to mention that even after BSES/REL started
drawing   power   from   its   Dahanu   generation   station,   BSES/REL
continued to purchase approximately 35 percent of TPC's generation
from TPC to supply energy to BSES/REL consumers.  With effect from
1.2.1998, the BSES/REL paid a sum of Rs.3.5 crores per month to
TPC as charges for standby.  The TPC objected and sought the revision
of standby charges, which was fixed at Rs.3.5 crores per month, by
writing a letter to the Government of Maharashtra on 8.7.1998.  With
effect from 1.12.1998, the MSEB revised its tariff by issuing a notice
under the agreement between the MSEB and TPC.   The charges for10
standby facility were also increased from Rs.450 KVA per month to
Rs.550   KVA   per   month   i.e.,   Rs.363   crores   per   annum   equal   to
Rs.30.250 crores per month.  These standby charges enhanced from
Rs.24.75 crore per month to Rs.30.25 crores per month with effect
from 1.12.1998 i.e., from Rs.297 crores to Rs.363 crores annually.
The   TPC  instead   of  requiring  a   pro­rata   share  of   the  incremental
standby charges from BSES/REL purported to divide the amount of
Rs.30.25   crores   in   the   ratio   of   50:50   and   demanded   a   sum   of
Rs.15.125 crores per month i.e., Rs.181.5 crores per annum by way of
standby charges from BSES/REL.   The TPC was already recovering
Rs.24.75 crores per month through its tariff as said amount was
factored in tariff from its customers and additional recovery of Rs.3.5
crores was also being made from BSES/REL under the Principles of
Agreement.  Thus, the total recovery of Rs.28.25 crores per month by
way of standby charge was already made by TPC from its customers as
on September 1998.   By demanding a sum of Rs.15.125 crores per
month from BSES/REL, TPC was attempting to demand an additional
sum of approximately Rs.11.625 crores per month from BSES/REL
under the guise of standby charges instead of demanding a pro­rata
amount of the incremental standby charges of Rs.2 crores.
14.TPC issued notice dated 30.9.1998 under Schedule VI to the11
Electricity   (Supply)   Act,   1948   to   the   Government   of   Maharashtra
proposing revision of its tariff and other matters.  It was indicated in
the notice that it would pay only Rs.181.5 crores per annum and
remaining should be the liability of BSES/REL.   It has also been
contended on behalf of TPC that other revision in tariff had not been
proposed by TPC which would otherwise have needed an increase of 6
percent on all consumers in Mumbai.  It served a notice on BSES/REL
demanding   the   aforesaid   charges   of   35   percent   of   the   component
which was purchased by BSES/REL as a consumer.   The standby
charges   used   to   be   paid   and   otherwise   included   in   the   tariff.
BSES/REL has received 35 percent of the energy supplied from TPC
as a consumer and for the same, TPC was recovering an amount of
Rs.24.75 crores per month and an additional sum of Rs.3.5 crores per
month.  This Court in  BSES Ltd. v. Tata Power Co. Ltd.,  (2004) 1 SCC
195 has observed that tariff notice as being illegal.  Since the dispute
between the TPC and BSES/REL could not be sorted out, an order
dated   22.3.2000   was   passed   by   the   Government   of   Maharashtra
endorsing the Committee’s Report.  Vide aforesaid order, BSES/REL
was directed to pay Rs.9 crores as observed in   BSES Ltd. v. Tata
Power Co. Ltd.  (supra) by this Court.
15.The Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998 (in short ‘the12
Act of 1998’) came to be promulgated which conferred jurisdiction on
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (in short ‘the MERC’)
to determine the tariff of supply of electricity and later on to adjudicate
the dispute between the parties.  The dispute came to be referred to
MERC by the parties.  The order dated 22.3.2000 passed by the State
Government has been set aside by the High Court, which decision has
been  affirmed  by this  Court in   BSES   Ltd.   v.   Tata   Power   Co.   Ltd.
(supra).  
16.The MERC passed an order on 7.12.2001 directing BSES/REL to
bear 25 percent of the standby charges.  This order was challenged by
both the parties before the High Court.  The High Court remitted the
matter back to MERC and directed BSES/REL to deposit 50 percent of
the standby amount as an interim arrangement.   The matter had
further travelled to this Court in the aforesaid decision namely  BSES
Ltd. v. Tata Power Co. Ltd.  (supra).
17.After the matter was remitted, MERC after hearing the parties
passed an order dated 31.5.2004 and directed the BSES/REL to bear
approximately 23 percent of the total standby charges incurred by TPC
qua MSEB.  While noticing that TPC has already recovered a sum of
Rs.24.75 crores per month through its tariff and an additional sum of
Rs.3.5 crores per month as per the Principles of Agreement, it was13
found that large part of standby charges has already been recovered
by TPC through tariffs and otherwise.  Against the demand made on
31.5.2004, both the parties filed an appeal before the APTEL.  It was
heard by a Bench consisting of Chairman and Technical Member.
They   delivered   separate   judgments,   both   of   them   rejected   the
contentions of TPC claiming standby charges in the ratio of 50:50.
The Chairman opined that standby charges should be shared in the
proportion of 2:1 i.e., TPC paying 2/3rd and BSES/REL paying 1/3rd,
while Technical Member held BSES/REL should bear 23 percent while
TPC should bear approximately 77 percent.
18.In view of the divergence of opinion, the matter was referred to
the   third   Member   being   Judicial   Member,   who   agreed   with   the
conclusion of the Technical Member that BSES/REL should bear 23
percent of the standby charges.  In view of the majority judgment, the
APTEL passed an order dated 20.12.2006, acknowledging the majority
view of the Judicial Member and the Technical Member and directed
that 23 percent of the standby charges for the period in question
should be borne by BSES/REL and balance should be borne by TPC
and further directed refund of the excess amount that was deposited
by BSES/REL pursuant to the interim orders passed.  The MERC in
the   appeal   has   acknowledged   that   TPC   has   withdrawn   a   sum   of14
Rs.24.75 crores from its customers through electricity tariff and an
additional sum of Rs.3.5 crores per month by way of standby charges
from   BSES/REL   did   not   give   credit   for   the   said   sum   in   the
computation of standby charges to the extent of 23 percent held to be
payable by BSES/REL.   The appeal of BSES/REL in respect of the
aforesaid was rejected by the APTEL vide judgment and order dated
20.4.2007.  TPC filed Civil Appeal No.415 of 2007 before this Court.
BSES/REL has also filed Civil Appeal No.3229 of 2007 aggrieved by
the judgment and order dated 20.4.2007 of APTEL.
19.Shri Gopal Jain learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
TPC has contended that TPC has not recovered standby charges from
its customers for the facility in excess of 275 MVA out of 550 MVA
standby facility for the period April 1999 to March 2004 provided by
MSEB.   Thereafter as provided by tariff order dated 11.6.2004, TPC
has recovered from its customers to the extent of 78 percent of the
standby charges.    This Court has granted interim stay on 7.2.2007
and required the appellant to furnish bank guarantee in the sum of
Rs.227 crores and in addition, deposit a sum of Rs.227 crores with the
Registrar   General   of   this   Court,   which   may   be   withdrawn   by
respondent no.1 subject to their furnishing an undertaking to this
Court that in the event of this appeal being decided against them, the15
amount   as   may   be   found   refundable   by   them   shall   be   refunded
without demur with interest as may be determined by this Court.  The
TPC has complied with these conditions and it is not correct to say
that   all   concerned   have   complied   with   the   impugned   order   dated
20.12.2006.  The amount of Rs.3.5 crores per month was only for the
year 1997­1998, though the actual liability came to be Rs.8.25 crores
per month, Rs.3.5 crores were fixed so as to avoid disturbance in the
tariff in the current year.  The MSEB is not providing standby facility
of   1777   MW   (TPC’s   total   installed   capacity)   nor   is   REL   provided
standby facility of 550 MVA by TPC.  Therefore, the standby charges
cannot be apportioned in the ratio of the total installed capacity of TPC
and REL.   The obligation to pay to MSEB for the standby facility is
independent.  If the generator for some reason is not able to recover
from its customers, it will not be absolved of its obligation to pay the
standby charges to MSEB.  The liability of the BSES/REL to pay for
standby charges in 50:50 ratio is absolute and cannot be linked with
the means of recovery.   It would result in disturbing and distorting
level playing field conditions which are a facet of Article 14 of the
Constitution and also distort competition.  It is also urged by learned
senior counsel that it would run contrary to the objects of the Act of
1998, in particular, the mandate of Section 29(3) which is extracted16
hereunder:
“29. Determination of Tariff by State Commission.
(3) The State Commission, while determining the tariff under this
Act,   shall   not   show   undue   preference   to   any   consumer   of
electricity, but may differentiate according to the consumer’s load
factor,   power   factor,   total   consumption   of   energy   during   any
specified period or the time at which the supply is required or the
geographical position of any area, the nature of supply and the
purpose for which the supply is required.”
20.It was further urged that the prayer was made by BSES/REL
before the MERC to fix the standby charges payable by BSES/REL
(complainant) to the TPC (respondents).   Its liability would be more
than Rs.3.5 crores per month.       TPC is paying Rs.363 crores as
standby charges to MSEB.  On principles of parity and proportionality,
the BSES/REL should pay for 275 MVA as the quantum of 275 MVA
standby is out of the same block of 550 MVA standby facility given by
MSEB.  The TPC and BSES/REL should share in the ratio of 50:50.
The APTEL has not followed the decision of this Court in  BSES Ltd. v.
Tata Power Co. Ltd.  (supra).  This Court in the aforesaid decision has
observed as under:
“16.  The word “tariff” has not been defined in the Act. “Tariff” is a cartel of
commerce and normally it is a book of rates. It will mean a schedule of
standard prices or charges provided to the category or categories of customers
specified in the tariff. Sub­section (1) of Section 22 clearly lays down that the
State Commission shall determine the tariff for electricity (wholesale, bulk, grid
or retail) and also for use of transmission facilities. It has also the power to
regulate power purchase of the distribution utilities including the price at
which   the   power   shall   be   procured   from   the   generating   companies   for
transmission, sale, distribution, and supply in the State. ""Utility"" has been
defined in Section 2(l) of the Act and it means any person or entity engaged in
the generation, transmission, sale, distribution or supply, as the case may be,
of energy. Section 29 lays down that the tariff for the intra­State transmission
of electricity and tariff for supply of electricity — wholesale, bulk or retail — in
a State shall be subject to the provisions of the Act and the tariff shall be
determined by the State Commission. Sub­section (2) of Section 29 shows that17
the terms and conditions for fixation of the tariff shall be determined by
Regulations and while doing so, the Commission shall be guided by the factors
enumerated in clauses ( a) to (g) thereof. The Regulations referred to earlier
show   that   generating   companies   and   utilities   have   to   first   approach   the
Commission for approval of their tariff whether for generation, transmission,
distribution or supply and also for terms and conditions of supply. They can
charge from their customers only such tariff which has been approved by the
Commission.   Charging   of   a   tariff   which   has   not   been   approved   by   the
Commission is an offence which is punishable under Section 45 of the Act. The
provisions of the Act and Regulations show that the Commission has the
exclusive power to determine the tariff. The tariff approved by the Commission
is final and binding and it is not permissible for the licensee, utility or anyone
else to charge a different tariff.
*** *** ***
“18. Electricity is not a commodity which may be stored or kept in
reserve.   It   has   to   be   continuously   generated   and   it   is   so
continuously   generated   electricity   which   is   made   available   to
consumers.   Any   generator   of   electricity   has   to   have   some
alternate   arrangement   to   fall   back   upon   in   the   event   of   its
generating machinery coming to a halt. The standby arrangement
for 550 MVA made by TPC was for the purpose that in the event
its   generation   fell   short   for   any   reason,   it   will   be   able   to
immediately draw the aforesaid quantity of power from MSEB.
Similarly,   the   arrangement   entered   into   by   BSES   with   TPC
ensured the former of immediate availability of 275 MVA power in
the   event   of   any   breakdown   or   stoppage   of   generation   in   its
Dahanu   generation   facility.   Heavy   investment   is   required   for
generation of power. For this kind of a guarantee and availability
of power, TPC had to pay charges for the same to MSEB. This
payment was in addition to the charges or price which TPC had to
pay to MSEB for the actual draw of electrical energy.  The same is
the case with BSES qua TPC.  The charges paid for this kind of an
arrangement whereby a fixed quantity of electrical energy was
guaranteed   to   TPC   and   BSES   at   their   desire,   is   bound   to
constitute a component of the price which they (BSES and TPC)
would be charging from their consumers towards the cost of the
electrical energy actually consumed by them . The determination
or quantification of the amount which is payable for this kind of
standby arrangement made in favour of TPC and BSES would, in
reality, mean determination of the price or charges for wholesale
or bulk supply of electricity. It will, therefore, clearly fall within
the   expression   ""determine   the   tariff   for   electricity,   wholesale,
bulk, grid or retail"" as used in clause ( a) of sub­section (1) of
Section 22 and also in the expression “regulate power purchase …
including the price at which the power shall be procured from the
generating companies …” as used in clause ( c) of sub­section (1)
of Section 22.   Therefore, the determination or quantification of
the   amount   which   BSES   has   to   pay   to   TPC   falls   within   the
jurisdiction of the State Commission under Section 22 of the Act .
This legal position is also reflected by Section 29 of the Act which18
confers   an   overriding   power   and   clearly   lays   down   that
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the tariff for
supply of electricity — wholesale, bulk or retail — shall be subject
to the provisions of the Act and shall be determined by the State
Commission.   This   clearly   ousts   the   jurisdiction   of   any   other
authority to determine the tariff. It may be noted here that the Act
came into force on 25­4­1998 and the Maharashtra Electricity
Regulatory Commission was formed on 5­8­1999. Therefore,  it is
not possible to accept the contention of Shri Nariman that the
State Government had the authority or jurisdiction on 22­3­2000
to determine or quantify the charges which BSES had to pay to
TPC under the terms of the licence granted to the former as this
was subsequent to the formation of the Maharashtra Electricity
Regulatory Commission .”
19.   Shri   Nariman   has   submitted   that   TPC   gave   a   notice   on
30­9­1998 of their intention to enhance the charges of standby
facility provided to BSES from Rs 3.5 crores to Rs 15.125 crores
per month and this notice having been given under the Sixth
Schedule (para I, third proviso) of the Electricity (Supply) Act,
1948, the enhanced charges became effective and operative after
the expiry of 60 days of notice i.e. with effect from 1­2­1998. The
submission is that by operation of law the charges for standby
facility stood revised and enhanced with effect from 1­12­1998. In
our opinion, the contention raised has no substance. The legal
position has undergone a complete change with the enforcement
of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. In view of
Section 29 of the Act, the tariff for intra­State transmission of
electricity and tariff for supply of electricity in wholesale, bulk or
retail   has   to   be   determined   by   the   Electricity   Regulatory
Commission of the State and a licensee cannot by its unilateral
action enhance the charges. The provisions of the Act have an
overriding effect by virtue of Section 52 of the Act and, therefore,
any provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which are
inconsistent with the Act would cease to apply and consequently,
the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the said Act can have no
application now. The Sixth Schedule has been made by virtue of
Sections 57 and 57­A of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and
Section 57­A contemplates constitution of a Rating Committee by
the State Government to examine the licensee’s charges for the
supply of electricity. Section 29(6) of the Act specifically lays down
that notwithstanding anything contained in Sections 57­A and
57­B of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, no Rating Committee
shall be constituted after the date of the commencement of the
Act.   The   effect   of   Section   29   and   the   Regulations   framed
thereunder is that it is no longer open to a licensee or utility to
unilaterally increase the tariff. The tariff can be enhanced only
after approval of the Commission and charging of an enhanced
tariff   which   has   not   been   approved   by   the   Commission   will19
amount to commission of an offence.   Therefore, the notice to
enhance the charges given by TPC, which was subsequent to the
enforcement of the Act, can have no legal effect.
20. Shri Nariman has also submitted that even assuming that the
standby charges are a matter relating to tariff as the same is
passed on to the consumers, but the sharing of standby charges
between TPC and BSES is not a matter relating to determination
of tariff and, therefore, the Commission can have no jurisdiction
to enter into such an exercise under Section 22 of the Act. The
submission proceeds on an assumption that the dispute relates
to the sharing of standby charges. In fact, the whole case of BSES
is that they are under no obligation to share the charges which
are being paid by TPC to MSEB for providing them with standby
facility. It may be noted that the standby facility of 300 MVA was
provided to TPC in the year 1985 which gradually rose to 550
MVA in the year 1990. The licence of BSES was amended in
1992, whereunder for the first time, it was provided that they
should interlink with the system of TPC and ultimately, their
systems were interlinked on 14­2­1998 in pursuance of the order
passed by the Government of Maharashtra on 19­1­1998. The
question of payment of standby charges by BSES to TPC has,
therefore, arisen for the first time in 1998 which is almost 13
years   after   TPC   started   paying   standby   charges   to   MSEB.   In
substance, the dispute is what should be paid by BSES to TPC for
the   standby   facility   provided   by   it.   The   strict   and   narrow
interpretation sought to be placed by the learned counsel so as to
oust the jurisdiction of the Commission cannot be accepted as it
will defeat the very object of enacting the Electricity Regulatory
Commissions Act.
*** *** ***
26. An interim arrangement is normally made on a prima facie
consideration   of   the   matter   and   on   broad   principles   without
examining the matter in depth. The matter has been remitted to
the Commission by the High Court by the judgment and order
dated 3­6­2003 and a period of nearly three­and­a­half months
has already elapsed. Regulation 101 of the Central Electricity
Regulatory   Commission   provides   that   the   Commission   may
normally dispose of  the  petitions  finally within  six months  of
admission. The State Commissions are also expected to follow
this time­limit for disposal of petitions.  Since the order made by
the High Court is only by way of interim arrangement and the
Commission is expected to decide the disputes finally within a
short period, we do not consider it proper to interfere with the
order made by the High Court in this regard. After the decision of
the Commission, the equities can be adjusted and the excess
amount   paid   by   any   party   can   be   refunded   to   it   along   with
appropriate interest or can be adjusted in future bills .”
(emphasis supplied)20
21.Learned  senior  counsel  has  also  urged  that   actual  supply  of
electricity and charges paid for actual supply are completely different
from   the   guarantee   and   charges   payable   for   providing   such   a
guarantee/arrangement.  It is further urged that generating capacity
comes at a cost.   The Technical Member therefore wrongly assigns
Zero cost for this generating capacity.  This is an error apparent in the
impugned order where the spinning reserve has been treated as zero
cost.
22.Learned senior counsel has relied on the decision in  Binani Zinc
Ltd. v. Kerala State Electricity Board,  (2009) 11 SCC 244, to contend
that notice dated 30.9.1998 was legal and valid.  The relevant portion
of the aforesaid decision is extracted hereunder:
 “28.  Thus, it would be one thing to say that upon coming into force of the
1998 Act the provisions contained in the 1948 Act which are found to be
inconsistent with the former shall give way thereto but it is another thing to
say that although no Commission is constituted, the Board would have no
jurisdiction at all to frame a tariff.
*** *** ***
33. It is of some significance to note that the Commission in terms of clauses
(a) and (b) of sub­section (2) of Section 29 of the 1998 Act are required to follow
the principles provided for under Sections 46, 56 and 57­A of the 1948 Act as
also the Sixth Schedule appended thereto. The 1998 Act, therefore, recognises
the principles contained in the 1948 Act also.
*** *** ***
41. We have, however, no hesitation in finding that the State Electricity Board
had the requisite jurisdiction to revise a tariff till such time as the Commission
was constituted and the purposes of the 1998 Act could be achieved through
it. Till the time the Regulatory Commission was not constituted by the State of
Kerala, the  power to  determine tariff  remained with  the Board  under the
Electricity   (Supply)   Act,   1948   as   it   was   not   repealed   by   the   Electricity
Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. Parliament could not have intended to
bring about a situation where no authority would be empowered to determine
the tariff between the date of coming into force of the ERC Act, 1998 and the
constitution of the Commission. It is only after the Regulatory Commission is
constituted that it will be the sole authority to determine the tariff.”21
No case for interference in Civil Appeal No. 3229 of 20017 is
made out which is barred by limitation.
23.Shri J.J. Bhatt learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
BSES/REL   has   contended   that   TPC   and   MSEB   entered   into   an
arrangement on 12.3.1985.   There was an independent agreement
between TPC and BSES/REL entered into on 31.1.1998 and it has no
connection   with   the   agreement   between   the   TPC   and   MSEB.
Notwithstanding the fact that MSEB supplied TPC with standby power
or not, TPC was bound to supply BSES/REL from its own generation
standby   power.     On   approximately   90   percent   of   the   occasions,
BSES/REL has utilised standby power of TPC.   It has exceeded on
some occasions more than 275 MVA and has gone up to above 400
MVA, whereas TPC has drawn standby from MSEB.   The Government
passed   an   order   on   19.1.1998,   considering   several   factors   and
determined   Rs.3.5   crores   per   month   as   standby   charges.     The
payment of standby charges by BSES/REL to TPC was independent of
the charges to be paid by TPC to MESB.  The determination has been
made on the basis of various factors.  Basis of 50:50 sharing has been
rightly rejected by the MERC as well as by the APTEL.   The decision of
spinning reserve by the Technical and Judicial Members at zero levels
is justified in the facts of the case.  The submission made on the basis22
of  Binani   Zinc   Ltd.   v.   Kerala   State   Electricity   Board   (supra)   is   not
tenable.  The total generating capacity of TPC was 1777 MW, whereas
that of BSES/REL is 500 MW.  It is incorrect that TPC has recovered
only 50 percent of standby charges payable to MSEB.   The standby
charges of Rs.24.75 crores per month i.e., Rs.297 crores per annum
were factored into TPC tariff in addition to the amount of Rs.3.5 crores
per month was paid by BSES/REL.  It wanted to realise 75 percent of
the charges from BSES/REL by claiming a 50:50 ratio sharing.  The
TPC has spinning reserve surplus of 317 MVA with regard to its total
capacity of 1777 MW.  It was not MSEB but TPC which has provided
standby support to BSES/REL on 90 percent occasions.  It is further
contended that the appeal filed by BSES/REL should be allowed and
the excess amount has been worked out by the APTEL.  The same may
be suitably reduced.
24.The period in dispute is 1.4.1999 to 30.9.2004.   It is apparent
that TPC has an agreement with MSEB for standby supply of 550
MVA.   Initially, in 1985, TPC has increased its generating capacity
whereby reducing the off­take of electricity from MSEB to zero.   In
order to compensate MSEB for loss of revenue caused as a result of
the stoppage of purchase of electricity, the MSEB entered into an
arrangement with TPC whereby TPC was required to pay to MSEB23
initially for 300 MVA standby to be increased by 50 MVA every year.
The standby was freeze in the year 1990 when the parties agreed not
to increase the standby beyond 550 MVA.
25.The standby facility was made available to TPC in the event there
was a failure of power in TPC’s generation of 1777 MW.  BSES/REL
used   to   purchase   electricity   from   TPC   between   29   percent   to   37
percent   from   1998   to   2006.     The   standby   charges   for   aforesaid
purchase   were   factored   into   the   tariff   charged   from   its   retail
customers.  The standby charges to the extent of supply were borne by
BSES/REL for optimum supply from TPC when interconnectivity was
provided at Borivali point as per the Government order.  The dispute
arose   between   TPC   and   BSES/REL   as   to   whether   BSES/REL
entitlement to draw 275 MVA from TPC in the case of outage and
failure of electricity supply, the charges which were required to be paid
were   over   and   above   the   charges   that   would   be   paid   for   energy
actually drawn.  At the relevant time, TPC was paying an amount of
Rs.24.75 crores per month i.e., Rs.297 crores per annum to MSEB by
way of standby charges which was built into the tariff.   The said
amount   was   recovered   by   TPC   from   its   customers   who   in   turn
recovered it from their retail consumers.24
26.The Government of Maharashtra formed a Committee to resolve
the   issue   of   quantum   of   standby   charges   required   to   be   paid   by
BSES/REL to TPC.  The Government of Maharashtra passed an order
dated   19.1.1998   whereby   stipulating   a   sum   of   Rs.3.5   crores   per
month   should   be   paid   by   BSES/REL   to   TPC   by   way   of   standby
charges.     The   decision   was   taken   by   the   Committee   inter   alia
considering the generation by TPC and MSEB.  The order was based
upon six factors ­ generation of TPC and MSEB; electricity supplied by
TPC to BSES/REL as a consumer; TPC’s standby supply from MSEB;
charges   paid   for   said   sub­standby   supply   by   TPC   to   MSEB;   the
financial   position   of   TPC   and   BSES/REL;   and   stability   of   better
Mumbai grid.
27.The main principles on the basis of which Agreement was to be
reached between TPC and BSES/REL were settled.  As per clause 2 of
the Principles of Agreement, BSES/REL had to pay to TPC for 220 KV
interconnection at Borivali at Rs.3.5 crores per month.   The parties
had agreed to cooperate in order to ensure that Government order
dated 19.1.1998 is implemented in the spirit of it.  A detailed power
supply   agreement   was   to   be   entered   into   by   21.4.1998.         The
agreement could not be executed as consensus with respect to several25
aspects could not be reached.  The order dated 22.3.2000 has been set
aside by the High Court, which order was not interfered with by this
Court and the case was remitted for the decision to MERC, which is
an   expert   body.     The   power   was   conferred   upon   the   MERC   vide
notification dated 27.10.2000 under the provision of Section 22(2)(n)
of Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998, to adjudicate upon
the   disputes   and   differences   between   licensees   and   utilities.     On
4.12.2000, BSES/REL had filed an application to MERC in respect of
sharing of standby charges between BSES/REL and TPC.  The prayers
were made to regulate action and standby charges levied by them and
to fix and determine the standby charges payable by them.
28.Ultimately, the APTEL by the impugned orders has decided the
matter.  The Chairman has held that liability to be in proportion of 2:1
tariff, whereas Judicial  Member has  concurred with  the  Technical
Member   when   Technical   Member   differed   with   the   opinion   of
Chairman, but the fact remains that MERC, as well as the APTEL,
concurrently have not accepted the case of the TPC that standby
charges should be borne in ratio of 50:50.  The decisions of MERC, as
well as the Technical and Judicial Members, are found to be correct
while  terming  ratio  as  23:77 with  respect to  BSES/REL  and TPC
respectively.26
29.In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and,
in   particular,   several   factors   were   required   to   be   taken   into
consideration, on that basis aforesaid figure has been worked out.  It
has also been considered that electricity used to be purchased by
BSES/REL from TPC to the aforesaid extent and the standby charges
used to be realised which were factored in the tariff, which liability
was ultimately passed on to the retail consumers.   Even when the
Principles of Agreement have been reached as to standby charges
though it was subject to revision basis was fixed which could not have
been departed from, it was on consideration of several aspects.  The
ratio had been appropriately worked out in the most equitable manner
by applying the level playing field.  Considering the standby charges of
Rs.24.75   crores   recovered   by   MSEB   from   TPC   with   effect   from
1.10.1996   and   as   per   the   Government   order   and   Principles   of
Agreement   Rs.3.5   crores   was   additionally   being   available   and   a
difference   of   standby   which   was   made   to   increase   the   liability
Rs.24.75 crore per month to Rs.30.25 crores per month.   Thus, the
decision   of   the   Technical   and   Judicial   Members   is   found   to   be
appropriate and reasonable while working out the percentage of the27
standby charges to be paid by BSES/REL to TPC for the period in
question.
30.This Court in  BSES Ltd. v. Tata Power Co. Ltd.  (supra) held that
the tariff notice dated 30.9.1998 to be illegal and had no legal effect.
It   was   held   that   the   charges   paid   for   this   kind   of   arrangement,
whereby a fixed quantity of electrical energy was guaranteed to TPC
and BSES/REL at their desire, is bound to constitute a component of
the price which they (BSES and TPC) would be charging from their
consumers towards the cost of the electrical energy actually consumed
by them.   This Court also held that the State Government had no
authority or jurisdiction on 22.3.2000 to determine or quantify the
charges which BSES had to pay to TPC under the terms of the license
granted to the former.   It was further observed that Commission to
decide the dispute early.   A clarificatory order was passed by this
Court on 9.1.2004 considering the decision in   Binani Zinc Limited
(supra).  The petition was filed by TPC for review.  On the basis of the
decision in Binani Zinc Limited (supra),  the same was dismissed.  The
MERC has passed the order on 31.5.2004, the following observations
were made by MERC: 
  ""94.   In this context, the Commission is also of the view that,
since the standby facility ensures the reliability of the Mumbai
system and thus benefits all the consumers in the Mumbai area,
they have to contribute towards the cost of standby through the
mechanism   designed   by   the   Commission.     TPC   has   been28
recovering the cost of standby that was applicable in January
1998 i.e., Rs.24.75 crore per month, from its consumers through
its tariff, viz. fixed charges and energy charges.  This aspect has
been   dealt   with   in   detail   subsequently   in   this   Order.     Now,
depending on the ratio of sharing of the standby cost determined
by the Commission, the consumers of TPC and BSES will have to
pay   the   cost   applicable   to   their   respective   licensees,   in   the
manner decided by the Commission.
*** *** ***
225.  The Commission is, however, of the view that the issue of
whether  the ratio should  be applicable  on  the entire standby
component or only on the incremental portion above Rs.24.75
crore, and the recovery of the same from the consumers, is a
matter of tariff, which is within the Commission’s jurisdiction as
held by several   Courts, including the High Court judgment on
the appeal filed by TPC and BSES on the Commission’s Order in
the matter of sharing of standby charges.
*** *** ***
237.  While determining the Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR)
of   TPC   in   the   separate   case   before   it,   the   Commission   is
considering all the payments to be made to or by the respective
Parties and the interest and delayed payment charges, and is
restating the Clear Profit of BSES and TPC to reflect the true
picture, in line with the Commission’s decision on the issue of
sharing of standby charges.  This is being done from FY 1998­99,
as the dispute arose during that year.   The Commission has
drawn   from   the   available   reserves   and   surpluses,   wherever
required, to ensure that TPC and BSES get their due Reasonable
Return on a year­on­year basis, in line with the provisions of
Schedule VI.  Having ensured that the Clear Profit matches the
Reasonable   Return   on   a   year­on­year   basis,   there   is   no
requirement for any additional recovery of any amount from the
Parties.  The Utilities have to draw from their reserves, as would
be   elaborated   by   the   Commission,   to   make   the   payments   as
directed by it.
*** *** ***
239.Para 26 of the Supreme Court ruling states, inter alia, that
“After   the   decision   of   the   Commission,   the   equities   can   be
adjusted   and   the   excess   amount   paid   by   any   party   can   be
refunded to it along with appropriate interest or can be adjusted
in future bills.
240.   The Commission is of the view that interest should be
recovered from all parties to the dispute for the amounts paid
short   vis­ à­vis   the   actual   payments   due   from   each   party,   in
accordance   with   the   Commission’s   computations.     The
Commission believes that this approach is equitable to all the
Parties concerned, and is appropriate in the light of the issues
and circumstances of this matter which has been under dispute
for such a long time.  Hence, the Commission has computed the
interest payable by BSES to TPC for delayed payments in FY29
1998­99 and FY 1999­00, and the interest payable by TPC to
BSES on the excess amounts deposited by BSES with TPC for
onward payment to MSEB.  The Commission has considered the
fact that the interest rate on delayed payments to MSEB is 18%
for   overdue   over   6   months.     However,   in   this   instance,   the
payment   liabilities   as   between   TPC   and   BSES   have   been
crystallized   only   now   through   this   Order   of   the   Commission.
Moreover, the deposits made by BSES earlier were consequent to
Court Orders and were not regular payments.  Hence, taking into
account the prevailing market interest rates (SBI PLR) in each of
these years, the net (simple) interest payable by BSES works out
to Rs.8.37 crore, as shown in the table below, which can be
adjusted against the refund due to BSES from TPC.""
31.The MERC directed sharing of standby charges payable to MSEB
between TPC and BSES/REL on the basis of their respective peak load
requirements   and   directed   TPC   to   pay   to   BSES/REL   a   sum   of
Rs.315.30   crores   within   15   days.     It   was   also   observed   that   the
quantum of standby capacity is related  to the larger unit size of the
generation in either system.   We have no hesitation to accept the
majority opinion that standby facility provided by TPC was out of its
own generating capacity and 90 percent of the times energy has been
drawn by BSES/REL from TPC.  Thus, there is no justification for TPC
to claim 50:50 percent sharing of the standby charges in the facts of
this case on consideration of various factors the decision has been
reached.
32.It appears that there was no stay on the order passed by the
APTEL by this Court.   The plea of non­implementation of the order
taken by TPC is not understandable.  It was only the bank guarantee30
which was submitted by TPC, in addition, to deposit of a sum of
Rs.227   crores   with   the   Registrar   General   of   this   Court.     The
implementation   of   the   order   of   the   APTEL   would   mean   that   the
determination made by it has been acted upon and corresponding
liability factored into tariff has been passed on the customers and
actual consumers and realised from them since there was no such
interim stay on implementation of the order.   We find force in the
submission raised on behalf of BSES/REL that order of APTEL has
already been worked out even otherwise it is found to be just and
equitable.  No case for interference with the same is made out.
33.There   is   no   question   of   applicability   of   Article   14   of   the
Constitution.  As a matter of fact, what was agreed in the Principles of
Agreement more amount than that has been ordered to be paid on the
basis of principles of business equilibrium and other factors as noted
above.  
34.It may be relevant to mention here that I.A. No.59365 of 2019
and I.A. No. 59356 of 2019 have been filed for substitution of name of
Reliance Energy Limited with the agreement of learned counsel for the
parties, the name of Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited is substituted
as   respondent   and   as   appellant   in   C.A.   No.   415/2007   and   C.A.
No.3229/2007 respectively. 31
35.Resultantly, we find there is no case made out for interference in
either of the appeals filed by TPC and BSES/REL.  The order passed
by Technical and Judicial Members of APTEL is hereby upheld.  The
amount which is payable to Reliance Energy Limited, deposited or
secured   by   way   of   bank   guarantee   by   TPC   as   per   order   dated
07.02.2007 along with interest lying with the Registrar of this Court as
per agreement of the Counsel for Reliance Energy Limited and Adani
Electricity   Mumbai   Limited   be   paid   to   Adani   Electricity   Mumbai
Limited. The appeals being devoid of merits are hereby dismissed.
Consequently, IA Nos.59365/2019 & 59374/2019 in CA No.415/2007
and   IA   Nos.59356/2019   &   59380/2019   in   CA   No.3229/2007   are
disposed of. Any other IA, if any, also stands disposed of. No costs.

Rastogi, J.
1.The present appeals arise from the proceedings initiated by
the workers under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 who had been
in employment after issuance of the prohibition notification dated
17th  March   1993   under   the   Contract   Labour(Regulation   and
Abolition) Act, 1970(hereinafter being referred to as “CLRA Act”)
1upto April, 1996 in the captive mine of the Steel Authority of
India(hereinafter   called   as   “SAIL”)   in   Kuteshwar   Limestone
Mines(Barhi), Gairtalai, Distt. Jabalpur.
2.The indisputed facts which has come on record are that
after issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17th  March,
1993 by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the
CLRA Act,1970 no fresh agreement, in the interregnum period
(17th  March,   1993   to   April,   1996)   was   executed   between   the
appellant and the contract labour and the agreement in existence
was extended from time to time by the competent authority and
the contract labour was allowed to continue on the same terms &
conditions till their services were terminated by the contractor
after they had proceeded on strike in the month of April, 1996.
 
3.The   contract   labours   (2040   employees)   of   Kuteshwar
limestone mines who had worked in the establishment of SAIL
after issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17th  March,
1993 filed their claim applications in the year 1998 on different
dates under Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948. 
 
24.Before   we   advert   to   the   question   raised   in   the   instant
appeals, it may be relevant to take the brief history of the matter
for   proper   appreciation.     The   erstwhile   contract
labourers(respondents herein) worked at the captive Limestone
and Dolomite mines in the establishment of the appellant SAIL
initially   filed   writ   petitions   claiming   regularisation   with   back
wages in view of the law laid down by three Judge Bench of this
Court   in   the   case   of   Air India Statutory Corporation and

held that on issuance of prohibition notification under Section

would be that the erstwhile contract labourer covered by the
sweep of such abolition for the activities concerned would be
entitled   to   be   treated   as   direct   employee   of   the   employer   on
whose establishment they were earlier working and they would be
entitled to be treated as regular employees from the day on which
the contract labour system in the establishment for the work
which they were doing gets abolished.  The aforesaid judgment of

considered to be the lead application which has been placed on
record (Annexure P­1 of the paper book) and the only fact stated
by him in the application was that the applicant was employed in
the   Captive   Mine   of   the   SAIL   in   Kuteshwar   Limestone
Mines(Barhi), Gairtalai, Distt. Jabalpur on 1st  September, 1984

4the meaning of Section 2(e ) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948
and rates of wages of the workers of SAIL are governed by various
settlements/agreements entered into between the management
and the Union which are legally binding and are the wages to
which employees of SAIL are entitled on the basis of contract of
service, agreement and/or otherwise.
7.The   extract   pleadings   of   his   application  on   the   basis   of
which   he   claimed   wages   and   other   benefits   payable   to   an
employee vis­ à­vis those who are regular employee employed in
SAIL are as under:­
“1.The applicant is employed in the Captive Mine of the
Steel Authority of India (hereinafter called as SAIL’) in
Kuteshwar Limestone Mines (Barhi), Gairtalai, Distt.
Jabalpur from 01.09.1984 and is still in employment.
He   is   a   skilled   workman   and   is   working   as
Sikor/Loader/Suitor/Rake Loader.
6.The rates of wages of workers of Steel Authority of
India are governed by various settlements/Agreements
entered into between the management and the Union
which are legally binding and is the wages to which
employees of Steel Authority are entitled on the basis
of contract of services, agreement and or otherwise.
The Applicant is entitled to wages and all other benefits
as   per   settlement.   The   agreement   also   prohibit
employment of contract labour on job of permanent
and perennial nature.
7.The   management/opponent   has   been   reusing   to
make   payment   to   the   employees   as   per   wage
agreement   which   is   their   minimum   wages   Sri
5Bachchan   Nayak   and   other   office   bearers   of   the
Applicant’s Union repeatedly represented the matter of
the   Assistant   Labour   Commissioner,   Chief   Labour
Commissioner Secretary, Ministry of Labour, Hon’ble
Minister for Steel, Chairman, Steel Authority of India
and even the Prime Minister, for payment of wages as
regular   employees.   Because   of   the   strong   and
persistent opposition of one of the opponent, Minimum
Wages is denied to the Applicant.
12.The applicant has been reporting for work on
all   the   working   days   from   17/3/1993   onwards.
However, after May, 1996 he was refused work even
when the reports for duty. The applicant was always
ready and willing to work. There was no termination of
services of the applicant. The applicant will be deemed
to   be   in   service   and   entitled   to   all   the   benefits,
including wages.
16.The applicant has not been paid the wages as
per   Minimum   Wages   from   17/3/1993.   The   exact
figures of amount due i.e. difference etc. are available
with   the   management   and   within   their   special
knowledge. The opponents are in possession of all the
records and details of the payment due as per wage
agreement and other details. They are liable to produce
the   same   before   this   Hon’ble   Authority   to   make
appropriate and proper calculation. In case they fail to
produce the documents an adverse inference is liable
to be taken against them.
17.The applicant therefore pray that a direction
may be issued under Section 20 [3] of the Act for:
[i]payment of difference of wages payable
under   the   Minimum   Wages   Act   and   the
wages actually paid as per details given in
Annexure­A.
[ii]compensation   of   10   times   amounting   to
Rs. 24,86,130­00.
[iii]delay if any, in filing the petition may be
condoned.”
68.The complaint of the applicant Jaggu (annexure P­1) in his
application under Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948
before the prescribed authority of which a reference has been
made, appears to be that the rates of wages of SAIL which were
governed by various settlements/agreements entered between the
management and the registered Union of regular employees of
SAIL are legally enforceable and the applicant is also entitled to
the   wages   and   such   other   service   benefits   as   per   those
settlements after a prohibition notification has been published by
the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act.
9.The   matter   was   contested   between   the   parties   and   the
prescribed   authority   after   holding   a   summary   enquiry   as
contemplated under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 under its
Order dated 2nd December, 2003 allowed the claim petitions with
five times of compensation in favour of 2040 contract employees
who   have   been   represented   by   Ispat   Khadan   Janta   Mazdoor
Union, Koteshwar Limestone Mine, Gairtalai, Katni.  
10.The   order   of   the   Payment   of   Wages   Authority   dated   2nd
December, 2003 came to be challenged by the appellant SAIL by
7way of writ petition before the Single Judge of High Court of
Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur which was partly allowed vide Order
dated 24th January, 2006 holding that the justice would be met if
the   respondents(employees)   are   allowed   6%   interest   on   the
amount payable to each of them as compensation from the date
of passing of the impugned order of the authority till its payment.
It was further challenged before the Division Bench of the High
Court that came to be dismissed vide impugned judgment dated
11th December, 2006 with a modification that instead of grant of
6% interest as compensation, a consolidated sum of Rs. 5 crore
be paid towards compensation to the aggrieved employees, which
is a subject matter of challenge in these appeals before us.
11.Learned senior counsel for the appellants Mr. Ranjit Kumar
and Mr. Parag P. Tripathi submit that the parity of wages was
one of the issue nos. 5 & 6 based on the pleadings of the parties
framed   by   CGIT   pursuant   to   the   reference   made   by   the
appropriate   Government   and   both   the   issues   have   been
negatively answered under its award dated 16th September, 2009
holding   that   respondents   are   not   entitled   to   wages   as   per
National   Joint   Committee   for   the   Steel   Industries(NJCS)   vide
8memorandum   of   agreement   dated   30th  July,   1975   which   is
applicable only to direct/regular employees of SAIL.  
12.The submission of the learned counsel is that at least the
parallel   proceedings   which   are   summary   in   nature   initiated
under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 keeping the reference made
for   adjudication   to   the   CGIT   at   bay   were   unwarranted   and
despite their objection being raised, it was overruled and the
applications of the workmen came to be decided under Order
dated 2nd December, 2003 by the prescribed authority under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 which was without jurisdiction and
such applications filed at the instance of the workmen was not
maintainable under the law.
13.Learned counsel further submits that it is nowhere pleaded
by the respondents that the principle of equal pay for equal work
was applicable and they were entitled for the wages payable to
the regular employees on the basis of Rule 25(2)(v)(a) of the CLRA
Rules, 1971.   The burden to prove was on the respondents to
show that the contract labour was discharging the same and
similar nature of duties and work as performed by the regular
9employees   of   the   establishment   but   such   facts   were   neither
pleaded nor  established  by  the  respondents   either  before the
prescribed   authority   or   before   the   High   Court   in   writ
petition/letters patent appeal and has not adverted to any finding
that the respondents were performing same or similar nature of
work as that of the regular employees of the appellant SAIL.  In
the absence thereof, the contract labour was not entitled for the
wages payable to the employees who were directly employed by
the SAIL for a work which is neither same nor similar as being
performed by the respondent contract labourers.
14.Learned   counsel   further   submits   that   the   tripartite
agreement which was entered between the contract labourers,
contractor   and   appellant   SAIL   in   presence   of   the   labour
authorities dated 12th November, 1991 specifically takes care of
the Rule 25(2)(iv) & (v) of the CLRA Rules, 1971 and indisputedly,
each   of   the   worker   was   paid   Rs.   11.65/­   per   day   over   the
minimum   wages   notified   by   the   appropriate   Government,   as
agreed   between   the   parties.     The   tripartite   agreement   was
effective  from 1st  April  1991  although  it  was  entered  on  12th
10November, 1991 but wages were paid to each of the contract
worker in terms of the tripartite agreement.  
15.Learned counsel submits that it was never the case of the
respondents that the tripartite agreement dated 12th  November,
1991 has not been complied with.  In fact, the arrears were paid
over the minimum wages notified by the appropriate Government
in   terms   of   Rule   25(2)(v)(a)   of   the   CLRA   Rules,   1971   and
appellant became liable to pay the minimum wages agreed in
terms   of   the   agreement   after   issuance   of   the   prohibition
notification   under   Section   10(1)   of   the   CLRA   Act,   since   the
contract stood automatically extinct, it became the liability of the
employer to see that every workmen who is working thereafter
must have been paid his due wages in terms of the agreement
which   has   been   signed   in   presence   of   the   concerned   labour
authorities dated 12th  November, 1991 and binding upon the
parties.
16.Learned counsel for the appellants further submits that in
sequel to the notification dated 12th November, 1991, the Ministry
of Labour, Government of India, vide its notification dated 12th
11July, 1994 revised the minimum rate of wages payable to the
workers   employed   in   the   mines   appended   Clause   5   to   the
explanation   that   in   case   the   existing   rates   of   wages   of   any
employee as per agreement are more than the minimum notified
rates shall be protected and be treated as the minimum rates of
wages and that according to the appellants have been paid to
each of the workmen who had served the establishment of the
appellants after issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17th
March, 1993 till their services came to be terminated by the
contractor in April 1996.
17.Learned counsel further submits that the State of Madhya
Pradesh   under   its   Act   No.   23   of   1961   has   made   certain
amendments   to   the   Minimum   Wages   Act,   1948.     These
amendments as explained in its object and reasons was enacted
as validating legislation.   The validation arose in the context of
the High Court of Rajasthan quashing its notifications pertaining
to fixing of minimum rates of wages.  The said amendment Act is
merely to validate fixation and has no applicability to the dispute
having raised by the respondents in the proceedings initiated
under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and in support thereof,
12learned   counsel   has   placed   reliance   on   the   judgment   of   this
Court in Town Municipal Council, Athani  Vs. The Presiding
Officer,   Labour   Courts,   Hubli   and   Others,   Etc.   3;  BHEL
Workers   Association,   Hardwar   and   Others   Vs.  Union   of
India and Others   4 and Hindustan Steel Works Construction
Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Labour and Ors.   5.
18.Per contra, Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel for
the respondents in support of the judgment of the High Court
submits that after issuance of the prohibition notification dated
17th  March, 1993, it is an admitted position that the contract
labourers had continued to work in the same capacity in the
establishment of SAIL and that would make them entitled for the
wages which are being notified by the SAIL from time to time
payable   to   its   regular   employees   for   the   period   the   contract
labour had worked after the issuance of prohibition notification
dated   17th  March,   1993   till   April,   1996   and   clause(v)   of   the
notification prescribing minimum wages dated 6th  March, 1990
and 12th  July, 1994 clearly stipulates that the existing rate of
3 1969(1) SCC 873
4 1985(1) SCC 630
5 1996(10) SCC 599 .
13wages   to   any   employee   based   on   contract   or   agreement   or
otherwise if higher than the rates notified herein, the higher rate
shall be protected and be treated as rate of wages payable for the
purpose of its notification and once this fact has been admitted
that   there   was   an   agreement   entered   into   between   union   of
regular employees and the management of the establishment, at
least   the   lowest   rate   of   wages   in   the   establishment   of   the
appellant payable to a regular and permanent employee became
the benchmark of minimum wages payable to the contract labour
who had worked in the establishment of the appellant SAIL as an
employee after issuance of notification dated 17th  March, 1993
until   termination   of   service   and   this   what   the   prescribed
authority under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 has computed
towards arrears of each of the 2040 employee who have, inter
alia, filed applications for legitimate wages under the Minimum
Wages Act, 1948.
19.Learned   counsel   further   submits   that   as   regards   their
absorption and regularisation of service, it was indeed a subject
matter of adjudication in a reference made by the appropriate
Government   under   its   notification   dated   27th  January,   2003
14followed with 22nd February, 2005 but so far as their minimum
wages   payable   to   the   employees   are   concerned,   it   was   an
independent   issue   having   no   relationship   to   the   terms   of
reference pending before the CGIT at the relevant point of time
and after issuance of prohibition notification dated 17th   March,
1993 under CLRA Act, such of the contract workers who had
served thereafter in the establishment of the appellants became
their employee and can no longer be treated as contract workers.
20.Learned counsel submits that after the contract of service
agreement stands extinguished indisputedly the work discharged
by the employees(earlier contract workers) is same and similar as
of the regular employees and it is not open for the appellant to
have   two   different   wage   structures   for   the   employees   of   the
establishment of SAIL and it was indeed arbitrary and violative of
Article 14 & 39(d) of the Constitution of India and the wage
structure applicable to the employees of SAIL has rightly been
extended by the prescribed authority under the mandate of the
Minimum   Wages   Act,   1948   and   since   the   respondents   have
demanded lowest rate of wages in terms of settlements dated 6th
March, 1990 and 12th July, 1994, no further finding was required
15to be recorded with respect to the same or similar nature of work
being discharged and at least those rates of wages are applicable
to the present employees(earlier casual labourers) and this what
has   been   computed   by   the   prescribed   authority   under   the
Minimum Wages Act and confirmed by the High Court under the
impugned   judgment   and   in   support   of   submission,   learned
counsel has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in
BHEL Workers Association, Hardwar and Others (supra).
21.We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with
their assistance perused the material available on record.
22.To appreciate the rival submissions made by the respective
counsels, it is considered appropriate to first take note of the
indisputed facts and the scheme of the Minimum Wages Act,
1948   &   CLRA   Act   emerged   from   the   records   are   that   the
appellant SAIL is a Government of India Undertaking and is a
State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India
having   its   steel   plants   in   different   parts   of   India   and   was   a
registered establishment under Section 7 of the CLRA Act and the
contractor through whom the service of the contract labour was
16engaged was holding its licence as envisaged under Section 12 of
the CLRA Act.  The tripartite memorandum of settlement dated
12th November, 1991 which became effective from 1st April, 1991,
was   signed   by   the   appellant,   contractor   and   the   respondent
through   Union   before   the   Assistant   Labour   Commissioner
(Central), Jabalpur.   Under the said settlement, it was agreed
that the contract labour would be paid Rs. 11.65/­ per day over
and   above   the   minimum   wages   notified   by   the   appropriate
Government under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948.  Indisputedly,
each of the member of the union was paid his wages in terms of
the memorandum of settlement dated 12th November, 1991.  At
the later stage, the appropriate Government issued a prohibition
notification of employment of contract labour dated 17th March,
1993 and the fact remains that the contract labour which was
engaged   prior   to   the   prohibition   notification   was   allowed   to
continue in the establishment of the appellant(SAIL) on the same
terms and conditions with no change in their service conditions
under the agreement which was executed prior to the prohibition
notification dated 17th March, 1993, was extended from time to
time by the competent authority and the services of the contract
17labour came to be terminated by the respective contractor in the
month of April, 1996 after they went on strike.
23.After discontinuance of the service of the contract labour by
the   respective   contractor   in   April,   1996,   2040
employees/contract   labour   through   their   union   filed   their
respective applications in the year 1998 under Section 20(1) of
the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 before the prescribed authority to
claim parity with the wages payable to the employees who were
direct/regular employees of the establishment of SAIL under the
Minimum Wages Act.
24.After issuance of a prohibition notification under the CLRA
Act   dated   17th  March,   1993,   the   erstwhile   contract
labourers/respondents   herein   filed   writ   petitions   to   claim
regularisation of service and backwages in view of the law laid
down by three Judge Bench of this Court in  Air India Statutory
Corporation and Others case (supra) wherein it was held that on
issuance of prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the
CLRA Act, the logical and legitimate consequences were that the
erstwhile regulated contract labourer covered by the sweep of
18such abolition for the activities concerned would be entitled to be
treated as direct employee of the employer on the day on which
the   contract   labour   system   in   the   establishment   has   been
abolished.   But the theory of automatic absorption of contract
labour   by   the   principal   employer   in   the   establishment   on
issuance of a notification by the appropriate Government under
Section 10(1) of the Act was later overruled by the Constitution
Bench   of   this   Court   in   Steel   Authority   of   India   Ltd.   and
Others(supra).
25.It   is   necessary   to   point   out   that   Ministry   of   Labour,
Government of India vide its notification dated 12th  July, 1994,
while revising minimum rate of wages payable to the employees
employed in the mines had also specifically mentioned in clause
5 to the explanation that in case the existing rate of wages of any
employee as per the agreement are higher than the minimum
rates,   the   higher   rates   shall   be   protected   and   treated   as
minimum rates of wages.  Relevant para of the said notification is
quoted herein as under:­
“Where the existing rates of wages of any employee,
based on contract or agreement or otherwise are higher
than the rates notified herein, the higher rates shall be
19protected and treated as the minimum rates of wages
applicable for the purpose of this notification to such
employees.”
26.Such rate of wages as agreed in its tripartite agreement
dated 12th November, 1991 were paid at Rs. 11.65/­ per day over
and above the minimum wages with effect from 1st  April, 1991
and   that   was   indisputedly   complied   with   and   each   of   the
employee   (contract   labour)   who   had   served/worked   in   the
establishment had been paid his due wages until their services
came to be terminated by the respective contractors in April,
1996.
27.The claim of the respondents in their application filed under
Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 was that as they
had discharged the same or similar nature of work as that of
direct employee of the establishment, it makes them entitled for
the   wages   which   are   payable   to   an   employee   who   is
directly/regularly appointed in the establishment to whom wages
are paid in terms of NJCS memorandum of Agreement dated 30th
July, 1975.
2028.It is to be noted that National Joint Committee for the Steel
Industry (NJCS) started its functioning initially in the name of
JWNC(Joint Wage Negotiating Committee) in October 1969 and
was primarily established in pursuance of the decision taken by
the industrial committee on iron & steel in October, 1969.  The
Committee   has   now   changed   its   name   as   National   Joint
Committee for the Steel Industry (NJCS).  The scope of the NJCS
presently covers :­
i)Negotiations   for   wage   agreement   and   its
implementation.
ii)Matters pertaining to and steps to be taken for
increase in production, productivity, improvement
in quality, reduction of cost and wastage etc.
iii)Review of welfare amenities and facilities.
iv)Matters   on   which   it   is   necessary   to   draw   the
attention of the government; and
v)Any other matter pertaining to steel industry and
its employees as may be agreed to in the NJCS,
from time to time.
29.The membership of NJCS comprises 21 union leaders­ three
each from four national centres of trade unions: INTUC, AITUC,
CITU and HMS, one each from recognized unions of the steel
plants like Bhilai, Durgapur, Rourkela, Bokaro, TISCO, IISCO,
Alloy   Steels,   Salem   and   VISL,   and   12   management   staff
21managing   directors   of   the   steel   plants   of   Bhillai,   Rourkela,
Durgapur, Bokar and IISCO, Bumpur; executive directors of Alloy
Steels Plant, Salem Steel Plant and VISL; Vice­President(HRM),
TISCO;   Vice­Chairman   and   Directors(Finance)   of   SAIL.     The
Director(Personnel)   of   SAIL   is   the   Convenor­Member   of   the
Committee.  It is a permanent bipartite committee whose scope
extends beyond wage negotiations to implementation aspects and
other matters of concern to the industries and its employees.  It
is applicable to the wage structure across the steel industries in
the country.
30.It may be noticed that there are no pleadings on record and
primarily   the   burden   was   on   the   respondent   applicants   to
establish that the duties discharged by each of the employee was
same   or   similar   to   that   of   a   regular/direct   employee
appointed/employed   by   the   establishment   and   this   can   be
discerned from the facts pleaded in the application filed by one
Jaggu of which a reference has been made.   In absence of the
initial   burden   being   discharged   in   the   first   instance   by   the
respondent   employees,   the   onus   could   not   have   been  shifted
upon   the   appellant   SAIL   to   counter   the   nature   of   work
22discharged by each of the workmen as to whether it was the
same or similar to that of a permanent/regular employee of the
establishment and how far the principles of equal pay for equal
work claimed as enshrined under Article 14 and 39(d) of the
Constitution of India would be attracted in the facts of the case.
31.In this backdrop of the matter, it would be apposite to first
take note of the scheme of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948.  If we
look into the objects and reasons of the scheme of the Act, it
clearly manifests that the main object of the Act is to provide
minimum rates of wages for certain scheduled employment and
also provides for fixation and revision of minimum wages of the
workers, overtime rates, remuneration for the work done on a day
of rest, just to ensure that the employee has enough to provide to
his family and to ensure a decent living standard that pertains to
a social comfort of the employee and the cost of living index.  The
procedure for fixing and revising minimum rate of wages, which
has to be prescribed, is supported by the recommendation of
Advisory Committees/Advisory Board/ Central Advisory Board
being constituted under Sections 7 and 8 of the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948 and the appropriate Government on its acceptance
23notified the minimum wages which are payable to the category of
employees referred to under Section 2(i) of the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948.
32.Indisputedly, in the first place, the minimum wages which
were notified by the appropriate Government from time to time
under tripartite memorandum of agreement dated 12th November,
1991, signed by the appellant SAIL and the respondents before
the Assistant Labour Commissioner(Central), Jabalpur effective
from 1st April, 1991, it was agreed that the contract labour would
be paid Rs. 11.65/­ per day over and above the notified minimum
wages   with   effect   from   1st  April,   1991   which   has   been
indisputedly paid by the appellant SAIL till the employees were
allowed to work in the establishment i.e. April, 1996 when their
services came to be terminated by the contractor.
33.The exposition of scheme of the minimum wages Act, 1948
and its jurisdiction to invoke Section 20(1) of the Act has been
examined by this Court in  Town Municipal Council, Athani  Vs.
The Presiding Officer, Labour Courts, Hubli and Others, Etc.
(supra).
24“7. The   long   title   and   the   preamble   to   the   Minimum
Wages Act show that this Act was passed with the object
of making provision for fixing minimum rates of wages in
certain employments. The word “wages” has been given a
wide meaning in its definition in Section 2( h) of that Act
and,   quite   clearly,   includes   payment   in   respect   of
overtime and for work done on weekly off­days which are
required to be given by any employer to the workmen
under   the   provisions   of   that   Act   itself.   Section   13(1),
which   deals   with   weekly   off­days,   and   Section   14(1),
which deals with overtime, are as follows:
13.   (1)   In   regard   to   any   scheduled
employment   minimum   rates   of   wages   in
respect of which have been fixed under this
Act, the appropriate Government may—
(a)fix   the   number   of   hours   of   work
which   shall   constitute   a   normal
working   day,   inclusive   of   one   or
more specified intervals;
(b)provide for a day of rest in every
period of seven days which shall be
allowed to all employees or to any
specified class of employees and for
the   payment   of   remuneration   in
respect of such days of rest;
(c)provide for payment for work on a
day of rest at a rate not less than
the overtime rate.
14. (1) Where an employee, whose minimum
rate of wages is fixed under this Act by the
hour, by the day or by such a longer wage­
period as may be prescribed, works on any
day   in   excess   of   the   number   of   hours
constituting   a   normal   working   day,   the
employer shall pay him for every hour or for
part of an hour so worked in excess at the
overtime rate fixed under this Act or under
any law of the appropriate Government for
the time being in force, whichever is higher.
25In   order   to   provide   a   remedy   against
breach of orders made under Sections 13(1)
and 14(1), that Act provides a forum and the
manner of seeking the remedy in Section 20
which is as follows:
20. (1) The appropriate Government may, by
notification   in   the   Official   Gazette   appoint
any   Commissioner   for   Workmen's
Compensation or any officer of the Central
Government exercising functions as a Labour
Commissioner for any region, or any officer of
the State Government not below the rank of
Labour   Commissioner   or   any   other   officer
with experience as a Judge of a civil court or
as   a   stipendiary   Magistrate   to   be   the
Authority to hear and decide for any specified
area all claims arising out of payment of less
than   the   minimum   rates   of   wages   or   in
respect of the payment of remuneration for
days of rest or for work done on such days
under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub­section
(1) of Section 13 or of wages at the overtime
rate   under   Section   14,   to   employees
employed or paid in that area.
(2) Where an employee has any claim of the
nature   referred   to   in   sub­section   (1),   the
employee himself, or any legal practitioner or
any   official   of   a   registered   trade   union
authorised in writing to act on his behalf, or
any Inspector, or any person acting with the
permission of the Authority appointed under
sub­section (1), may apply to such Authority
for a direction under sub­section (2):
Provided that every such application shall
be presented within six months from the date
on   which   the   minimum   wages   or   other
amount became payable:
Provided further that any application may
be   admitted   after   the   said   period   of   six
months   when   the   applicant   satisfies   the
Authority that he had sufficient cause for not
making the application within such period.
26(3) ….
(4)….
(5)….
(6)….
(7)….
 
We have mentioned these provisions of the Minimum
Wages Act, because the language used at all stages in
that   Act   leads   to   the   clear   inference   that   that   Act   is
primarily   concerned   with   fixing   of   rates   —   rates   of
minimum   wages,   overtime   rates,   rate   for   payment   for
work on a day of rest — and is not really intended to be
an Act for enforcement of payment of wages for which
provision is made in other laws, such as the Payment of
Wages Act, 4 of 1936, and the Industrial Disputes Act 14
of 1947. In Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act also,
provision is made for seeking remedy in respect of claims
arising out of payment of less than the minimum rates of
wages or in respect of payment of remuneration for days
of rest or for work done on such days under clause ( b) or
clause (c) of sub­section (1) of Section 13 or of wages at
the overtime rate under Section 14.   This language used
in Section 20(1) shows that the Authority appointed
under that provision of law is to exercise jurisdiction
for deciding claims which relate to rates of wages,
rates for payment of work done on days of rest and
overtime   rates.   If   there   be   no   dispute   as   to   rates
between the employer and the employees, Section 20(1)
would not be attracted.   The purpose of Section 20(1)
seems to be to ensure that the rates prescribed under
the Minimum Wages Act are complied with by the
employer in making payments and, if any attempt is
made to make payments at lower rates, the workmen
are given the right to invoke the aid of the Authority
appointed under Section 20(1).  In cases where there is
no dispute as to rates of wages, and the only question is
whether   a   particular   payment   at   the   agreed   rate   in
respect of minimum wages, overtime or work on off­days
is due to a workman or not, the appropriate remedy is
provided in the Payment of Wages Act. If the payment is
withheld beyond the time permitted by the Payment of
Wages Act even on the ground that the amount claimed
by the workman is not due, or if the amount claimed by
the workman is not paid on the ground that deductions
are to be made by the employer, the employee can seek
his remedy by an application under Section 15(1) of the
27Payment of Wages Act. In cases where Section 15 of the
Payment of Wages Act may not provide adequate remedy,
the remedy can be sought either under Section 33­C of
the Act or by raising an industrial dispute under the Act
and having it decided under the various provisions of
that Act. In these circumstances, we are unable to accept
the   submission   made   by   Mr   Sen   on   behalf   of   the
appellant that Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act
should be interpreted as intended to cover all claims in
respect   of   minimum   wages   or   overtime   payment   or
payment for days of rest even though there may be no
dispute as to the rates at which those payments are to be
claimed. It is true that, under Section 20(3), power is
given to the Authority dealing with an application under
Section 20(1) to direct  payment  of the actual amount
found due; but this, it appears to us, is only an incidental
power granted to that Authority, so that the directions
made   by   the   Authority   under   Section   20(1)   may   be
effectively carried out and there may not be unnecessary
multiplicity of proceedings. The power to make orders for
payment of actual amount due to an employee under
Section   20(3)   cannot,   therefore,   be   interpreted   as
indicating that the jurisdiction to the Authority under
Section   20(1)   has   been   given   for   the   purpose   of
enforcement   of   payment   of   amounts   and   not   for   the
purpose of ensuring compliance by the employer with the
various rates fixed under that Act. This interpretation; in
our   opinion,   also   harmonises   the   provisions   of   the
Minimum Wages Act with the provisions of the payment
of Wages Act which was already in existence when the
Minimum Wages Act was passed. In the present appeals,
therefore, we have to see whether the claims which were
made by the workmen in the various applications under
Section 33­C(2) of the Act were of such a nature that they
could   have   been   brought   before   the   Authority   under
Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages Act inasmuch as
they raised disputes relating to the rates for payment of
overtime and for work done on weekly off­days.”
(Emphasis supplied)
34.The scheme of the Act of which reference has been made by
this Court clearly manifests that the Act is primarily concerned
with   fixing   rates   of   minimum   wages,   overtime   rates,   rate   for
28payment of work on a day of rest and is not really intended to be
an Act for enforcement of payment of wages for which provision
has been made in other laws such as the Payment of Wages Act,
1936 and the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  Section 20 of the
Minimum   Wages   Act,   1948   is   primarily   enacted   to   resolve
disputes about the rates of wages, rates of payment of work done
on days of rest and overtime rates and to ensure that the rates of
wages   which   are   notified   by   the   appropriate   Government   for
various categories of employees under the Minimum Wages Act
are   to   be   strictly   complied   with   by   the   employer   in   making
payments and if any payment is made at the rates lower than the
minimum   rates   of   wages   prescribed   by   the   appropriate
Government,   the   remedy   has   been   provided   to   the
workmen/employee to invoke Section 20(1) of the Act and being a
self­contained Code and  a  beneficial legislation, it is a social
protection   to   ensure   and   secure   adequate   living   wage   in   the
interest of public and looking to the nature of enquiry postulated
under the scheme of Minimum Wages Act, 1948, there appears
no scope of enquiry to examine the principles of equal pay for
equal work which is a dispute to be determined by a adjudicatory
mechanism provided under the law. 
2935.It was not the case of the respondent employees(2040 in
number) that the minimum rates of wages which were notified by
the   appropriate   Government   from   time   to   time   or   as   agreed
between the parties under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 have
not been paid.  But their claim in the application under Section
20(1) of the Act, was that, once they have been allowed to work
after   the   prohibition   notification   dated   17th  March,   1993   has
come   into   force,   pursuant   to   which   their   status   as   contract
labour  in  the establishment  ceased to  operate as  a result of
contract of principal employer with the contractor in regard to the
contract   labour
having   been   statutorily   extinguished,   their   relationship   stood
automatically   converted   into   the   employer   (i.e.,   SAIL   in   the
instant case) and the employee (i.e. contract labour) making them
entitled for wages which are notified by the NJCS as per the
memorandum of agreement which is payable to direct/regular
employees of SAIL.
36.The Division Bench of the High Court has also relied on the
scheme   of   CLRA   Rules,   1971   and   Rules   25(iv)   and   (v)   in
30particular while arriving to a conclusion that the workmen since
were allowed to continue to work by the principal employer after
the prohibition notification dated 17th March, 1993 has come into
force, and they were discharging same or similar kind of work as
the workmen directly employed by the principal employer in the
establishment, makes them entitled for similar wages admissible
to   the   regular   employees   appointed/engaged   by   SAIL.     Rules
25(iv) and (v) of Rules, 1971 are extracted hereunder:­
(iv) the rates of wages payable to the workmen by the
contractor shall not be less than the rates prescribed
under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (11 of 1948), for
such   employment   where   applicable   and   where   the
rates   have   been   fixed   by   agreement,   settlement   or
award, not less than the rates so fixed; 
(v) (a) in cases where the workman employed by the
contractor perform the same or similar kind of work as
the   workmen   directly   employed   by   the   principal
employer   of   the   establishment,   the   wage   rates,
holidays, hours of work and other conditions of service
of the workmen of the contractor shall be the same as
applicable to the workmen directly employed by the
principal employer of the establishment on the same or
similar kind of work:
Provided that in the case of any disagreement with
regard to the type of work the same shall be decided by
1 [the Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central)]; 
(b) in other cases the wage rates, holidays, hours of
work and conditions of service of the workmen of the
contractor shall be such as may be specified in this
behalf by 1 [the Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner
(Central)]; 
31Explanation.   —While   determining   the   wage   rates,
holidays,   hours   of   work   and   other   conditions   of
services   under   (b)   above,   the   Deputy   Chief   Labour
Commissioner (Central) shall have due regard to the
wage   rates,   holidays,   hours   of   work   and   other
conditions of service obtaining in similar employments;
37.The submission, in our view, is misplaced for the reason
that the CLRA Act is a complete code in itself and regulate the
employment   of  contract  labour   in   certain   establishments  and
provide for its abolition in certain circumstances and for matters
connected therewith.  The title of the Act itself indicates that the
Act does not provide for total abolition of the contract labour, but
only for its abolition in certain circumstances, and to regulate the
employment of contract labour in the establishments which are
registered under Section 7 and working through the contractors
who are holding licence under Section 12 of the Act.  Section 8
provides for the revocation of registration in certain cases and
Section 9 provides the effect of non­registration.   Section 10 is
one of the back bone of the Act which provides for prohibition of
employment of contract labour in any establishment and we are
fortified in our view supported by the Judgment of this Court in
Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd. (supra).
     
3238.In the instant case, the establishment was duly registered
under Section 7 of the Act and the contractor through whom the
contract   labour   was   engaged   was   holding   its   licence   under
Section 12 of the Act but in the changed circumstances, the
appropriate Government took a decision to put a prohibition in
making employment of contract labour in scheduled employment
for various reasons which is not a subject matter of enquiry in
the   instant   case   and   in   consequence   of   the   prohibition
notification   dated   17th  March,   1993   published   under   Section
10(1)   of   the   CLRA   Act,   the   contract   labour   working   in   the
establishment ceased to function and the contract between the
principal employer and contractor stands extinguished.
39.To make it further clear, Rule 25 of the Rules, 1971 of
which there was an emphasis before the High Court, may not
come to the rescue of the respondent employees for the reason
that it was an obligation upon the contractor who are holding a
licence under Section 12 of the Act and as per the terms and
conditions of the licence granted under sub­rule (1) of Rule 25 or
renewed   under   Rule   29,   to   comply   with   certain   conditions
enumerated under sub­rule (2) of Rule 25 of the Rules 1971
33which includes clause (iv) and (v) to be complied with by the
contractor and, if at all, there is any breach of the conditions of
licence, complaint can be made to the prescribed authority and
its consequences are imbedded under the Scheme of the CLRA
Act, 1970. 
 
40.At   the   same   time,   an   obligation   to   provide   amenities
conferred by the Act to the workers has been referred to under
Chapter V of the CLRA Act and the primary responsibility is of a
contractor that each worker employed by him as contract labour
has to be paid his due wages before the expiry of such period as
may  be   prescribed   with  an   exception  provided  under   Section
21(4) of the Act, in case the contractor fails to make payment of
wages within the prescribed period or makes short payment, then
the principal employer shall be liable to make payment of wages
in full or the unpaid balance due, as the case may be, to the
contract   labour   employed   by   the   contractor   and   recover   the
amount so paid from the contractor under any of the methods
prescribed by law.
3441.In   the   instant   case,   after   issuance   of   the   prohibition
notification dated 17th  March, 1993 under Section 10(1) of the
CLRA Act having being published, in our considered view, the
provisions of the CLRA Act or CLRA Central Rules, 1971 framed
thereunder   would   not   be   available   to   either   of   the   party   to
strengthen   its   claim.     As   stated   earlier,   minimum   wages   as
prayed   for   in   the   application   filed   by   respondents   before   the
prescribed authority under Section 20(1) of the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948 could be claimed independently under the Minimum
Wages Act, 1948 which indisputedly in the instant case was Rs.
11.65/­ per day over the minimum wages to be paid by the
appellant to each of the respondent (2040 employees) in terms of
the agreement executed between the parties and that was indeed
complied with by the appellants in its true spirit.
 
42.The   submission   made   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the
respondents that the respondent workmen were doing the jobs of
perennial in nature and the contract labour was banned under
agreements entered between SAIL and the workers union from
1970 onwards and their performance of same or similar kind of
work as the workmen directly employed by the principal employer
35make them entitled for wages in terms of NJCS Memorandum of
agreement is without substance for the reason that for fixation of
Minimum Wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, there are
number of considerations which are to be kept in mind by the
committees while prescribing the minimum rate of wages payable
to the workmen of a different category.  Under Section 3 of the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 the appropriate Government may fix
minimum wages for time work, minimum rate of wages for piece
work, minimum wages in respect of overtime work defined under
sub­Section 2 of Section 3 of the Act and the amendment made
in   Section   3   of   the   Act   also   take   note   of   different
classes/categories of employees in such employment while the
notification under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 came to be
published by the appropriate Government.  
43.In the given circumstances, a mere assertion of fact that the
contract   labour   which   was   allowed   to   continue   after   the
prohibition notification came to be published dated 17th March,
1993 in the establishment of the appellant SAIL performing same
or similar kind of work in the establishment of the principal
employer is not sufficient to endorse their entitlement of claiming
36wages   notified   by   the   NJCS   memorandum   of   agreement   for
direct/regular   employees   of   the   establishment   applicable
universally to all the steel industries.  The Judgment relied upon
by the learned counsel for the respondents in   BHEL     Workers
Association, Hardwar and Others   (supra) may not be of any
assistance in the facts of the instant case for the reason that it
was a writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India by the workers union seeking declaration from this Court
for   abolition   of   contract   labour   and   be   treated   as   direct
employees   of   the   establishment   and   entitled   to   equal   pay   as
workmen of the BHEL but that being a matter of enquiry by the
competent authority, their petition came to be dismissed with the
direction to the Union of India to examine their grievance in
accordance with law.
44.In   addition   to   it,   in   terms   of   reference   made   by   the
appropriate   Government   dated   27th  January,   2003   read   with
Corrigendum dated 9th  April, 2003 followed with 22nd  February,
2005, the CGIT framed various issues including issue nos. V & VI
and answered it accordingly.
Issue nos. V & VI are reproduced as under:­
37“V.Whether   lime   stone   mines   violated   the
provision   of   Clause­8   of   the   memorandum   of
agreement signed between the SAIL, New Delhi and
their   Unions   and   employing   workers   through
contractors on jobs of permanent and perennial nature
was justified, legal and fair?
VI.Whether   the   workmen/heirs   are   entitled   to
the wages to the post in which they were engaged with
parity of wages with that of regular employees of the
management with all consequential benefits?”
It has been answered as under:­
“It is evident that it is not established that the alleged
contract labours were the employees of the SAIL, as
such they were not entitled to any wages as per the
agreement.  Moreover they were not regular employees
of the management and the said agreement appears to
be for the regular employees of the management.  Thus
these issues are also decided against the Union and in
favour of the management.”
45.The   answer   thereto   has   been   upheld   by   us   in   the
independent proceedings.
46.In our considered view, the order of the prescribed authority
under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 dated  2nd December, 2003
and confirmed by the High Court under the impugned judgment
dated 11th December, 2006 are unsustainable and deserves to be
set aside.
3847.Consequently, Civil Appeal No. 8094 of 2011 filed by Steel
Authority of India Ltd. is accordingly allowed and order of the

Judgment of the High Court are hereby set aside.
48.Civil Appeal No. 8334 of 2011 filed by the employees(Jaggu

NON-REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3333 OF 2018
[Arising out of SLP (C) No. 726 of 2014]
Kedar Nath Kohli (Dead) by LRs. .. Appellants
Versus
Baldev Singh                 .. Respondent
J U D G M E N T
Mohan M. Shantanagoudar. J.
Leave granted.
2.Application for permission to file additional documents and
the translated copies thereof is allowed in terms of this Court’s
order dated 6.10.2017.
3.This  appeal  is  directed  against  the  judgment  and  order
dated 7.2.2013 passed by the High Court of Delhi in R.S.A. No.
133  of  2012,  whereby  the  High  Court  while  dismissing  the
Regular Second Appeal, has confirmed the concurrent judgments2
passed by the trial Court as well as the first appellate Court
dismissing the suit for possession.
4.The appellant’s father, namely, Mehar Chand Kohli was the
original plaintiff.  He filed a Civil Suit No. 354/03/75 against the
defendants claiming possession of Plot no. 27 bearing Municipal
No. 1443 situated in Wazir Nagar, Gali No. 7, Kotla Mubarakpur,
New Delhi on the ground that the father of the appellant was the
actual owner of the said property and the defendants were in
illegal possession of the same.  The said Mehar Chand Kohli, i.e.
the original plaintiff, died on 13.7.1980 and the appellant was
thus substituted as plaintiff in place of his father.  The trial
Court dismissed the suit on 21.9.2016.  The judgment of the trial
Court is confirmed by the first appellate Court in Regular Civil
Appeal No. 29 of 2011 dated 7.12.2011.  As mentioned supra, the
Regular Second Appeal No. 133 of 2012 filed by the appellant
questioning the judgments of the trial Court as well as the first
appellate Court also came to be dismissed by the High Court on
7.2.2013.
5.Brief facts leading to this appeal are as follows:3
The appellant-plaintiff claims that he is the owner of Plot no. 27
(now bearing Municipal no. 1443 situated in Wazir Nagar, Gali
No. 7, Kotla Mubarakpur, New Delhi) along with the adjoining
land  totally  measuring  260  square  yards.  The
respondents-defendants illegally trespassed into the above land
and have raised construction without the consent and knowledge
of  the  appellant.    The  said  construction  is  unauthorised
inasmuch  as  the  same  is  raised  without  sanction  from  the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (for short ‘MCD’) or any other
competent authority.   The respondents do not have any right to
be in possession of the said piece of land and they have not
handed  over  the  possession  of  the  plot  in  question  to  the
appellant  despite  repeated  requests  and  demands  by  the
appellant.   The respondents have also obtained electricity and
water  connections  by  misrepresenting  the  MCD.   The
respondents  though  have  no  ownership  over  the  property  in
question, encroached upon the same.   
Per contra, it is the case of the respondent that the appellant
is not the owner of the suit property as the same was purchased
by the respondent from one Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram as per
the sale deed dated 15.8.1966 for a consideration of Rs.10,000/-.4
Defendant nos. 1 and 2 (before the trial Court) are cousins.   The
respondent gave a portion of the plot in question to defendant no.
1 (since dead) and constructed structure on the plot in question
at their expenses.   Defendants are in physical possession of
property  constructed  on  part  of  plot  No.  1443.    The
appellant-plaintiff was estopped from filing suit as he had earlier
filed a suit for permanent injunction, which was dismissed.  In
sum and substance, the respondent-defendant took the plea that
he purchased the property from one Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram
through a registered deed dated 15.8.1966 and, therefore, he is
entitled to remain in the possession of the property.
6.It  is  pertinent  to  mention  that  original  defendant  no.  1
before the trial Court is reported to have died and he has been
deleted from the array of parties vide this Court’s order dated
28.9.2015  at  the  risk  of  the  appellant  and  now  the  only
respondent before us is the original defendant no. 2 – Baldev
Singh (respondent herein).
7.Heard learned advocates on both sides and perused the
records.  Learned counsel appearing for the appellant, taking us
through the material on record in detail and contends that the5
Courts below while concluding have concurrently erred in holding
that the appellant-plaintiff is not the owner of the property in
question and that the defendants have purchased the property
from one Dharampal vide sale deed dated 15.8.1966. 
It is relevant to note that after a huge gap of about 28 years
from the date of the suit, the respondent filed an application
before the trial Court under Order 6 Rule 17 read with Section
151  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  seeking  to  amend  the
pleadings. Through this application, the respondent sought to
change the number of the suit property from Municipal no. 1443
to 1443A and also the date of the sale deed from 15.8.1966 to
15.9.1966 to establish and prove his ownership over the suit
property.   The allegations were made by the appellant that the
respondent has forged the sale deed in his favour and that the
forged sale deed relied upon by the respondent cannot be made
the proof of ownership.  In that regard, the trial Court ordered for
an enquiry and has, however, concluded that the allegations so
made by the appellant regarding forgery of the documents are not
proved.  
8.     Both  the  parties  have  led  their  evidence,  both  oral  and
documentary.   The  crucial  document  is  the  sale  deed  dated6
15.9.1966 (Ex.DW1/1) produced by the respondent to show his
ownership of the plot in question, i.e. plot no. 27 (Municipal No.
1443).    Since there was an allegation of forgery in respect of the
said document, the enquiry was conducted, as mentioned supra,
and the trial Court summoned the original records pertaining to
the  said  sale  deed.   The  Office  of  the  Sub-Registrar,  Asaf  Ali
Road, Delhi produced the original document, i.e. the sale deed
15.9.1966, maintained in the Sub-Registrar’s office in a sealed
cover.  The trial Court has marked the said document which was
produced in the sealed cover as Ex.C1.    It is needless to mention
that  Ex.C1  is  the  original  document  maintained  in  the
Sub-Registrar’s  office  to  verify  as  to  whether  the  sale  deed
Ex.DW1/1 produced by the defendants is forged one or not.
9.     Ex.DW1/1 dated 15.9.1966 relied upon by the defendants
to show their ownership is in Urdu.   English translation is also
produced before us.   The English translation of Ex.DW1/1 is not
disputed by the learned counsel for the respondent.   Ex.DW1/1
relied upon by the respondent shows that Sardar Baldev Singh,
s/o Sardar Kartar Singh purchased one piece of land bearing no.
1443 measuring 230 square yards out of an area of 567 square
yards from Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram.  This sale deed also7
reveals that the said Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram had in turn
purchased the very property through a registered sale deed dated
5.12.1947 from Uday Chand, s/o Choudhury Wazir Singh.  This
sale deed, according to the appellant, is a forged one.  
10.The said document Ex.C1 is almost replication of Ex.DW1/1
in all particulars, except on material particulars .  Ex.C1 clearly
reveals  that  Sardar  Balwant  Singh,  s/o  Sardar  Kartar  Singh
purchased one plot of land measuring 230 square yards out of
567 square yards from Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram.    It is
curious to note that either Municipal no. 1443 or Municipal no.
1443A are not found in Ex.C1.  It is no doubt true that Ex.C1
also  relates  to  230  square  yards  out  of  567  square  yards,
purchased  through  a  sale  deed  dated  15.9.1966  from  one
Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram.  The very document also reveals
that  Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram  had  in  turn  purchased the
property from Uday Chand, s/o Choudhary Wazir Singh.   
11.The appellant has also relied upon the document Ex.C3
dated 5.12.1947 which is in Urdu language.   English translation
is also furnished and such translation is not disputed before us.
Through the said sale deed, Udai Chand, s/o Chaudhary Wazir8
Singh sold the three plots of land, i.e. plot nos. 30, 31 and 34 in
favour of Lala Dharampal, S/o Rai Sahab Choban Ram.  The sale
deed Ex.C3 further discloses that the three plots, namely plot
nos. 30, 31 and 34 which are adjoining each other and situated
at  Chameli  Wala,  known  as  Wazir  Singh  in  the  village
Mubarakpur Kotla, Delhi are carved out of one piece of land
measuring 567 square yards of different dimensions.   These
plots were sold in favour of Lala Dharampal, S/o Rai Sahab
Choban Ram for a valuable consideration through the said sale
deed by Shri Udai Chand.  The boundaries of the said plots
individually on all the four sides are mentioned in detail.  They
clearly reveal that the three plots are abutting each other.   
12.   Plot  no.  30  is  measuring  60  ft.  X  30  ft.  (200  square
yards); Plot no. 31 is measuring 60 ft. X 30 ft. (200 square yards)
and  Plot  no. 34 is measuring 58 ft. x 26 ft. (167.56 square
yards).  Thus,  it  is  amply  clear  that  all  the  said  three  sites
collectively  measure  about  567  square  yards.   Ex.C3  clearly
reveals that all the three plots were carved out of 567 square
yards only.  Hence, Choudhary Udai Singh, who was the owner of
567 square yards had formed three sites, viz. Plot nos. 30, 31
and 34, out of entire 567 square yards and sold all the three9
plots in favour of Lala Dharampal.   Not even an inch of property
was left after selling the three plots in total area of 567 square
yards after selling to Lala Dharampal.
13.One more sale deed (marked as Ex.DW4/1) on record is
dated 9.12.1947.  Through the said sale deed, Udai Chand, s/o
Chaudhary Wazir Singh sold plot no. 28 measuring 200 square
yards in favour of Pandit Ved Prakash Shukla, s/o Pandit Nand
Lal Shukla for a valuable consideration.  The boundaries of the
said plot no. 28 are also mentioned in the said sale deed, which
clarify that plot no. 28 is adjoining plot no. 27.  
14.The maps showing the plots are also on record.  A perusal of
the maps Ex.PW2/4 and Ex.DW1/3 reveal that plot nos. 30 and
31 are adjoining each other and they form one block.   East,
South and North of these plots are roads.  Another map relating
to plot no. 28, which was stated to be annexed with the sale deed
dated 9.12.1947, reveals that plot no. 28 sold by Uday Chand,
s/o Wazir Singh in favour of Ved Prakash Shukla, s/o Pandit
Nand Lal Shukla is adjoining plot no. 27.  To the East of plot no.
28, it is a 16 feet road and to the East of that 16 feet road is plot
no. 30.  To the West of plot no. 28 lies plot no. 27.  Thus, plot10
nos. 27 and 28 are also surrounded on three directions by the
roads.  The two maps clearly reveal that they match each other
and plot nos. 30, 31 and 34 are adjoining each other.   They also
reveal that to the West of plot No. 30 is a 16 feet road.  The West
of that 16 feet road is plot no. 28 measuring 200 square yards;
and West of plot no. 28 is plot no. 27.  
15.According to the respondent’s case, as mentioned supra, the
land in question was purchased by him vide sale deed dated
15.8.1966  (which  date  is  later  amended  after  22  years  as
15.9.1966) from one Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram.  In turn, Mr.
Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram had purchased the property from
Udai Chand, s/o Choudhary Wazir Singh vide sale deed no. 3292
dated 5.12.1947.   
16.As aforementioned, Ex.DW1/1 discloses that Sardar Baldev
Singh purchased plot no. 1443 measuring 230 square yards from
Dharampal, s/o Haveli Ram, whereas the original deed which
was summoned to the Court by the trial Court, which is marked
as Ex.CRW2/P1 (Ex.C1) clearly reveals that it was not the Baldev
Singh who has purchased the suit property, but it was Sardar
Balwant  Singh,  s/o  Sardar  Kartar  Singh.   So  also,  the  plot11
number of the Municipal plot no. 1443 is also not mentioned in
the original deed.   There is nothing on record to show that
Sardar Balwant Singh is the same as Sardar Baldev Singh.  So
also, there is nothing on record to show as to why and when the
number of the plot, i.e. plot no. 1443, was inserted in the sale
deed which is produced in support of the case of the respondent
as  Ex.DW1/1.    Thus,  fabrication  of  the  said  deed  dated
15.9.1966  (i.e.  Ex.DW1/1)  is  evident  from  comparison  of  the
same with the original sale deed received by the trial Court in the
sealed cover from Sub-Registrar’s office.  It is relevant to note
that Balwant Singh has nothing to do with the present case.
17.The sale deed Ex.DW1/1 dated 15.9.1966 is in respect of
the land measuring 230 square yards out of 567 square yards,
obviously  had  to  be  carved  out  of  plot  nos.  30,  31  and  34
belonging to Shri Dharampal.  The same is clear from the sale
deed 5.12.1947, under which the original owner Udai Chand had
sold the three plots in favour of Lala Dharampal, who in turn
sold the same in favour of Baldev Singh.  Thus, the sale deed
Ex.DW1/1 cannot be in respect of the appellant’s plot no. 27.12
18.The site plan of the locality of Kotla Mubarakpur, which was
marked as Ex.PW2/4 clearly shows that the location of property
bearing plot nos. 21, 22, 27, 28, 30 and 31 which are adjacent to
each other and in a straight row, of course, a small road of 16
feet exists in between plot nos. 28 and 30.
19.The site map of plot no. 28 dated 9.12.1947, which is a
certified copy obtained from the Sub-Registrar office, if compared
with the site map of plots bearing nos. 30, 31 and 34 dated
5.12.1947,  which  is  also  a  certified  copy  obtained  from  the
Sub-Registrar office, match with each other.  These maps were
stated to have been produced along with the sale deeds in respect
of those plots at the time of their registration.   The location of
plots as shown in the maps is exactly the same, as mentioned in
the sale deed pertaining to those plots.   Those sale deeds were
executed at an undisputed point of time.   These site maps help
in unmasking the fraud committed.
20.We have already discussed in detail about the location of
each of the plots, including plot no. 27, which is adjacent to plot
no. 28 owned by one Ved Prakash Shukla.  As mentioned earlier,
plot no. 27 lies to the west of plot no. 28.  Even, according to the13
respondent, his plot is adjacent to plot no. 28 of Ved Prakash
Shukla and he relies upon Ex.DW1/1 to support his contention.
Thus, the respondent’s claim to have allegedly purchased the
property from one Dharampal, who owned plot nos. 30, 31 and
34 which lie on the east of plot no. 28 and 16 feet road.  Under
no circumstance, plot no. 27 can ever be carved out from plot
nos. 30, 31 and 34, as sought to be shown by the respondent,
inasmuch as such claim leaves the existence of plot no. 28 totally
inexplicable as per the claims and the site map submitted by the
respondent.   
21.In so far as the plaintiff’s/appellant’s case is concerned, we
do not find any reason to suspect the sale deed pertaining to plot
no.  27  purchased  by  the  appellant’s  father,  namely,  Mehar
Chand, s/o Maghar Mal.  The appellant-plaintiff relies upon the
sale  deed  dated  30.5.1952.   The  copy  of  the  said  sale  deed
produced before the court was in Urdu language, the translation
of  which  in  English  language  is  also  produced  for  the
convenience  of  the  court.   It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the
respondent’s  counsel  has  not  objected  to  such  English
translation  of the  said sale  deed in  favour  of  the  appellant’s
father produced before the Court. The said sale deed reveals that14
Smt. Kesara Devi, d/o Lala Chint Ram, w/o Lala Sham Lala
purchased the residential land measuring 200 square yards (60
ft.  x  30  ft.)  bearing  no.  27  situated  at  Wazir  Nagar,  village
Mubarak Kotla, Delhi from Smt. Kailashwati on 23.1.1948, which
was confirmed/registered on 10.3.1948 before the Sub-Registrar,
Delhi.  The said Kesara Devi, d/o Lala Chint Ram in turn sold the
said property in favour of Shri Mehar Chand, s/o Lala Maghar
Mal, who is none other than the father of the appellant-plaintiff
for  a  valuable  consideration.   In  the  very  sale  deed,  the
boundaries are mentioned.  It is specified in the said sale deed
that plot no. 28 abuts plot no. 27 in the East (i.e. plot no. 27 is to
the west of plot no. 28).   So also, all other sides of the said
property are surrounded by road.  The boundaries mentioned in
the said sale deed executed by Smt. Kesara Devi in favour of the
appellant’s father fully concur with the boundaries of plot no. 28,
as is clear from the sale deed pertaining to the said plot no. 28 as
well as from the maps.  After the demise of appellant’s father, the
appellant has inherited the said plot and thus has become the
owner of the said plot no. 27.  It is not the case of the respondent
that he had purchased plot no. 27 from Smt. Kesara Devi who is
the real owner of the property.  15
22.It  is  the  specific  case  of  the  respondent  that  he  had
purchased plot no. 27 carved out of 567 square yards of land
belonging to one Dharampal.  Since such Dharampal was never
the owner of plot no. 27, there was no occasion of transferring
the  title  relating  to  plot  no.  27  in  favour  of  the  respondent.
Hence, it is amply proved by the appellant that he is the owner of
plot no. 27 and that he is entitled to get back the possession of
the  same  from  the  respondent,  who  is  in  unauthorised
possession.
23.Having regard to the aforementioned discussion, we are of
the clear view that the appellant has proved his case and the suit
is to be decreed.  The trial Court and the first appellate Court
unfortunately  have  erred  to  take  into  consideration  the
aforementioned factual aspects while coming to the conclusion.
The High Court has also, without assigning any valid reason,
confirmed the judgments of the trial Court and the first appellate
Court, which led to injustice.
24.Accordingly,  the  appeal  is  allowed.   The  impugned
judgments of the High Court, first appellate Court and the trial
Court are set aside and the civil suit no. 354/03/75 filed by the16
original plaintiff Late Mehar Chand Kohli before the trial Court is
decreed.

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURSIDCITON
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1685 OF 2017
 [Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.5510 of 2017]
FEKAN YADAV     … APPELLANT
VERSUS
SATENDRA YADAV @ BOSS YADAV
@ SATENDRA KUMAR AND ORS. …RESPONDENTS
J U D G M E N T
S.ABDUL NAZEER, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.Respondents 1 and 2 were apprehending their arrest in Karpi
P.S. Case No.07/17, registered under Section 363, 365 read with
Section  34  of  IPC.  Therefore,  they  filed  an  anticipatory  bail
petition to extend the privilege of pre-arrest bail to them, before
the Additional Sessions Judge-II, Jehanabad in A.B.P.No.148 of
2017.  Learned Sessions Judge by his order dated 16.02.2017,
rejected their petition. Thereafter they filed a petition before the2
High  Court  of  Judicature  at  Patna  in  Criminal  Miscellaneous
No.12482 of 2017.  The High Court vide order dated 27.4.2017,
allowed the petition and granted anticipatory bail to them, subject
to certain conditions stated therein. The appellant has questioned
the legality and correctness of the said order in this appeal.
3.Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the son of
the  appellant,  namely,  Bittu  Kumar  was  kidnapped  by
respondents 1 and 2 and other co-accused on 3.1.2017.  The
appellant  could  not  trace  the  child  despite  his  best  efforts.
Therefore, the appellant lodged FIR with the Karpi Police Station.
It is further submitted that few months prior to the kidnapping,
the respondent No.1 had threatened the appellant that he will kill
the appellant’s son. Therefore, the High Court was not justified in
granting anticipatory bail to respondent Nos. 1 and 2.
4.Learned counsel for the State of Bihar, the third respondent
herein, submits that having regard to the gravity of accusations
made  against  the  respondent  Nos.  1  and  2,  it  is  absolutely
necessary for their custodial interrogation.  3
5.Learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submits that
respondents 1 and 2 have been falsely implicated in the case.
Therefore, the High Court has rightly granted pre-arrest bail to
the respondents 1 and 2.
6.We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned
counsel made at the Bar and perused the materials placed on
record.
7.It is evident from the FIR that the appellant has informed
that his son, Bittu Kumar was a student of Baal Siksha Niketan
Karpi, Arwal.  On 3.1.2017 at about 3 p.m. Bittu Kumar left for
school from his residence by boarding a tempo in village Ramapur
Mushari.  But he did not reach the school and on 4.1.2017 the
appellant  came  to  know  that  his  son,  Bittu  Kumar  had
disappeared on the way.  Six months prior to the incident, the
first respondent had threatened the appellant that he will be
made issueless.  Three months prior to the incident, the first
respondent,  Satendra Yadav  had  gone  to  the  school  of  Bittu
Kumar and called him outside the school.  However, Bittu Kumar
did not join the first respondent.  That is why the appellant has4
raised his suspicion against respondent Nos. 1 and 2, that they
have kidnapped his son.  Learned Sessions Judge examined the
case diary and found that the witnesses examined by the IO
during  the  investigation  had  supported  the  case  of  the
prosecution. The victim boy has not been traced so far.
8.The High Court without assigning any reasons has granted
the anticipatory bail.  Having regard to the nature and gravity of
the accusations, we are of the view that the High Court was not
justified in granting anticipatory bail. Hence, the appeal is allowed
and the order of the High Court dated 27.4.2017 in Crl.Misc.
No.12482 of 2017 is hereby set aside.

Part-1.
The petitioner’s marital discord, and the petitioner’s prayers:
1.The  petitioner-Shayara  Bano,  has  approached  this
Court, for assailing the divorce pronounced by her husband –
Rizwan Ahmad on 10.10.2015, wherein he affirmed “…in the
presence of witnesses saying that I gave ‘talak, talak, talak’,
hence like this I divorce from you from my wife. From this date
there is no relation of husband and wife.  From today I am
‘haraam’, and I have become ‘naamharram’.  In future you are
free  for  using  your  life  …”.   The  aforesaid  divorce  was
pronounced before Mohammed Yaseen (son of Abdul Majeed)
and Ayaaz Ahmad (son of Ityaz Hussain) – the two witnesses.
The  petitioner  has  sought  a  declaration,  that  the
‘talaq-e-biddat’ pronounced by her husband on 10.10.2015 be
declared as void ab initio.  It is also her contention, that such a
divorce which abruptly, unilaterally and irrevocably terminates
the  ties  of  matrimony,  purportedly  under  Section  2  of  the
Muslim  Personal  Law  (Shariat)  Application  Act,  1937
(hereinafter  referred  to  as,  the  Shariat  Act),  be  declared
4unconstitutional.  During  the  course  of  hearing,  it  was
submitted,  that  the  ‘talaq-e-biddat’       (-triple  talaq),
pronounced by her husband is not valid, as it is not a part of
‘Shariat’ (Muslim ‘personal law’).  It is also the petitioner’s case,
that divorce of the instant nature, cannot be treated as “rule of
decision” under the Shariat Act.  It was also submitted, that
the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is violative of the fundamental
rights guaranteed to citizens in India, under Articles 14, 15
and 21 of the Constitution. It is also the petitioner’s case, that
the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ cannot be protected under the
rights  granted  to  religious  denominations  (-or  any  sections
thereof) under Articles 25(1), 26(b) and 29 of the Constitution.
It  was  submitted,  that  the  practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  is
denounced  internationally,  and  further,  a  large  number  of
Muslim theocratic countries, have forbidden the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, and as such, the same cannot be considered
sacrosanctal to the tenets of the Muslim religion.
2.The counter affidavit filed by respondent no.5 – the
petitioner’s  husband  –  Rizwan  Ahmad,  discloses,  that  the
‘nikah’ (marriage) between the petitioner and the respondent
was solemnized on 11.04.2001, as per ‘Shariat’, at Allahabad.
It  was  submitted,  that  the  petitioner  –  Shayara  Bano,
performed her matrimonial duties intermittently, coming and
leaving  the  matrimonial  home  from  time  to  time.   The
5matrimonial relationship between the parties resulted in the
births of two children, a son – Mohammed Irfan (presently
about  13  years  old)  studying  in  the  7th standard,  and  a
daughter  –  Umaira  Naaz  (presently  about  11  years  old)
studying in the 4th standard, both at Allahabad.
3.It  is  the  case  of  the  respondent–husband,  that  the
petitioner-wife, left her matrimonial home on 9.4.2015 in the
company of her father – Iqbal Ahmad and maternal uncle –
Raees  Ahmed,  as  well  as  children  –  Mohammed  Irfan  and
Umaira Naaz, to live in her parental home.  The respondent
claims, that he continued to visit the petitioner, for giving her
maintenance, and for enquiring about her well being.  When
the husband met the wife at her parental home in May and
June  2015,  she  refused  to  accompany  him,  and  therefore,
refused to return to the matrimonial home.  On 03.07.2015,
Rizwan Ahmad, asked the father of Shayara Bano to send her
back to her matrimonial home.  He was informed by her father,
after a few days, that the petitioner was not inclined to live
with the respondent.
4.On 07.07.2015 the father of the petitioner, brought the
two  children  –  Mohammed  Irfan  and  Umaira  Naaz  to
Allahabad.  The husband submits, that both the children have
thereafter been in his care and custody, at Allahabad.  It is the
assertion of the husband, that the petitioner’s father had given
6him the impression, that the petitioner would be inclined to
return to Allahabad, consequent upon the husband’s care and
custody of both children, at the matrimonial home.
5.It is claimed by the respondent-husband, that he made
another  attempt  to  bring  back  the  petitioner-wife  from  her
parental home on 09.08.2015, but Shayara Bano refused to
accompany him.  It is submitted, that Rizwan  Ahmad was
opposed in the above endeavour, both by the petitioner’s father
and her maternal uncle.
6.Finding  himself  in  the  above  predicament,  Rizwan
Ahmad approached the Court of the Principal Judge, Family
Court at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, by preferring Matrimonial
Case No.1144 of 2015 with a prayer for restitution of conjugal
rights.  The  petitioner-Shayara  Bano,  preferred  Transfer
Petition (C) No. 1796 of 2015, under Section 25 of the Code of
Civil  Procedure,  1908,  read  with  Order  XXXVI-B  of  the
Supreme Court Rules, 1966, for the transfer of Matrimonial
Case  No.1144  of  2015,  filed  by  the  respondent-husband
(seeking restitution of conjugal rights) pending at Allahabad,
Uttar Pradesh, to the Principal Judge, Family Court, Kashipur,
Uttarakhand.  In the above transfer petition, the wife inter alia
asserted as under:
““2.3The  Petitioner  who  hails  from  Kashipur,
Uttarakhand  is  unemployed  and  her  father  is  a
government employee.  The only source of income is the
Petitioner’s father who has a low income and despite
7this the Petitioner during the time of marriage had made
arrangements beyond their capacity.  But soon after the
marriage the Respondent husband started demanding
for additional dowry and made unreasonable demands
for a car and cash.
2.4 The Petitioner who rightfully denied the demands of
the Respondent was tortured and physically abused by
the Respondent and his family.  She was often beaten
and kept hungry in a closed room for days. The family of
the Respondent administered her with medicines that
caused her memory to fade.  Due to the medicines she
remained unconscious for long hours.
Xxx xxx xxx
2.6 On 09.04.2015, the Respondent attempted to
kill the Petitioner by administering medicines.  These
medicines on  inspection by a doctor on a later date
were  revealed  to  cause  loss  of  mental  balance  after
regular  consumption.   The  Respondent  brought  the
Petitioner  to  Moradabad  in  a  critical  near-death
condition with the intention of abandoning her if his
dowry demands were not fulfilled.
2.7.Thereafter  on  10.04.2015  the  Respondent
called the parents of the Petitioner to Moradabad to take
their daughter.  The parents of the Petitioner requested
him to come to Kashipur to meet and settle the issue.
He refused to go to Kashipur and said that they should
come and take their daughter or fulfil his demands for
more dowry.  He demanded Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five
Lakh Only).
2.8.Due  to  the  unreasonable  demands  and  the
torturous  behaviour  of  the  Respondent husband,  the
Petitioner’s parents came to Moradabad to take her and
she  was  forced  to  stay  with  her  parents  after
10.04.2015.
xxx xxx xxx
2.13The Respondent has filed for restitution despite
the fact that he himself had asked the Petitioner wife’s
father to either fulfil his dowry demands or to take the
Petitioner back to her maternal home and in pursuance
of the same had drugged the Petitioner and had left her
in Moradabad.”
7.It is the case of the respondent-Rizwan Ahmad, that in
view of the above averments of the petitioner-Shayara Bano, he
felt that his wife was not ready for reconciliation, and therefore,
8he  withdrew  the  suit  (-for  restitution  of  conjugal  rights),
preferred  by  him  at  Allahabad,  and  divorced  the
petitioner-Shayara Bano, by serving upon her a ‘talaq-nama’
(deed  of  divorce)  dated  10.10.2015.   The  text  of  the
‘talak-nama’, is reproduced below:
“Deed of Divorce
Dated 10.10.2015
Madam,
Shayra Bano D/o Iqbal Ahmad.
Be  it  clear  that  I  Rizwan  Ahmed  married  with  you
without  any  dowry  to  spend  a  peaceful  and  happy
marital life.  After marriage you came in my marital tie.
From  the  relation  between  you  and  me  two  issues
namely Irfan Ahmad aged about 13 years and Kumari
Humaira Naz @ Muskan aged about 11 years were born
who  are  receiving  education  living  under  my
guardianship.  With a great sorrow it is being written
that you, just after 6 months of marriage, with your
unreasonable  and  against  Sharia  acts  started  to
pressurize me to live separately from my parents.  I, in
order to keep you happy and as per your wish started to
live at a rented house at Mohalla Ghausnagar and while
working as a clerk under a builder tried my level best to
spend  peaceful  marital  life  with  you  and  children.
However, you, in an unreasonable manner and against
Shriah  continued  to  create  problem  and  quarrel  in
house  on  regular  basis.   When  you  were  asked  the
reason in a very affectionate manner about two years
ago, you had put a condition that now when your other
relatives are not with you in such situation come with
me to my parents’ house and live further life there.  I
being a person from a self-respecting family refused to
live as ‘son in law living at in-laws house’.  Then you,
under the influence of your parents, continued to fake
various  mental  and  physical  pains  and  continued  to
behave life a mental patient.  When tried to know the
reason then you after much difficulty told that you had
9med with a serious accident before marriage.  I for the
sake of my children and you tolerated that.  I became
despondent from  your persistent demand of living at
your parental house and your being of stubborn nature,
your giving threat of implicating in false case and threat
of inflicting injury to yourself and of consuming poison
and implicating me in false case on that count given on
daily  basis  and  complained  about  the  same  to  your
paternal uncle but your father replied that whenever you
do such acts sleeping pills be given to you.  I found this
very baffling, upon asking your father told that since the
time  before  your  marriage  you  had  been  under
treatment  for  mental  ailment.   I  ignored  such  a  big
incident  and  the  information  received  about  you.
Resultantly  you  became  audacious  in  your  behavior.
When  reported  all  these  things  to  your  father,  your
father told me that this is the time of children’s holidays
you be sent to your parents’ house with children.  You
take them back after the atmosphere is changed and
summer vacations are over.  Acting on the words of your
father  I  left  you  at  your  parents’  place  along  with
children and while going, you took away gold jewelry
given by me including a gold neck set of two Tolas, gold
bangles of one and a half Tola, two gold rings of half
Tola and cash Rs.15,000/-.  I continued to visit you
enquiring your wellbeing and giving you expenses from
time to time.  That in the month of May and June when
I tried to bring you then you gave excuses and pleas.  I
continued to make repeated attempts between May to
July to bring you back but ultimately on 03.07.2015 you
clearly refused to return and on 07.07.2015 you father
brought both the children at Allahabad Railway Station
and left them there informing me and gave threat on
phone that either you will come here and live or shall
perform  the  role  of  father  and  mother  of  both  the
children.  In this regard when I enquired from you then
you also refused to return in clear words and said to the
extent  that  you  raise  the  children  and  forget  me  or
separate  from  me  to  bring  another  mother  for  the
children.   On  this  also  I  could  not  satisfy  myself,
whereupon I filed a suit for bringing you back.  After
receiving notice, out of the blues you threatened me on
phone that I will soon file a case and will tell you how a
son in law is kept at the in-laws house.  Being fed up
with your unreasonable conduct and against Sharaih
acts I found it better to separate from you, therefore, I
on  8.10.2015  applied  for  dismissal  of  the  suit  for
bringing you back and now I, in my full senses and in
10the presence of marginal witnesses, release you from my
marriage in the light of Shariah through tripel talaq by
uttering ‘I give talaq’, ‘I give talaq’, ‘I give talaq’.  From
today  the  relation  of  husband  and  wife  forever  ends
between you and me.  After today you are unlawful for
me and I have become unlawful for you.  You are free to
spend your life the way you want.
Note:  So far is the question of your dower (Mehr) and
expenses  of  waiting  period  (iddat)  that  I  am  paying
through  demand  draft  no.096976  dated  06.10.2015
drawn at Allahabad Bank, Karaili, Allahabad Branch,
which comprises a sum of Rs.10,151 towards payment
of dower and Rs.5,500/- towards the expenses of waiting
period which I am sending along with this written deed
of divorce, you kindly take paid to accept the same.

8. Based on the above, the case of the 
respondent-husband is, that he had pronounced ‘talaq’ in 
consonance with the prevalent and valid mode of dissolution of
Muslim marriages. It was submitted, that the pronouncement 
of divorce by him, fulfils all the requirements of a valid divorce,
under the Hanafi sect of Sunni Muslims, and is in consonance 
with ‘Shariat’ (Muslim ‘personal law’).
9.It is also the submission of the respondent-husband, 
that the present writ petition filed by the petitioner-wife under 
11Article 32 of the Constitution of India, is not maintainable, as 
the questions raised in the petition are not justiciable under 
Article 32 of the Constitution.
10.Keeping in view the factual aspect in the present case, 
as also, the complicated questions that arise for consideration 
in this case (and, in the other connected cases), at the very 
outset, it was decided to limit the instant consideration, to 
‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.  Other questions raised in the 
connected writ petitions, such as, polygamy and ‘halala’ (-and 
other allied matters), would be dealt with separately.  The 
determination of the present controversy, may however, 
coincidentally render an answer even to the connected issues.
Part-2.
T  he practiced modes of ‘talaq’ amongst Muslims:
11.Since the issue under consideration is the dissolution
of marriage by ‘talaq’, under the Islamic law of divorce, it is
imperative, to understand the concept of ‘talaq’.  In this behalf,
it is relevant to mention, that under  the Islamic law, divorce is
classified into three categories.  Talaq understood simply, is a
means of divorce, at the instance of the husband. ‘Khula’, is
another mode of divorce, this divorce is at the instance of the
wife.  The third category of divorce is ‘mubaraat’ – divorce by
mutual consent.
1212.‘Talaq’, namely, divorce at the instance of the husband,
is  also  of  three  kinds  –  ‘talaq-e-ahsan’,  ‘talaq-e-hasan’  and
‘talaq-e-biddat’.  The petitioner’s contention before this Court
is, that ‘talaq-e-ahsan’, and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ are both approved
by the ‘Quran’ and ‘hadith’. ‘Talaq-e-ahsan’, is considered as
the ‘most reasonable’ form of divorce, whereas, ‘talaq-e-hasan’
is  also  considered  as  ‘reasonable’.   It  was  submitted,  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’  is  neither  recognized  by  the  ‘Quran’  nor  by
‘hadith’, and as such, is to be considered as sacrosanctal to
Muslim  religion.   The  controversy  which  has  arisen  for
consideration  before  this  Court,  is  with  referenc  to
‘talaq-e-biddat’.
13.It is necessary for the determination of the present
controversy, to understand the parameters, and the nature of
the  different  kinds  of  ‘talaq’.  ‘Talaq-e-ahsan’  is  a  single
pronouncement of ‘talaq’ by the husband, followed by a period
of abstinence.  The period of abstinence is described as ‘iddat’.
The duration of the ‘iddat’ is ninety days or three menstrual
cycles (in case, where the wife is menstruating).  Alternatively,
the period of ‘iddat’ is of three lunar months (in case, the wife
is not menstruating).  If the couple resumes cohabitation or
intimacy, within the period of ‘iddat’, the pronouncement of
divorce  is  treated  as  having  been  revoked.   Therefore,
‘talaq-e-ahsan’  is  revocable.  Conversely,  if  there  is  no
13resumption of cohabitation or intimacy, during the period of
‘iddat’, then the divorce becomes final and irrevocable, after the
expiry  of  the  ‘iddat’  period.   It  is  considered  irrevocable
because, the couple is forbidden to resume marital relationship
thereafter, unless they contract a fresh ‘nikah’ (-marriage), with
a fresh ‘mahr’.  ‘Mahr’ is a mandatory payment, in the form of
money or possessions, paid or promised to be paid, by the
groom or by the groom’s father, to the bride, at the time of
marriage, which legally becomes her property.  However, on the
third  pronouncement  of  such  a  ‘talaq’,  the  couple  cannot
remarry, unless the wife first marries someone else, and only
after her marriage with other person has been dissolved (either
through ‘talaq’ - divorce, or death), can the couple remarry.
Amongst Muslims, ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ is regarded as – ‘the most
proper’ form of divorce.
14.‘Talaq-e-hasan’ is pronounced in the same manner, as
‘talaq-e-ahsan’.  Herein, in place of a single pronouncement,
there  are  three  successive  pronouncements.  After  the  first
pronouncement  of  divorce,  if  there  is  resumption  of
cohabitation within a period of one month, the pronouncement
of  divorce  is  treated  as  having  been  revoked.   The  same
procedure is mandated to be followed, after the expiry of the
first month (during which marital ties have not been resumed).
‘Talaq’ is pronounced again.  After the second pronouncement
14of ‘talaq’, if there is resumption of cohabitation within a period
of  one  month,  the  pronouncement  of  divorce  is  treated  as
having been revoked.  It is significant to note, that the first and
the second pronouncements may be revoked by the husband.
If  he  does  so,  either  expressly  or  by  resuming  conjugal
relations,  ‘talaq’  pronounced  by  the  husband  becomes
ineffective, as if no ‘talaq’ had ever been expressed.  If the third
‘talaq’ is pronounced, it becomes irrevocable.  Therefore, if no
revocation is made after the first and the second declaration,
and the husband makes the third pronouncement, in the third
‘tuhr’ (period of purity), as soon as the third declaration is
made, the ‘talaq’ becomes irrevocable, and the marriage stands
dissolved,  whereafter,  the  wife  has  to  observe  the  required
‘iddat’ (the period after divorce, during which a woman cannot
remarry.  Its purpose is to ensure, that the male parent of any
offspring is clearly identified). And after the third ‘iddat’, the
husband and wife cannot remarry, unless the wife first marries
someone else, and only after her marriage with another person
has been dissolved (either through divorce or death), can the
couple remarry.  The distinction between ‘talaq-e-ashan’ and
‘talaq-e-hasan’  is,  that  in  the  former  there  is  a  single
pronouncement of ‘talaq’  followed by abstinence  during the
period  of  ‘iddat’,  whereas,  in  the  latter  there  are  three
pronouncements of ‘talaq’, interspersed with abstinence.  As
15against ‘talaq-e-ahsan’, which is regarded as ‘the most proper’
form of divorce, Muslims regard ‘talaq-e-hasan’ only as ‘the
proper form of divorce’.
15.The third kind of ‘talaq’ is – ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  This is
effected by one definitive pronouncement of ‘talaq’ such as, “I
talaq you irrevocably” or three simultaneous pronouncements,
like  “talaq,  talaq,  talaq”,  uttered  at  the  same  time,
simultaneously.   In  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  divorce  is  effective
forthwith.  The instant talaq, unlike the other two categories of
‘talaq’  is  irrevocable  at  the  very moment  it  is  pronounced.
Even amongst Muslims ‘talaq-e-biddat’, is considered irregular.
16.According  to  the  petitioner,  there  is  no  mention  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ in the Quran.  It was however acknowledged,
that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ can be traced to the second
century, after the advent of Islam.  It was submitted, that
‘talaq-e-biddat’ is recognized only by a few Sunni schools. Most
prominently, by the Hanafi sect of Sunni Muslims.  It was
however emphasized, that even those schools that recognized
‘talaq-e-biddat’ described it, “as a sinful form of divorce”.  It is
acknowledged, that this form of divorce, has been described as
“bad in theology, but good in law”.  We have recorded the
instant position at this juncture, because learned counsel for
the rival parties, uniformly acknowledge the same.
Part-3.
16The Holy Quran – with reference to ‘talaq’ :
17.Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed by God to
the  Prophet  Muhammad  over  a  period  of  about  23  years,
beginning from 22.12.609, when Muhammad was 40 years old.
The revelation continued upto the year 632 – the year of his
death.  Shortly  after  Muhammad’s  death,  the  Quran  was
completed by his companions, who had either written it down,
or  had  memorized  parts  of  it.  These  compilations  had
differences of perception. Therefore, Caliph Usman - the third,
in the line of caliphs recorded a standard version of the Quran,
now known as Usman’s codex.  This codex is generally treated,
as the original rendering of the Quran.
18.During the course of hearing, references to the Quran
were  made  from  ‘The  Holy  Quran:  Text  Translation  and
Commentary’  by  Abdullah  Yusuf  Ali,  (published  by  Kitab
Bhawan,  New  Delhi,  14th edition,  2016).   Learned  counsel
representing the rival parties commended, that the text and
translation in this book, being the most reliable, could safely
be relied upon. The text and the inferences are therefore drawn
from the above publication.
(i)The  Quran  is  divided  into  ‘suras’  (chapters).   Each
‘sura’ contains ‘verses’, which are arranged in sections.  Since
our determination is limited to the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
within the framework of the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’,
17we shall only make a reference to such ‘verses’ from the Quran,
as  would  be  relevant  for  our  above  determination.  In  this
behalf, reference may first be made to ‘verses’ 222 and 223
contained in ‘section’ 28 of ‘sura’ II.  The same are reproduced
below:
“222. They ask thee
     Concerning women’s courses.
     Say : They are
     A hurt and a pollution :
     So keep away from women
     In their courses, and do not
     Approach them until
     
     They are clean.
                  But when they have
                  Purified themselves,
                  Ye may approach them
                  In any manner, time, or place 
                  Ordained for you by God.
                  For God loves those
                  Who turn to Him constantly
                  And he loves those
                  Who keep themselves pure and clean.
      223.Your wives are
                  As a tilth unto you ;
                  So approach your tilth
                  When or how ye will ;
                  But do some good act
                  For your souls beforehand ;
                  And fear God,
                  And know that ye are
                  To meet Him (in the Hereafter),
                  And give (these) good tidlings
                  To those who believe.”
TThe above ‘verses’ have been extracted by us for the reason,
that the Quran mandates respectability at the hands of men –
towards women.  ‘Verse’ 222 has been interpreted to mean,
that  matters  of  physical  cleanliness  and  purity  should  be
18looked at, not only from a man’s point of view, but also from
the woman’s point of view.  The ‘verse’ mandates, that if there
is  danger  of  hurt  to  the  woman,  she  should  have  every
consideration.  The  Quran  records,  that  the  action,  of  men
towards women are often worse.  It mandates, that the same
should be better with reference to the woman’s health, both
mental and spiritual.  ‘Verse’ 223 postulates, that sex is as
solemn,  as  any  other  aspect  of  life.   It  is  compared  to  a
husband-man’s tilth, to illustratively depict, that in the same
manner as a husband-man sows his fields, in order to reap a
harvest, by choosing his own time and mode of cultivation, by
ensuring that he does not sow out of season, or cultivate in a
manner which will injure or exhaust the soil.  So also, in the
relationship towards a wife, ‘verse’ 223 exalts the husband, to
be wise and considerate towards her, and treat her in such
manner as will neither injure nor exhaust her. ‘Verses’ 222 and
223  exhort  the  husband,  to  extend  every  kind  of  mutual
consideration, as is required towards a wife.  
(ii)Reference  is  also  necessary  to  ‘verses’  224  to  228
contained in section 28 of ‘sura’ II of the Quran.  The same are
extracted below:
“224. And make not 
God’s (name) an excuse
In your oaths against
Doing good, or acting rightly,
Or making peace
Between persons;
19For God is one
Who heareth and knoweth
All things.
225. God will not
Call you to account 
For thoughtlessness
In your oaths,
But for the intention
In your hearts; 
And He is 
Oft-forgiving 
Most Forbearing.
226. For those who take
An oath for abstention
From their wives,
A waiting for four months
Is ordained;
If then they return,
God is Oft-forgiving,
Most Merciful.
227. But if their intention
Is firm for divorce,
God heareth
And knoweth all things.
228. Divorced women 
Shall wait concerning themselves
For three monthly periods.
Nor is it lawful for them
To hide what God
Hath created in their wombs,
If they have faith
In God and the Last Day.
And their husbands
Have the better right
To take them back
In that period, if
They wish for reconciliation.
And women shall have rights
Similar to the rights
Against them, according
To what is equitable; 
But men have a degree
(Of advantage) over them
And God is Exalted in Power
Wise.”
20‘Verse’ 224, has a reference to many special kinds of oaths
practised amongst Arabs.  Some of the oaths even related to
matters  concerning  sex.  These  oaths  caused
misunderstanding, alienation, division or separation between
husbands  and  wives.   ‘Verses’  224  to  227  are  pointed
references to such  oaths.   Through  ‘verse’  224, the  Quran
ordains in general terms, that no one should make an oath – in
the name of God, as an excuse for not doing the right thing, or
for refraining from doing something which will bring people
together.  The text relied upon suggests, that ‘verses’ 225 to
227 should be read together with ‘verse’ 224.  ‘Verse’ 224 is
general and leads up to the next three ‘verses’.  These ‘verses’
are in the context of existing customs, which were very unfair
to  married  women.   Illustratively,  it  was  sought  to  be
explained,  that  in  a  fit  of  anger  or  caprice,  sometimes  a
husband would take an oath – in the name of God, not to
approach his wife.  This act of the husband, it was sought to
be explained, deprives the wife of her conjugal rights, and yet,
keeps her tied to the husand indefinitely, inasmuch as, she
has no right to remarry.  Even if this act of the husband, was
protested by the wife, the explanation provided is, that the
husband  was  bound  –  by  the  oath  in  the  name  of  God.
Through the above verses, the Quran disapproves thoughtless
oaths, and at the same time, insists on a proper solemn and
21conscious/purposeful oath, being scrupulously observed.  The
above ‘verses’ caution  husbands to understand, that an oath
in the name of God was not a valid excuse – since God looks at
intention,  and  not  mere  thoughtless  words.  It  is  in  these
circumstances, that ‘verses’ 226 and 227 postulate, that the
husband and  wife  in a difficult relationship, are allowed a
period of four months, to determine whether an adjustment is
possible.  Even though reconciliation is recommended, but if
the couple is against reconciliation, the Quran ordains, that it
is unfair to keep the wife tied to her husband indefinitely.  The
Quran accordingly suggests, that in such a situation, divorce is
the  only  fair  and  equitable  course.   All  the  same  it  is
recognized, that divorce is the most hateful action, in the sight
of the God.  
(iii)‘Verses’ 229 to 231 contained in ‘section’ 29 of ‘sura’ II,
and ‘verses’ 232 and 233 included in ‘section’ 30 of ‘sura’ II, as
also  ‘verse’  237  contained  in  ‘section’  31  in  ‘sura’  II,  are
relevant on the issue of divorce.  The same are extracted below:
“229. A divorce is only 
Permissible twice: after that, 
The parties should either hold
Together on equitable terms,
Or separate with kindness.
It is not lawful for you,
(Men), to take back
Any of your gifts (from your wives), 
Except when both parties
Fear that they would be 
Unable to keep the limits
Ordained by God.
22If ye (judges) do indeed 
Fear that they would be
Unable to keep the limits 
Ordained by God,
There  is no blame on either
Of them if she give
Something for her freedom.
These are the limits 
Ordained by God;
So do not transgress them
If any do transgress
The limits ordained by God,
Such persons wrong
(Themselves as well as others)
230.So if a husband
Divorces his wife (irrevocably),
He cannot, after that,
Re-marry her until
After she has married
Another husband and 
He has divorced her.
In that case there is
No blame on either of them
If they re-unite, provided
They feel that they
Can keep the limits
Ordained by God.
Such are the limits
Ordained by God,
Which He makes plain
To those who understand.
231.When ye divorce
Women, and they fulfil
The term of their (‘Iddat’)
Either taken them back
On equitable terms
Or set them free
On equitable terms;
But do not take them back
To injure them, (or) to take
Undue advantage;
If any one does that,
He wrongs his own soul.
Do not treat God’s Signs
As a jest,
But solemnly rehearse
God’s favours on you,
And the fact that He
23Send down to you
The Book
And Wisdom,
For your instruction.
And fear God,
And know that God
Is well acquainted
With all things.”
A perusal of the aforesaid ‘verses’ reveals, that divorce for the
reason of mutual incompatibility is allowed. There is however a
recorded word of caution – that the parties could act in haste
and then repent, and thereafter again reunite, and yet again,
separate.  To prevent erratic and fitful repeated separations
and reunions, a limit of two divorces is prescribed.  In other
words, reconciliation after two divorces is allowed.  After the
second divorce, the parties must definitely make up their mind,
either to dissolve their ties permanently, or to live together
honourably, in mutual love and forbearance – to hold together
on equitable terms.  However, if separation is inevitable even
on  reunion  after  the  second  divorce,  easy  reunion  is  not
permitted.  The husband and wife are forbidden from casting
aspersions on one another.  They are mandated to recognize,
what is right and honourable, on a collective consideration of
all circumstances.  After the divorce, a husband cannot seek
the return of gifts or properties, he may have given to his wife.
Such retention by the wife is permitted, only in recognition that
the wife is economically weaker.  An exception has been carved
24out in the second part of ‘verse’ 229, that in situations where
the freedom of the wife could suffer on account of the husband
refusing to dissolve the marriage, and perhaps, also treat her
with cruelty.  It is permissible for the wife, in such a situation,
to  extend  some  material  consideration  to  the  husband.
Separation of this kind, at the instance of the wife, is called
‘khula’.  ‘Verse’ 230 is in continuation of the first part of ‘verse’
229.   The  instant  ‘verse’  recognizes  the  permissibility  of
reunion after two divorces.  When divorce is pronounced for
the  third  time,  between  the  same  parties,  it  becomes
irreversible, until the woman marries some other man and he
divorces her (or is otherwise released from the matrimonial tie,
on account of his death).  The Quranic expectation in ‘verse’
230, requires the husband to restrain himself, from dissolving
the matrimonial tie, on a sudden gust of temper or anger.
‘Verse’ 231 provides, that a man who takes back his wife after
two divorces, must not put pressure on her, to prejudice her
rights in any way.  Remarriage must only be on equitable
terms, whereupon, the husband and wife are expected to lead a
clean  and  honourable  life,  respecting  each  other’s
personalities.   The  Quranic  message  is,  that  the  husband
should either take back the wife on equitable terms, or should
set her free with kindness. 
25(iv)The ‘verses’ referred to above need to be understood
along with ‘verses’ 232 and 233, contained in ‘section’ 20 of
‘sura’ II, of the Quran.  The above two ‘verses’ are extracted
below:
“232. When ye divorce
Women, and they fulfil
The term of their (‘Iddat’),
Do not prevent them
From marrying
Their (former) husbands,
If they mutually agree
On equitable terms.
This instruction
Is for all amongst you,
Who believe in God
And the Last Day.
That is (the course Making for) more virtue
And purity amongst you,
And God knows,
And ye know not.
233. The mothers shall give suck
To their offspring
For two whole years,
If the father desires
To complete the term.
But he shall bear the cost
Of their food and clothing
On equitable terms.
No soul shall have
A  burden laid on it
Greater than it can bear.
No mother shall be
Treated unfairly
On account of his child,
An heir shall be chargeable
In the same way.
If they both decide
On weaning,
By mutual consent,
And after due consultation,
There is no blame on them.
If ye decide
 On a foster-mother
For your offspring,
26There is no blame on you,
Provided ye pay (the mother)
What ye offered,
On equitable terms.
But fear God and know
That God sees well
What ye do.”
A perusal of the above ‘verses’ reveals, that the termination of
the contract of marriage, is treated as a serious matter for
family and social life.  And as such, every lawful advice, which
can bring back those who had lived together earlier, provided
there is mutual love and they can live with each other on
honourable terms, is commended.  After following the above
parameters, the Quran ordains, that it is not right for outsiders
to prevent the reunion of the husband and wife.  ‘Verse’ 233 is
in the midst of the regulations on divorce.  It applies primarily
to cases of divorce, where some definite rule is necessary, as
the  father  and  mother  would  not,  on  account  of  divorce,
probably be on good terms, and the interest of children must
be safeguarded.  Since the language of ‘verse’ 233 is general,
the edict contained therein is interpreted, as applying equally
to the father and mother, inasmuch as, each must fulfil his or
her part, in the fostering of children.  
(v)The last relevant ‘verse’ in ‘sura’ II of the Quran, is
contained in ‘section’ 31, namely, ‘verse’ 237.  The same is
reproduced below:
“237. And if ye divorce them
Before consummation,
27But after the fixation
Of a dower for them,
Then the half of the dower 
(Is due to them), unless
They remit it
Or (the man’s half) is remitted
By him in whose hands
IIs the marriage tie;
And the remission
(Of the man’s half)
Is the nearest to righteousness.
And do not forget
Liberality between yourselves.
For God sees well
All that ye do.”
In  case  of  divorce  before  consummation  of  marriage,  it  is
recognized,  that  only  half  the  dower  fixed  needed  to  be
refunded to the wife.  It is however open to the wife, to remit
the half due to her.  And likewise, it is open to the husband to
remit the half which he is entitled to deduct (and thus pay the
whole dower amount).
19.Reference  is  also  necessary  to  ‘verses’  34  and  35,
contained in ‘section’ 6, as well as, ‘verse’ 128 contained in
‘section’ 19, of ‘sura’ IV.  All the above verses are extracted
below:
“34. Men are the protectors
And maintainers of women,
Because God has given 
The one more (strength)
Than the other, and because
They support them
From their means.
Therefore the righteous women
Are devoutly obedient, and guard
In (the husband’s) absence
What God would have them
guard.
28As to those women
On whose part ye fear
Disloyalty and ill-conduct,
Admonish them (first),
(Next), refuse to share their beds,
(And last) beat them (lightly); 
But if they return to obedience,
Seek not against them
Means (of annoyance):
For God is Most High,
Great (above you all).
3. If ye fear a breach
Between them twain,
Appoint (two) arbiters,
One from his family,
And the other from hers;
If they wish for peace, 
God will cause
Their reconciliation:
For God hath full knowledge,
And is acquainted
With all things.”
Section 19, Sura IV
“128.If a wife fears
Cruelty or desertion
On her husband’s part,
There is no blame on them,
If they arrange
An amicable settlement
Between themselves;
And such settlement is best;
Even though men’s souls 
Are swayed by greed.
But if ye do good
And practice self-restraint
God is well-acquainted
With all that ye do.”
The Quran declares men as protectors, and casts a duty on
them to maintain their women.  In order to be entitled to the
husband’s  support,  the  Quran  ordains  the  women  to  be
righteous, and to be devoutly obedient to the husband, even in
his absence. ‘Verse’ 34, extends to the husband the right to
29admonish  his  wife  who  is  either  disloyal,  or  ill-conducts
herself.  Such admonition can be by refusing to share her bed,
and as a last resort, even to beat her lightly.  Thereafter, if the
woman does not return to obedience, the husband is advised
not to use means of annoyance against her.  ‘Verse’ 35, sets
out the course of settlement of family disputes.  It postulates
the  appointment  of  two  arbitrators  –  one  representing  the
family of the husband, and the other the family of the wife.
The  arbitrators  are  mandated  to  explore  the  possibility  of
reconciliation.   In  case  reconciliation  is  not  possible,
dissolution is advised, without publicity or mud-throwing or by
resorting to trickery or deception.  ‘Verse’ 128 provides for
divorce at the instance of the wife – ‘khula’.  It provides for a
situation  where,  the  wife  fears  cruelty  or  desertion  on  her
husband’s part.  In such a situation, her desire to seek an
amicable settlement, cannot be treated as an aspersion on her.
The couple must then settle to separate, on most amicable
terms.  The husband is cautioned not to be greedy.  He is
required to protect the wife’s economic interest.  In case of
disputation  between  the  couple,  for  economic  reasons,  the
Quran  ordains,  that  sanctity  of  the  marriage  itself,  is  far
greater than any economic interest, and accordingly suggests,
that  if  separation  can  be  prevented  by  providing  some
economic consideration to the wife, it is better for the husband
30to make such a concession, than to endanger the future of the
wife and children.  
20.The last relevant ‘verses’ – 1 and 2, are contained in
‘section’ 1 of ‘sura’ – LXV.  The same are reproduced below:
“1. Prophet! When ye
Do divorce women,
Divorce them at their
Prescribed periods,
And count (accurately)
Their prescribed periods:
And fear God your Lord:
And turn them not out 
Of their houses, nor shall
They (themselves) leave,
Except in case they are
Guilty of some open lewdness,
Those are limits
Set by God: and any
Who transgresses the limits
Of God, does verily 
Wrong his (own) soul:
Thou knowest not if
Perchance God will
Bring about thereafter
Some new situation.
2.Thus when they fulfil
Their term appointed, 
Either take them back
On equitable terms
Or part with them
On equitable terms;
And take for witness
Two persons from among you,
Endued with justice,
And establish the evidence 
(As) before God.  Such
Is the admonition given 
To him who believes
In God and the Last Day.
And for those who fear
God, He (ever) prepares
A way out,”
31'‘Verse’ 1 above, it may be noticed, has reference to the Prophet
Muhammad himself.  It is addressed in his capacity as teacher
and representative of the community.  It endorses the view,
that of all things permitted, divorce is the most hateful in the
sight of the God.  Even though, the ‘verse’ provides for divorce,
it proscribes the husband from turning out his wife/wives from
his house.  It also forbids the wife/wives, to leave the house of
their  husband,  except  when  they  are  guilty.   Those  who
transgress the above limitation, are cautioned, that they are
committing  wrong  to  their  own  souls.   Reconciliation  is
suggested, whenever it is possible. It is recommended at every
stage.  The first serious difference between the spouses is first
to be submitted to a family counsel, on which both sides are to
be  represented.    The  ‘verse’  requires  the  divorce  to  be
pronounced,  only  after  the  period  of  prohibitory  waiting.
‘Dower’ has to be paid, and due provisions have to be made, by
the husband, for many things on equitable terms.  On each
aspect,  there  is  to  be  consideration.  Reconciliation  is
recommended till the last moment.  The message contained in
‘verse’  2  is,  that  everything  should  be  done  fairly,  and  all
interests  should  be  safeguarded.   It  is  ordained,  that  the
parties should remember, that such matters affect the most
intimate aspect of their lives, and therefore, have a bearing
even in the spiritual kingdom.  It is therefore, that the ‘verses’
32extracted  above,  impress  on  the  parties,  to  fear  God,  and
ensure that their determination is just and true.
21.The  understanding  of  the  ‘verses’  of  the  Quran,  is
imperative  in  this  case,  because  the  petitioner  and  those
supporting  the  petitoner’s  case  contend  inter  alia,  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’,  is  not in  conformity with  the  unambiguous
edicts of the Quran, and therefore, cannot be considered as
valid constituents of Muslim ‘personal law’.
Part-4.
Legislation in India, in the field of Muslim ‘personal law’ :
22.It  would  be  relevant  to  record,  that  ‘personal  law’
dealing with the affairs of those professing the Muslim religion,
was also regulated by custom or usage.  It was also regulated
by ‘Shariat’ – the Muslim ‘personal law’.  The status of Muslim
women under customs and usages adopted by Muslims, were
considered  to  be  oppressive  towards  women.   Prior  to  the
independence  of  India,  Muslim  women  organisations
condemned customary law, as it adversely affected their rights,
under the ‘Shariat’.  Muslim women claimed, that the Muslim
‘personal law’ be made applicable to them.  It is therefore, that
the  Muslim  Personal  Law  (Sharait)  Application  Act,  1937
(hereinafter referred to, as the Shariat Act), was passed.  It is
essential to understand, the background which resulted in the
33enactment of the Shariat Act.  The same is recorded in the
statement of objects and reasons, which is reproduced below:
“For several years past it has been the cherished desire of
the Muslims of British India that Customary Law should
in no case take the place of Muslim Personal Law . The
matter has been repeatedly agitated in the press as well as
on the platform. The Jamiat-ul-Ulema-i-Hind, the greatest
Moslem  religious  body  has  supported  the  demand  and
invited  the  attention  of  all  concerned  to  the  urgent
necessity  of  introducing  a  measure  to  this  effect .
Customary Law is a misnomer inasmuch as it has not any
sound basis to stand upon and is very much liable to
frequent changes and cannot be expected to attain at any
time in the future that certainty and definiteness which
must  be  the  characteristic  of  all  laws.  The  status  of
Muslim  women  under  the  so-called  Customary  Law  is
simply disgraceful. All the Muslim Women Organisations
have  therefore  condemned  the  Customary  Law  as  it
adversely  affects  their  rights.  They  demand  that  the
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) should be made applicable
to them. The introduction of Muslim Personal Law will
automatically raise them to the position to which they are
naturally entitled . In addition to this present measure, if
enacted,  would  have  very  salutary  effect  on  society
because it would ensure certainty and definiteness in the
mutual  rights  and  obligations  of  the  public.  Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat) exists in the form of a veritable
code and is too well known to admit of any doubt or to
entail any great labour in the shape of research, which is
the chief feature of Customary Law.”
23.Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Shariat Act are relevant and
are extracted hereunder:
“2  Application  of  personal  law  to  Muslims.-
Notwithstanding any customs or usage to the contrary, in
all questions (save questions relating to agricultural land)
regarding intestate succession, special property of females,
including personal property inherited or obtained under
contract or gift or any other provision of Personal Law,
marriage,  dissolution  of  marriage,  including  talaq,  ila,
zihar,  lian,  khula  and  mubaraat ,  maintenance,  dower,
guardianship, gifts, trusts and trust properties, and wakfs
(other  than  charities  and  charitable  institutions  and
charitable and religious endowments) the rule of decision
34in  cases  where  the  parties  are  Muslims  shall  be  the
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) .”
3.  Power  to  make  a  declaration. -  (1)  Any  person  who
satisfies the prescribed authority-
(a) that he is a Muslim, and 
(b) that he is competent to contract within the meaning of
section 11 of the  Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), and 
(c) that he is a resident of the territories to which this Act
extends,
may by declaration in the prescribed form and filed before
the prescribed authority declare that he desires to obtain
the benefit of the provisions of this section, and thereafter
the provisions of section 2 shall apply to the declarant and
all  his  minor  children  and  their  descendants  as  if  in
addition to the matters enumerated therein adoption, wills
and legacies were also specified.
(2)  Where  the  prescribed  authority  refuses  to  accept  a
declaration under sub-section (1), the person desiring to make
the same may appeal to such officer as the Government may,
by general or special order, appoint in this behalf, and such
officer may, if he is satisfied that the appellant is entitled to
make the declaration, order the prescribed authority to accept
the same.

5.  Dissolution  of  marriage  by  Court  in  certain
circumstances.-The District Judge may, on petition made by a
Muslim married woman, dissolve a marriage on any ground
recognized by Muslim Personal Law (Shariat).”
A close examination of Section 2, extracted above, leaves no
room  for  any  doubt,  that  custom  and  usage,  as  it  existed
amongst Muslims, were sought to be expressly done away with,
to the extent the same were contrary to Muslim ‘personal law’.
Section 2 also mandated, that Muslim ‘personal law’ (Shariat)
would be exclusively adopted as “… the rule of decision …” in
matters of intestate succession, special property of females,
including  all  questions  pertaining  to  “…  personal  property
inherited  or  obtained  under  contract  or  gift  or  any  other
35provision of ‘personal law’, marriage, dissolution of marriage,
including  talaq,  ila,  zihar,  lian,  khula  and  mubaraat,
maintenance,  dower,  gifts,  trusts  and  trust  properties,  and
wakfs …”.  Section 3 added to the above list, “… adoption, wills
and  legacies  …”,  subject  to  the  declaration  expressed  in
Section 3.
24.It is relevant to highlight herein, that under Section 5
of the Shariat Act provided, that a Muslim woman could seek
dissolution of her marriage, on the grounds recognized under
the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’.   It  would  also  be  relevant  to
highlight, that Section 5 of the Shariat Act was deleted, and
replaced by the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.
25.In the above context, it would be relevant to mention,
that there was no provision in the Hanafi Code, of Muslim law
for a married Muslim woman, to seek dissolution of marriage,
as of right.  Accordingly, Hanafi jurists had laid down, that in
cases in which the application of Hanafi law caused hardship,
it was permissible to apply the principles of the Maliki, Shafii
or  Hanbali  law .   This  position  was  duly  noticed  in  the
introduction to the 1939 Act, as well as, in the statement of its
objects  and  reasons.   Be  that  as  it  may,  the  alternatives
suggested  by  the  Hanafi  jurists  were  not  being  applied  by
courts.   Accordingly,  in  order  to  crystalise  the  grounds  of
dissolution of marriage, by a Muslim woman, the 1939 Act,
36was enacted.  The statement of objects and reasons of the
above  enactment  is  relevant,  and  is  accordingly  extracted
hereunder:
““There is no proviso in the Hanafi Code of Muslim Law
enabling a married Muslim woman to obtain a decree from
the Court dissolving her marriage in case the husband
neglects  to  maintain  her,  makes  her  life  miserable  by
deserting  or  persistently  maltreating  her  or  absconds
leaving  her  unprovided  for  and  under  certain  other
circumstances.
The absence of such a provision has entailed unspeakable
misery to innumerable Muslim women in British India.
The Hanafi Jurists however, have clearly laid down that in
cases  in  which  the  application  of  Hanafi  Law  causes
hardship, it is permissible to apply the provisions of the
“Maliki, Shafii or Hambali Law”.
Acting on this principle the Ulemas have issued fatwas to
the effect that in cases enumerated in clause 3, Part A of
this Bill (now see section 2 of the Act), a married Muslim
woman may obtain a decree dissolving her marriage. A
lucid exposition of this principle can be found in the book
called “Heelatun Najeza” published by Maulana Ashraf Ali
Sahib who has made an exhaustive study of the provisions
of Maliki Law which under the circumstances prevailing in
India  may  be  applied  to  such  cases.   This  has  been
approved by a large number of Ulemas who have put their
seals of approval on the book.
As the Courts are sure to hesitate to apply the Maliki Law
to the case of a Muslim woman, legislation recognizing and
enforcing the above mentioned principle is called for in
order to relieve the sufferings of countless Muslim women.
One more point remains in connection with the dissolution
of marriages.  It is this.  The Courts in British India have
held in a number of cases that the apostasy of a married
Muslim  woman  ipso  facto  dissolves  her  marriage.  This
view has been repeatedly challenged at the bar, but the
Courts continue to stick to precedents created by rulings
based  on  an  erroneous  view  of  the  Muslim  Law.   The
Ulemas have issued Fatwas supporting non-dissolution of
marriage  by  reason  of  wife’s  apostasy.   The  Muslim
community has, again and again, given expression to its
supreme dissatisfaction with the view held by the Courts.
Any number of articles have been appearing in the press
demanding legislation to rectify the mistake committed by
37the Courts; hence clause 5 (now see section 4) is proposed
to be incorporated in this Bill.
Thus, by this Bill the whole Law relating to dissolution of
marriages is brought at one place and consolidated in the
hope that it would supply a very long felt want of the
Muslim Community in India”.
26.The  Dissolution  of  Muslim  Marriages  Act,  1939
provided, the grounds on which a Muslim woman, could seek
dissolution  of  marriage.  Section  2  of  the  enactment  is
reproduced below:
“2.  Grounds  for  decree  for  dissolution  of  marriage.—A
woman  married  under  Muslim  law  shall  be  entitled  to
obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on any
one or more of the following grounds, namely:— 
(i) that the whereabouts of the husband have not been
known for a period of four years;
(ii) that the husband has neglected or has failed to provide
for her maintenance for a period of two years;
(iii) that the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment
for a period of seven years or upwards; 
(iv) that  the  husband  has  failed  to  perform,  without
reasonable cause, his marital obligations for a period of
three years;
(v)  that  the  husband  was  impotent  at  the  time  of  the
marriage and continues to be so;
(vi) that the husband has been insane for a period of two
years  or  is  suffering  from  leprosy  or  virulent  venereal
disease;
(vii) that she, having been given in marriage by her father
or other guardian before she attained the age of fifteen
years, repudiated the marriage before attaining the age of
eighteen years:
Provided that the marriage has not been consummated; 
(viii) that the husband treats her with cruelty, that is to
say,—
(a) habitually assaults her or makes her life miserable by
cruelty of conduct even if such conduct does not amount
to physical ill-treatment, or 
(b)  associates  with  women  of  evil  repute  or  leads  an
infamous life, or 
(c) attempts to force her to lead an immoral life, or
(d) disposes of her property or prevents her exercising her
legal rights over it, or
38(e)  obstructs  her  in  the  observance  of  her  religious
profession or practice, or 
(f)  if  he  has  more  wives  than  one,  does  not  treat  her
equitably in accordance with the injunctions of the Quran;
(ix) on any other ground which is recognised as valid for
the dissolution of marriages under Muslim law:
Provided that—
(a) no  decree  shall  be  passed  on  ground  (iii)  until  the
sentence has become final;
(b) a decree passed on ground (i) shall not take effect for a
period of six months from the date of such decree, and if
the  husband  appears  either  in  person  or  through  an
authorised agent within that period and satisfies the Court
that he is prepared to perform his conjugal duties, the
Court shall set aside the said decree; and 
(c) before passing a decree on ground (v) the Court shall,
on application by the husband, make an order requiring
the husband to satisfy the Court within a period of one
year from the date of such order that he has ceased to be
impotent, and if the husband so satisfies the Court within
such  period,  no  decree  shall  be  passed  on  the  said
ground.”
27.  We may record here, that the Dissolution of Muslim
Marriages Act, 1939, is irrelevant for the present controversy
on account of the fact, that the issue in hand does not pertain
to the dissolution of marriage at the behest of a Muslim wife
(but pertains to the dissolution of marriage, at the behest of a
Muslim husband).  The provisions of the instant enactment are
relevant, to understand the submissions advanced by  learned
counsel, representing the petitioners, as also the respondents,
based on their individual perspectives.

Abrogation of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by legislation, the 
world over, in Islamic, as well as, non-Islamic States :
3928.‘Muslim Law in India and Abroad’, by Tahir Mahmood
and Saif Mahmood (Universal Law Publishing Co. Pvt. Ltd.,
New Delhi, 2012 edition), records the following position about
the abrogation of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as a means of
divorce, through statutory enactments, the world over.  The
countries  which  have  abolished  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  have  been
divided  into  Arab  States,  Southeast  Asian  States,  and
Subcontinental  States.   We  have  maintained  the  above
classifications,  in  order  to  establish  their  factual  positions.

secondly, that the practice has been done away with, by way of
legislation, in the countries referred to below.

a lump sum within one year from the former husband’s
death the indemnity claimable by her.

for in the decree, which shall be non-appealable but can
be reviewed for making additional provisions.

matters of divorce and all concerning matters including
the compensation money to which the divorced wife may
be entitled after the expiry of Iddat.   The  portions  of  the

Part-6.
Judicial pronouncements, on the subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’:
5430. Rashid Ahmad v. Anisa Khatun      1      .   
(i) The facts:The primary issue that came to be adjudicated in the above
case,  pertained  to  the  validity  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  pronounced  by
Ghiyas-ud-din, a Sunni Mohomedan of the Hanafi school, to his wife Anisa
Khatun  –  respondent  no.1.   The  marriage  of  the  respondent  with
Ghiyas-ud-din had taken place on 28.08.1905. Ghiyas-ud-din divorced her
on or about 13.09.1905.  Ghiyas-ud-din pronounced triple talaq, in the
presence of witnesses, though in the absence of his wife – Anisa Khatun.
Respondent no.1 – Anisa Khatun received Rs.1,000 in payment of ‘dower’ on
the same day, which was confirmed by a registered receipt.  Thereafter,
Ghiyas-ud-din executed a ‘talaqnama’ (decree of divorce) dated 17.09.1905,
which narrates the divorce.  The ‘talaqnama’ is alleged to have been given to
Anisa Khatun – respondent no.1.
(ii)  The challenge:Anisa  Khatun  –  respondent  no.1,  challenged  the
validity of the divorce, firstly, for the reason, that she was not present at the
1 AIR 1932 PC 25
55time  of  pronouncement  of  divorce.   And  secondly,  that  even  after  the
aforestated pronouncement, cohabitation had continued and subsisted for a
further period of fifteen years, i.e., till the death of Ghiyas-ud-din.  In the
interregnum, five children were born to Ghiyas-ud-din and Anisa Khatun.
According to Anisa Khatun, Ghiyas-ud-din continued to treat Anisa Khatun
–  respondent  no.1,  as  his  wife,  and  the  children  born  to  her,  as  his
legitimate children.  It was also the case of respondent no.1, that the
payment of Rs.1,000, was a payment of prompt dower, and as such, not
payment  in  continuation  of  the  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  pronounced  by
Ghiyas-ud-din.  
(iii) The consideration :While considering the validity of the ‘talaq-e-biddat’
pronounced on 13.09.1905, and the legitimacy of the children born to Anisa
Khatun, the Privy Council held as under:
“15. Their Lordships are of opinion that the pronouncement of the triple
talak by Ghiyas-ud-din constituted an immediately effective divorce , and,
while they are satisfied that the High Court were not justified in such a
conclusion on the evidence in the present case, they are of opinion that
the validity and effectiveness of the divorce would not be affected by
Ghiyas-ud-din’s mental intention that it should not be a genuine divorce,
as such a view is contrary to all authority. A talak actually pronounced
under compulsion or in jest is valid and effective : Baillie’s Digest, 2nd
edn., p. 208; Ameer Ali's Mohammedan Law, 3rd edn., vol. ii, p. 518;
Hamilton's Hedaya, vol. i, p. 211.
16. The respondents sought to   found   on the admitted fact that for about
fifteen years after the divorce Ghiyas-ud-din treated Anisa Fatima as his
wife and his children as legitimate, and on certain admissions of their
status said to have been made by appellant No. 1 and respondent pro
forma No. 10, who are brothers of Ghiyas-ud-din, but once the divorce is
held proved such facts could not undo its effect or confer such a status
on the respondents .
17. While admitting that, upon divorce by the triple talak, Ghiyas-ud-din
could not lawfully remarry Anisa Fatima until she had married another
and the latter had divorced her or died, the respondents maintained that
the acknowledgment of their legitimacy by Ghiyas-ud-din, subsequent to
the divorce, raised the presumption that Anisa Fatima had in the interval
56married another, who had died or divorced her, and that Ghiyas-ud-din
had married her again, and that it was for the appellants to displace that
presumption. In support of this contention, they founded on certain dicta
in the judgment of this Board in  Habibur Rahman Chowdhury v. Altaf Ali
Chowdhury L.R. 48 I.A. 114. Their Lordships find it difficult to regard
this contention as a serious one, for these dicta directly negative it. The
passage  relied  on,  which  related  to  indirect  proof  of  Mahomedan
marriage by acknowledgment of a son as a legitimate son is as follows: “It
must not be impossible upon the face of it, i.e., it must not be made
when  the  ages  are  such  that  it  is  impossible  in  nature  for  the
acknowledgor to be the father of the acknowledgee, or when the mother
spoken to in an acknowledgment, being the wife of another, or within
prohibited degrees of the  acknowledgor, it would be apparent that the
issue would be the issue of adultery  or incest. The acknowledgment may
be repudiated by the acknowledgee. But if none of these objections occur,
then the acknowledgment has more than evidential value. It raises a
presumption of marriage – a presumption which may be taken advantage
of  either  by  a  wife-claimant  or  a  son-claimant.  Being,  however,  a
presumption of fact, and not juris et de jure, it is, like every other
presumption of fact capable of being set aside by contrary proof.
18. The legal bar to re-marriage created by the divorce in the present
case  would  equally  prevent  the  raising  of  the  presumption.  If  the
respondents had proved the removal of that bar by proving the marriage
of Anisa Fatima to another after the divorce and the death of the latter or
his  divorce  of  her  prior  to  the  birth  of  the  children  and  their
acknowledgment as legitimate, the respondents might then have had the
benefit of the presumption, but not otherwise.
19. Their Lordships are, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be
allowed, that the decree of the High Court should be reversed, and that
the decree of the Subordinate Judge should be restored, the appellants
to have the costs of his appeal and their costs in the High Court. Their
Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly.”
(iv)  The conclusion :  The Privy Council, upheld as valid, ‘talaq-e-biddat’ –
triple talaq, pronounced by the husband, in the absence and without the
knowledge of the wife, even though the husband and wife continued to
cohabit for 15 long years thereafter, wherefrom 5 offsprings were born to
them
31. Jiauddin  Ahmed  v.  Anwara  Begum      2      ,  (Single  Judge  judgment,
authored by Baharul Islam, J., as he then was   ). 
2 (1981) 1 Gau.L.R. 358
57(i) The facts  :The  respondent  –  Anwara  Begum  had  petitioned  for
maintenance, under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Her
contention was, that she had lived with her husband for about 9 months,
after her marriage.  During that period, her marriage was consummated.
Anwara Begum alleged, that after the above period, her husband began to
torture her, and even used to beat her.  It was therefore, that she was
compelled to leave his company, and start living with her father, who was
a  day  labourer.   Maintenance  was  duly  granted,  by  the  First  Class
Magistrate, Tinsukia.  Her husband, the petitioner – Jiauddin Ahmed,
contested  the  respondent’s  claim  for  maintenance,  before  the  Gauhati
High Court, on the ground that he had divorced her, by pronouncing
divorce by adopting the procedure of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.   
(iii)  The challenge   :  It is in the above circumstances, that the validity of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, and the wife’s entitlement to maintenance came to be
considered by the Guahati High Court, which examined the validity of the
concept of ‘talaq-e-biddat’. 
(iv) The consideration   : (a) The High Court placed reliance on ‘verses’ 128
to 130, contained in ‘section’ 19, of ‘sura’ IV, and ‘verses’ 229 to 232,
contained in ‘sections’ 29 and 30 of ‘sura’ II, and thereupon, referred to
the commentary on the above verses by scholars (Abdullah Yusuf Ali and
Maulana Mohammad Ali) and the views of jurists (Ameer Ali and Fyzee),
with pointed reference to ‘talaq’ , which was narrated as under:
“Islam tried to maintain the married state as far as possible, especially
where children are concerned, but it is against the restriction of the
liberty of men and women in such vitally important matters as love and
family life. It will check hasty action as far as possible and leave the door
58to reconciliation open at many stages. Even after divorce a suggestion of
reconciliation is made, subject to certain precautions against thoughtless
action.  A  period  of  waiting  (Iddat)  for  three  monthly  courses  is
prescribed, in order to see if the marriage conditionally dissolved is likely
to result in issue. But this is not necessary where the divorced woman is
a virgin. It is definitely declared that women and men shall have similar
rights against each other.
Yusuf Ali has further observed:
""Where divorce for mutual incompatibility is allowed, there is danger that
the parties might act hastily, then repent, and again wish to separate. To
prevent such capricious action repeatedly, a limit is prescribed. Two
divorces  (with  a  reconciliation  between)  are  allowed.   After  that  the
parties must unitedly make up their minds, either to dissolve their union
permanently, or to live honourable lives together in mutual love and for -
bearance to 'hold together on equitable terms, 'neither party worrying the
other  nor  grumbling  nor  evading  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of
marriage''.
Yusuf Ali proceeds:
""All the prohibitions and limits prescribed here are in the interests of
good and honourable lives for both sides, and in the interests of a clean
and honourable social life, without public or private scandals...""
*  *  *  *
""Two divorces followed by re-union are permissible; the third time the
divorce becomes irrevocable, until the woman marries some other man
and he divorces her. This is to set an almost impossible condition. The
lesson is: if a man loves a woman he should not allow a sudden gust of
temper or anger to induce him to take hasty action...
If the man takes back his wife after two divorces, he must do so only on
equitable terms, i.e. he must not put pressure on the woman to prejudice
her rights in any way, and they must live clean and honourable lives,
respecting each other's personalities...""
The learned Commentator further observes :
""The termination of a marriage bond is a most serious matter for family
and social life. An every lawful device is approved which can equitably
bring back those who have lived together, provided only there is mutual
love and they can live on honourable terms with each other. If these
conditions are fulfilled, it is no right for out siders to prevent or hinder
re-union. They may be swayed by property or other considerations.""
(b) The  High  Court  also  placed  reliance  on  ‘verse’  35  contained  in
‘section’ 6, of ‘sura’ IV, and again referred to the commentary on the above
‘verse’ (by Abdullah Yusuf Ali), who had  interpreted the same as under:
""An  excellent  plan  for  settling  family  disputes,  without  too  much
publicity or mud-throwing, or resort to the chicaneries of the law. The
Latin countries recognise this plan in their legal system. It is a pity that
59Muslims do not resort to it universally, as they should. The arbiters from
each family would know the idiosyncrasies of both parties, and would be
able, with God's help, effect a real reconciliation.""
Maulana Mohammad Ali  has commented on the above verse thus:
""This verse lays down the procedure to be adopted when a case for
divorce arises. It is not for the husband to put away his wife; it is the
business of the judge to decide the case. Nor should the divorce case be
made too public. The Judge is required to appoint two arbi trators, one
belonging to the wife's family and the other to the husband's. These two
arbitrators will find out the facts but their objective must be to effect a
reconciliation between the parties. If all hopes of reconciliation fail, a
divorce is allowed. But the final decision rests with the judge who is
legally entitled to pronounce a divorce. Cases were decided in accordance
with the directions contained in this verse in the early days of Islam.”
The same learned author commenting on the above verse (IV: 35) in his
the Religion of Islam has observed:
""From what has been said above, it is clear that not only must there be a
good cause for divorce, but that all means to effect reconciliation must
have been exhaus ted before resort is had to this extreme measure. The
impression that a Muslim husband may put away his wife at his mere
caprice, is a grave distortion of the Islamic institution of divorce."" 
Fyzee denounces talaq as ""absurd and unjust"". Abdur Rahim says:
""I may remark that the interpretation of the law of divorce by the jurists,
specially of the Hanafi School, is one flagrant instance where because of
literal  adherence  to  mere  words  and  a  certain  tendency  towards
subtleties  they  have  reached  a  result  in  direct  antagonism  to  the
admitted policy of the law on the subject.""
12. Mohammad Ali  has observed:-
""Divorce is thus discouraged:
'If you hate them (i.e. your wives) it may be that you dislike a thing while
Allah has placed abundant good in it."" Remedies are also suggested to
avoid divorce so long as possible:
""And if you fear a breach between the two (i.e. the husband and the wife),
then appoint a judge from his people and a judge from her people; if they
both desire agreement, Allah will effect harmony between them.
It was due to such teachings of the Holy Quran that the Holy Prophet
declared divorce to be the most hateful of all things permitted....The
mentality of the Muslim is to face the difficulties of the married life along
with its comforts and to avoid disturbing the disruption of the family
relations as long as possible, turning to divorce only as a last resort.""
The learned author has further observed:
""The principle of divorce spoken of in the Holy Quran and which in fact
includes to a greater or less extent all causes, is the decision no longer to
live together as husband and wife. In fact, marriage itself is nothing but
an agreement to live together as husband and wife and when either of
the parties finds him or herself unable to agree to such a life, divorce
must follow. It is not, of course, meant that every disagreement between
60them would lead to divorce; it is only the disagreement to live any more
as husband and wife...”
He then refers to the condition laid down in Sura IV verse 35.
The learned author proceeds:
""The 'shiqaq' or breach of the marriage agreement may also arise from
the conduct of either party; for in stance, if either of them misconducts
himself or herself, or either of them is consistently cruel to the other, or,
as may sometimes happen there is incompatibility of temperament to
such an extent that they cannot live together in marital agreement.
The 'shiqaq' in these cases is more express, but still it will depend upon
the parties whether they can pull on or not. Divorce must always follow
when one of the parties finds it impossible to continue the marriage
agreement and is compelled to break it off. At first sight it may look like
giving too much latitude to the parties to allow them to end the marriage
contract  thus,  even  if  there  is  no  reason  except  incompatibility  of
temperament, but this much is certain that if there is such disagreement
that the husband and the wife cannot pull together, it is better for
themselves, for their offspr ing and for society in general that they should
be separated than that they should be compelled to live toge ther. No
home is worth the name wherein instead of peace there is wrangling; and
marriage is meaningless if there is no spark of love left between the
husband and the wife. It is an error to suppose that such lati tude tends
to destroy the stability of marriage, because marriage is entered into as a
permanent and sacred relation based on love between a man and a
woman, and divorce is only a remedy when marriage fails to fulfill its
object.'' 
With regard to the husband's right of pronouncing divorce the learned
author has found;
""Though the Holy Quran speaks of the divorce being pronounced by the
husband, yet a limitation is placed upon the exercise of this right.""
He then refers to the procedure laid down in Sura IV Verse 35 quoted
above, and says :
""It will be seen that in all disputes between the hus band and the wife,
which it is feared will lead to a breach, two judges are to be appointed
from the respec tive people of the two parties. These judges are required
first to try to reconcile the parties to each other, failing which divorce is
to be effected. Therefore, though it is the husband who pronounces the
divorce, he is as much bound by the decision of the judges, as is the
wife. This shows that the husband cannot repudiate the marriage at will.
The  case  must  first  be  referred  to  two  judges  and  their  decision  is
binding......The  Holy  Prophet  is  reported  to  have  interfered  and
disallowed a divorce pronounced by a husband, restoring the marital
relations (Bu. 68: 2). It was no doubt matter of procedure, but it shows
that the authority constituted by law has the right to interfere in matters
of divorce.""
The learned author has further observed:
""Divorce may be given orally, or in writing, but it must take place in the
presence of witnesses.”
61(iv)  The conclusion :  Based on the Quranic verses referred to above, the
High Court concluded as under:
“13. A perusal of the Quranic verses quoted above and the commentaries
thereon by well-recognized Scholars of great eminence like Mahammad
Ali and Yusuf Ali and the pronounce ments of great jurists like Ameer Ali
and Fyzee completely rule out the observation of Macnaghten that ""there
is no occasion for any particular cause for divorce, and mere whim is
sufficient"", and the observation of Batchelor, J. (ILR 30 Bom. 537) that
""the whimsical and capricious divorce by the husband is good in law,
though bad in theology"". These observations have been based on the
concept that women were chattal  belonging to men, which the Holy
Quran does not brook. Costello, J. In 59 Calcutta 833 has not, with
respect, laid down the correct law of talaq. In my view the correct law of
talaq  as  ordained  by  the  Holy  Quran  is  that  talaq  must  be  for  a
reasonable cause and be preceded by attempts at reconciliation between
the husband and the wife by two arbiters-one from the wife's family the
other from the husband's. If the attempts fail, talaq may be effected.
xxx xxx xxx
16.  In  the  instant  case  the  petitioner  merely  alleged  in  his  written
statement before the Magistrate that he had pronounced talaq to the
opposite party; but he did not examine himself, nor has he adduced any
evidence worth the name to prove 'talaq'. There is no proof of talaq, or its
registration.  Regis tration  of  marriage  and  divorce  under  the  Assam
Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1935 is voluntary, and
unilateral. Mere registration of divorce (or marriage) even if proved, will
not render valid divorce which is otherwise invalid under Muslim Law.”
A perusal  of the conclusion recorded by the High Court, through the
above observations, leaves no room for any doubt, that the ‘talaq-e-biddat’
pronounced by the husband without reasonable cause, and without being
preceded by attempts of reconciliation, and without the involvement of
arbitrators with due representation on behalf of the husband and wife,
would not lead to a valid divorce.  The High Court also concluded, that the
petitioner – Jiauddin Ahmed, had mainly alleged that he had pronounced
talaq, but had not established the factum of divorce by adducing any
cogent evidence.  Having concluded , that the marriage between the parties
62was subsisting, the High Court upheld the order awarding maintenance to
the wife – Anwara Begum.
32.Must.  Rukia  Khatun  v.  Abdul  Khalique  Laskar      3      ,  (Division  Bench
judgment, authored by Baharul Islam, CJ., as he then was)   .
(i) The facts  : Rukia Khatun was married to Abdul Khalique Laskar.  The
couple lived together for about 3 months, after their marriage.  During
that period, the marriage was consummated. Rukia Khatun alleged, that
after the above period, her husband abandoned and neglected her.  She
was allegedly not provided with any maintenance, and as such, had been
living in penury, for a period of about 3 months, before she moved an
application  for  grant  of  maintenance.  The  petitioner’s  application  for
maintenance filed under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
was rejected by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi.  She
challenged  the  order  rejecting  her  claim  of  maintenance,  before  the
3 (1981) 1 Gau. L.R. 375
63Gauhati High Court. The respondent-husband – Abdul Khalique Laskar,
contested the claim for maintenance by asserting, that even though he
had married the petitioner, but he had divorced her on 12.4.1972 by way
of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, and had thereafter even executed a talaknama. The
husband also asserted, that he had paid dower to the petitioner.  The
claim of the petitioner-wife for maintenance was declined on the ground,
that she had been divorced by the respondent-husband.  
(ii) The challenge  :It is in the above circumstances, that the validity of
the  divorce  pronounced  by  the  respondent-husband,  by  way  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, and the wife’s entitlement to maintenance,  came up for
consideration.  
(iii)  The consideration   : The Gauhati High Court recorded the following
observations  in  respect  of  the  validity  of  ‘talaq’  pronounced  by  the
respondent-husband, on 12.4.1972.
“7. The first point to be decided, therefore, is whether the opposite party
divorced the Petitioner. The equivalent of the word 'divorce' is 'talaq' in
Muslim Law. What is valid 'talaq' in Muslim law was considered by one of
us (Baharul Islam, J. as he then was) sitting singly in Criminal Revision
No. 199/77 (supra). The word 'talaq' carries the literal significance of
'freeing' or 'the undoing of knot'. 'Talaq' means divorce of a woman by her
husband. Under the Muslim law marriage is a civil contract. Yet the
rights and responsibilities consequent upon it are of such importance to
the welfare of the society that a high degree of sanctity is attached to it.
But in spite of the sacredness of the character of the marriagetic, Islam
recognizes the necessity in exceptional circumstances of keeping the way
open for its dissolution.
There has been a good deal of misconception of the institution of 'talaq'
under the Muslim law. From the Holy Quran and the Hadis, it appears
that though divorce was permitted, yet the right could be exercised only
under exceptional circumstances. The Holy Prophet is reported to have
said: ""Never did Allah allow anything more hateful to Him than “divorce.”
According to a report of Ibn Umar, the Prophet said: ""With Allah the most
detestable of all things permitted is divorce"". (See the Religion of Islam by
Maulana Muhammed Ali at page 671).
64In the case of Ahmed Kasim Molla v. Khatun Bibi reported in  ILR Cal
833, which has so long been regarded as a leading case on the law of
divorce, Justice Costello held:
“Upon that point (divorce), there are a number of authorities and I have
carefully considered this point as dealt with in the very early authorities
to see whether I am in agreement with the mere recent decisions of the
Courts. I regret that I have to come to the conclusion that at the law
stands at present, any Mohamedan may divorce his wife at his mere
whim and caprice.”
Following  Macnaghten,  J.  who  held:  ""there  is  no  occasion  for  any
particular cause for divorce, and mere whim is sufficient,'' and Batchelor,
J, in case of Sarabai v. Babiabai  (ILR 30 Bombay 537)  Costello, J. held:—
“It is good in law, though bad in theology.”
Ameer Ali, in his Treatise on Mahomedan Law has observed:
“The Prophet pronounced talaq to be a most destable thing before the
Almighty God of all permitted things.
If 'talaq' is given without any reason it is stupidity and ingratitude to
God.”
The learned Author in the same book has also observed
“The  author  of  the  Multeka  (Ibrohim  Halebi)  is  more  concise.  He
says-‘The law gives to the man primarily the power of dissolving the
marriage, if the wife, by her indocility or her bad character, renders the
married  life  unhappy;  but  in  the  absence  of  serious  reasons,  no
Musalman can justify a divorce either in the eyes of the religion or the
law. If he abandons his wife or put her away from simple caprice, he
draws, upon himself the divine anger, for 'the curse of God', said the
Prophet, 'rests on him who repudiates his wife capriciously.”
In ILR Madras 22, a Division Bench of the Madras High Court, consisting
of Munro and Abdur Rahim, JJ., held:
“No doubt an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of the right to dissolve
the marriage is strongly condemned in the Quran and in the reported
saying of the Prophet (Hadith) and is treated as a spiritual offence. But
the impropriety of the husband's conduct would in no way affect the legal
validity of a divorce duly effected by the husband.”
What Munro and Abdur Rahmim, JJ. in  ILR 30 Madras 22  precisely held
was that impropriety of the husband's conduct would in no way affect
the legal validity of a divorce duly effected by the husband. The emphasis
was that a talaq would be valid only if it is effected in accordance with
the Muslim Law.
In ILR 5, Rangoon 18, their Lordships of the Privy Council observed:
“According to that law (the Muslim Law), a husband can effect a divorce
whenever he desires.”
But the Privy Council has not said that the divorce need not be duly
effected or that procedure enjoined by the Quran need not be followed.
8. It is needless to say that Holy Quran is the primary source and is the
weightiest authority on any subject under the Muslim Law. The Single
Judge  in Criminal  Revision No. 199/77 in his  judgment quoted the
relevant verses of the Quran, to deal with divorce. We need not refer to all
65the Verses. It will be sufficient if we refer to only one of them, which is
Sura IV verse 35. It reads:
“If ye fear a breach
Between them twain,
Appoint two arbiters
One from his family,
And the other from hers;
If they wish for peace,
God will cause
Their reconciliation:
For God hath full knowledge,
And is acquainted
With all things.”
From  the  verse  quoted  above,  it  appears  that  there  is  a  condition
precedent which must be complied with before the talaq is effected. The
condition precedent if when the relationship between the husband and
the wife is strained and the husband intends to give 'talaq' to his wife he
must chose an arbiter from his side and the wife an arbiter from her
side, and the arbiters must attempt at reconciliation, with a time gap so
that the passions of the parties may call down and reconciliation may be
possible. If ultimately conciliation is not possible, the husband will be
entitled to give 'talaq'. The 'talaq' must be for good cause and must not
be at the mere desire, sweet will, whim and caprice of the husband. It
must not be secret.
Maulana Mohammad Ali, an eminent Muslim jurist, in his Religion of
Islam, after referring to, and considering, the relevant verses on the
subject has observed:
From what has been said above, it is clear that not only must there be a
good cause for divorce, but that all means to effect reconciliation must
have been exhausted before resort is had to this extreme measure. The
impression that a Muslim husband may put away his wife at his mere
caprice, is a grave distortion of the Islamic institution of divorce.”
The learned Jurist also has observed:
“Divorce must always follow when one of the parties finds it impossible to
continue the marriage agreement and is compelled to break it off.”
9. Costello, J. in  ILR 59 Calcutta 833  (supra) considered the judgments
of Munro and Abdur Rahim, JJ. in  ILR 33 Mad. 22  (supra) and of the
Privy Council in  ILR 5, Rangoon 18, (supra) but he preferred the opinions
of Machaghten and Batchalor, JJ. in  ILR 30 Bombay 537  (supra). The
reason perhaps is, as observed by Krishna Ayer, J. (now of the Supreme
Court) in the case of A. Yusuf Rowther v. Sowramma, reported in AIR
1971 Kerala 261:
“Marginal  distortions  are  inevitable  when  the  Judicial  Committee  in
Downing Street has to interpret Manu and Muhammad of India and
Arabia.  The  soul  of  a  Culture  law  is  largely  the  formalised  and
enforceable expression of a community's culture norms-cannot be fully
understood by alien minds.”
6610.  Krishna  Ayer,  J.,  in  AIR  1971  Kerala  261  (supra)  has  further
observed:
“The view that the Muslim husband enjoys an arbitrary, unilateral power
to  inflict  instant  divorce  does  not  accord  with  Islamic  injunctions...
Indeed, a deeper study of the subject disclosed a surprisingly rational,
realistic and modern law of divorce.... …..”
The learned Judge has further observed:
“It is a popular fallacy that a Muslim male enjoys, under the Quranic
law, Unbridled Authority to liquidate the marriage. The whole Quran
expressly forbids a man to seek pretexts for divorcing his wife, so long as
she remains faithful and obedient to him, 'if they (namely, women) obey
you, then do not seek a way against them' (Quran IV: 34)”
(iv)  The conclusion :  Based on the above consideration  above, the High
Court recorded the following conclusion:
“11. In our opinion the correct law of 'talaq' as ordained by Holy Quran
is: (i) that 'talaq' must be for a reasonable cause; and  (ii) that it must be
preceded by an attempt at reconciliation between the husband and wife
by two arbiters, one chosen by the wife from her family and the other by
the husband from his. If their attempts fail, 'talaq' may be effected . In our
opinion the Single Judge has correctly laid down the law in Criminal
Revision No. 199/77 (supra), and, with respect the Calcutta High Court
in ILR 59 Calcutta 833  and the Bombay High Court in  ILR 30 Bombay
537 have not laid down the correct law.”
A perusal of the consideration extracted above, when examined closely,
reveals that the High Court listed the following essential ingredients of a
valid ‘talaq’ under Muslim law.  Firstly, ‘talaq’ has to be based on good
cause, and must not be at the mere desire, sweet will, whim and caprice
of the husband.  Secondly, it must not be secret.  Thirdly, between the
pronouncement  and  finality,  there  must  be  a  time  gap,  so  that  the
passions  of  the  parties  may  calm  down,  and  reconciliation  may  be
possible. Fourthly, there has to be a process of arbitration (as a means of
reconciliation),  wherein  t he  arbitrators  are  representatives  of  both  the
husband and the wife.  If the above ingredients do not exist, ‘talaq’ – divorce
would be invalid.  For the reason, that the ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq
67pronounced by the respondent-husband – Abdul Khalique Laskar, did not
satisfy all the ingredients for a valid divorce, the High Court concluded that
the marriage was subsisting, and accordingly held the wife to be entitled to
maintenance.
33. Masroor Ahmed v. State (NCT of Delhi)  4  , (Single Bench judgment,
authored by Badar Durrez Ahmed, J., as he then was) .
(i)The facts: Aisha Anjum was married to the petitioner – Masroor Ahmed,
on 02.04.2004.  The marriage was duly consummated and a daughter
was born to the couple (-on 22.10.2005).  It was alleged by the wife –
Aisha  Anjum,  that  the  husband’s  family  threw  her  out  of  her
matrimonial home   (-on 08.04.2005), on account of non-fulfilment of
dowry demands.  While the wife – Aisha Anjum was at her maternal
home,  the husband –  Masroor  Ahmed  filed a case for restitution of
4 2008 (103)  DRJ 137
68conjugal rights (-on 23.03.2006), before the Senior Civil Judge, Delhi.
During the course of the above proceedings, the wife returned to the
matrimonial home, to the company of her husband (-on 13.04.2006),
whereupon, marital cohabitation was restored.  Once again there was
discord  between  the  couple,  and  Masroor  Ahmed  pronounced
‘talaq-e-biddat’, on 28.08.2006.  The wife – Aisha Anjum alleged, that she
later came to know that her husband – Masroor Ahmed, had divorced
her by exercising his right of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, in the presence of  the
brothers of Aisha Anjum, in October 2006.  And that, the husband had
lied  to  the  Court,  (and  to  her,  as  well)  when  he  had  sought  her
restitution, from the Court, by making out as if the marriage was still
subsisting.  It was her claim, that she would not have agreed to conjugal
relations with him, had she known of the divorce.  And therefore, her
consent to have conjugal relations with Masroor Ahmed, was based on
fraud committed by him, on her – Aisha Anjum.  She therefore accused
Masroor Ahmed, for having committed the offence under Section 376 of
the  Indian  Penal  Code,  i.e.,  the  offence  of  rape.   She  also  claimed
maintenance  from  her  husband,  under  Section  125  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code.  During the pendency of the above proceedings, the
parties arrived at an amicable settlement on 1.9.2007.
(ii) The challenge: The position expressed by the High Court in paragraph
12  of  the  judgment,  crystalises  the  challenge.   Paragraph  12,  is
reproduced below:
69“12. Several questions impinging upon muslim law concepts arise for
consideration.  They are:-
(1) What is the legality and effect of a triple talaq?
(2) Does a talaq given in anger result in dissolution of marriage?
(3) What is the effect of non-communication of the talaq to the wife?
(4) Was the purported talaq of October 2005 valid?
(5) What is the effect of the second nikah of 19.4.2006?”
(iii)  The  consideration :  While  considering  the  legality  and  effect  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, the High Court recorded the following consideration:
“Sanctity and effect of Talaq-e-bidaat or triple talaq.
24. There is no difficulty with ahsan talaq or hasan talaq. Both 
have legal recognition under all fiqh schools, sunni or shia. The 
difficulty lies with triple talaq which is classed as bidaat (an 
innovation).  Generally  speaking,  the shia  schools  do  not 
recognise triple talaq as bringing about a valid divorce5. There is,
however, difference of opinion even within the sunni schools as 
to whether the triple talaq should be treated as three talaqs, 
irrevocably bringing to an end the marital relationship or as one 
rajai (revocable) talaq  6  , operating in much the same way as an 
ahsan talaq.”
 (iv) The conclusion : Based7 on8 the9 consideration recorded above, the High
Court arrived at the following conclusions:
“26. It is accepted by all schools of law that talaq-e-bidaat is sinful  10  . Yet
some schools regard it as valid. Courts in India have also held it to be
valid. The expression - bad in theology but valid in law - is often used in
this context. The fact remains that it is considered to be sinful. It was
5 With regard to triple talaq, Fyzee comments: Such a talaq is
lawful, although sinful, in Hanafi law; but in Ithna 'Ashari and the Fatimid laws it is not permissible. p.
154. Ameer Ali notes:  The Shiahs and the Malikis do not recognise the validity of the talak-ul-bid'at,
whilst the Hanafi and the Shaf'eis agree in holding that a divorce is effective, if pronounced in the bid'at
form, though in its commission the man incurs a sin . p. 435. These statements may not be accurate as to
the views of Malikis and Shaf'eis, but it is universally recognized that the above-mentioned Shi'a schools
do not find triple talaq to be a valid form of divorce.
6

70deprecated by prophet Muhammad  11  . It is definitely not recommended or
even approved by any school. It is not even considered to be a valid
divorce by shia schools. There are views even amongst the sunni schools
that the triple talaq pronounced in one go would not be regarded as three
talaqs but only as one. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that the
harsh abruptness of triple talaq has brought about extreme misery to the
divorced women and even to the men who are left with no chance to
undo the wrong or any scope to bring about a reconciliation . It is an
innovation which may have served a purpose at a particular point of time
in history12 but, if it is rooted out such a move would not be contrary to
any basic tenet of Islam or the Quran or any ruling of the Prophet
Muhammad.
27. In this background, I would hold that a triple talaq (talaq-e-bidaat),
even for sunni muslims be regarded as one revocable talaq. This would
enable the husband to have time to think and to have ample opportunity
to  revoke  the  same  during  the  iddat  period .  All  this  while,  family
members of the spouses could make sincere efforts at bringing about a
reconciliation.  Moreover, even if the iddat period expires and the talaq
can no longer be revoked as a consequence of it, the estranged couple
still has an opportunity to re-enter matrimony by contracting a fresh
nikah on fresh terms of mahr etc .”
A perusal of the conclusions recorded by the High Court would reveal, that
triple talaq pronounced at the same time, is to  be treated as a single
pronouncement  of  divorce.  And  therefore,  for  severing  matrimonial  ties
finally, the husband would have to complete the prescribed procedure, and
thereafter, the parties would be treated as divorced. 
34.13 141516 Nazeer  v. Shemeema  17  , (Single Bench judgment, authored by A.
Muhamed Mustaque, J.).
(i) The facts:  Through the above judgment, the High Court disposed of a
number of writ petitions, including three writ petitions, wherein husbands
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
71had  terminated  their  matrimonial  alliance  with  their  spouses,  by
pronouncing ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.  Their matrimonial relationship
having come to an end, one or the other or both (-this position is unclear,
from the judgment) spouses approached the passport authorities, to delete
the name of their former spouse, from their respective passports.  The
passport authorities declined to accept their request, as the same was
based on private actions of the parties, which were only supported by
unauthenticated ‘talaq-namas’ (deeds of divorce).  The stance adopted by
the passport authorities was, that in the absence of a formal decree of
divorce, the name of the spouse could not be deleted.  By passing interim
directions, the High Court ordered the passport authorities, to correct the
spouse  details  (as  were  sought),  based  on  the  admission  of  the
corresponding spouse, that their matrimonial alliance had been dissolved.
(ii)  The challenge :  Even though the authenticity and/or the legality of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, did not arise for consideration before the High Court, it
noticed “….Though the issue related to triple talaq does not directly crop up
in these writ petitions calling upon this Court to decide the validity of triple
talaq, this Court cannot ignore while granting a relief based on admission,
the fact that direction of this Court would result in greater or lesser extent
of injustice if it remains oblivious to the repercussions of the repudiation of
marriage by volition of individual…..”.  The High Court therefore, embarked
on the exercise of examining the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.
(iii)  The consideration :  The High Court took into consideration texts by
renowned  scholars,  as  for  instance,  from  “Sharia”  by  Wael  B.  Hallaq,
72“Sharia Law, An Introduction” by Mohammad Hashim Kamali, “Qur’an: The
Living Truth” by Basheer  Ahmad  Mohyidin,  “Muslim  Law in  India And
Abroad” by Dr. Tahir Mahmood, “The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam” by
Sheikh  Yusuf  al-Qaradawi,  from  the  Urdu  book  “Hikmatul  Islam”  by
Moulana  Wahidul  Khan.   The  High  Court  also  took  into  consideration
Quranic verses (all of which have been, extracted above).  The High Court
even took note of the two judgments of the Gauhati High Court (referred to
above), besides other High Court judgments, and thereupon, observed as
under:
“12.  This  case  only  symptomize  the  harsh  realities  encountered  by
women belonging to Muslim community, especially of the lower strata. It
is a reminder to the court unless the plight of sufferers is alleviated in a
larger scheme through legislation by the State, justice will be a distant
dream deflecting the promise of justice by the State ""equality before the
law"". The State is constitutionally bound and committed to respect the
promise  of  dignity  and  equality  before  law  and  it  cannot  shirk  its
responsibility by remaining mute spectator of the malady suffered by
Muslim women in the name of religion and their inexorable quest for
justice  broke  all  the  covenants  of  the  divine  law  they  professed  to
denigrate  the  believer  and  faithful.  Therefore,  the  remainder  of  the
judgment is a posit to the State and contribution for settlement of the
'legal vex' which remains unconcluded more than four decades after this
court's reminder in Mohamed Haneefas' case (supra).
13. The State is constitutionally obliged to maintain coherent order in the
society, foundation of which is laid by the family. Thus sustenance or
purity of the marriage will lay a strong foundation for the society, without
which there would be neither civilisation nor progress. My endeavour in
this judgment would have been over with the laying of correct principles
related to triple talaq in Qur'anic perspective to declare the law and to
decide the matter.  However, I find the dilemma in this context is not a
singular problem arisen demanding a resolution of the dispute between
the  litigants  by  way  of  adjudication.  But  rather  it  require  a  State
intervention  by  way  of  legislation  to  regulate  triple  talaq  in  India.
Therefore, settlement of law relating to talaq is necessary and further
discussion is to be treated as an allude for the State to consider for
possible reforms of divorce Law of Muslim in this Country . The empirical
research placed herein justifies such course of action to remind the State
for action. It is to be noted, had the Muslim in India been governed by
the  true  Islamic  law,  Penal  law  would  have  acted  as  deliverance  to
73sufferings of Muslim women in India to deter arbitrary talaq in violation
of Qur'anic injunction.
xxx xxx xxx
15. This takes me to the question why the State is so hesitant to reforms.
It appears from public debate that resistance is from a small section of
Ulemas  (scholars  within  the  society)  on  the  ground  that  Sharia  is
immutable and any interference would amount to negation of freedom of
religion guaranteed under the Constitution . I find this dilemma of Ulema
is on a conjecture of repugnancy of divine law and secular law. The State
also appears as reluctant on an assumption that reforms of religious
practice  would  offend  religious  freedom  guaranteed  under  the
Constitution of India . This leads me to discuss on facets of Islamic law. I
also find it equally important to discuss about the reforms of personal
law  relating  to  triple  talaq  within  the  constitutional  polity,  as  the
ultimately value of its legality has to be tested under the freedom of
religious practices.”
(iv) The conclusion :  In the background of the above consideration, the High
Court held as under:
“The W.P.(C) 37436 of 2003 is filed by the husband alleging that the
triple talaq pronounced by him is not valid in accordance with Islamic
law. Therefore, proceedings initiated before the Magistrate under Section
3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 and
consequent order will have to be set aside. This case depicts the misuse
of triple talaq, wife appears to have accepted the talaq and moved the
Magistrate court on a folly created by husband . There are innumerable
cases as revealed from the empirical data referred in the research in
which neither party are aware of the procedure of talaq according to the
personal law. This Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is
not expected to go into the disputed questions of fact. The entire exercise
in this judgment is to alert the State that justice has become elusive to
the Muslim woman and the remedy thereof lies in codification of law of
divorce. This court cannot grant any relief to the writ petitioner as the
true application of the law to be considered in a given facts is upon the
Court trying the matter. It is for the subordinate court to decide whether
there was application of Islamic law in effecting divorce by triple talaq.
Therefore, declining jurisdiction, this writ petition is dismissed.
W.P.(C) Nos. 25318 & 26373 of 2015 and 11438 of 2016
In these Writ Petitions question of validity of triple talaq does not arise.
However  this  question  was  considered  in  larger  perspective  for  the
reason that if court grant any relief based on admission of the parties as
to the repudiation of marriage by triple talaaq, that would amount to
recognition of a triple talaq effected not in accordance with law, as this
court  has  no  mechanism  to  find  out  the  manner  in  which  talaq  is
effected. The Court cannot become a party to a proceedings to recognise
74an ineffective divorce in the guise of directions being given to passport
authorities to accept the divorce. The legal effect of such divorce has to
be probed by a fact finding authority in accordance with the true Islamic
law. Stamp of approval being given by the court by ordering passport
authority to accept divorce effected not in accordance with the law, will
create an impression that court transgressed its limits while directing a
public authority to honour an act which was done not in accordance
with law. Though in these Writ Petitions, considering the urgency of the
matters,  this  court  granted  interim  order  directing  the  passport
authorities to act upon the request of the petitioners.  Considering the
large number of similar reliefs sought before this court in various Writ
Petitions, this court is of the view that the issue can be resolved only
through  a  larger  remedy  of  codification  of  law  in  the  light  of  the
discussion as above. In the light of interim order, these Writ Petitions are
disposed of.
Conclusion:
Courts interpret law and evolve justice on such interpretation of law. It is
in the domain of the legislature to make law. Justice has become elusive
for Muslim women in India not because of the religion they profess, but
on account of lack of legal formalism resulting in immunity from law .
Law required to be aligned with justice. The search for solution to this
predicament lies in the hands of the law makers. It is for the law makers
to correlate law and social phenomena relating to divorce through the
process of legislation to advance justice in institutionalized form . It is
imperative that to advance justice, law must be formulated without any
repugnance to the religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution
of India. It is for the State to consider the formulation of codified law to
govern the matter.  Therefore, I conclude by drawing attention of those
who resist any form of reform of the divorce law of Muslim community in
India to the following verses of Holy Quran . (Chapter 47:2)
""And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is
revealed  unto  Muhammad  -  and  it  is  the  truth  from  their  Lord-He
riddeth them of their ill deeds and improveth their state .""
""Thus we display the revelations for people who have sense "" (Chapter
30:28)
The  Registry shall  forward  the  copy of this judgment to  Union  Law
Ministry and Law Commission of India.”
A perusal of the conclusions drawn by the High Court reveals, that the
practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  was  deprecated  by  the  Court.   The  Court
however called upon the legislature, to codify the law on the issue, as would
result in the advancement of justice, as a matter of institutional form.
75Part-7.
The petitioner’s and the interveners’ contentions :
35.On  behalf  of  the  petitioner,  besides  the  petitioner  herself,
submissions were initiated by Mr. Amit Singh Chadha, Senior Advocate.  He
invited this Court’s attention to the legislative history in the field of Muslim
‘personal law’ (-for details, refer to Part-4 – Legislation in India, in the field
of Muslim ‘personal law’).  It was submitted, that all fundamental rights
contained in Part III of the Constitution were justiciable.  It was therefore
pointed out, that the petitioner’s cause before this Court, was akin to such
rights  as  were  considered  justiciable.   The  practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
according to learned counsel, permitted a male spouse an unqualified right,
to severe the matrimonial tie.  It was pointed out, that the right to divorce a
wife, by way of triple talaq, could be exercised without the disclosure of any
reason, and in fact, even in the absence of reasons.  It was submitted, that
a female spouse had no say in the matter, inasmuch as, ‘talaq-e-biddat’
could be pronounced in the absence of the wife, and even without her
knowledge.  It was submitted, that divorce pronounced by way of triple
talaq was final and binding, between the parties.  These actions, according
to learned counsel, vested an arbitrary right in the husband, and as such,
violated the equality clause enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution.  It
was submitted, that the Constitution postulates through the above article,
equality  before  the  law  and  equal  protection  of  the  laws.   This  right,
according to learned counsel, was clearly denied to the female spouse in the
matter  of  pronouncement  of  divorce  by  the  husband  by  adopting  the
76procedure  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  Further  more,  it  was  submitted,  the
Constitution  postulates  through  Article  15,  a  clear  restraint  on
discrimination, on the ground of sex.  It was submitted, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’
violated the aforesaid fundamental right, which postulates equality between
men and women.  Learned counsel relied on the decisions of this Court in
Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala18, and Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of
India19 to contend, that it was the duty of courts to intervene in case of
violation of any individual’s fundamental right, and to render justice.  It was
also submitted, that the rights of the female partner in a matrimonial
alliance amongst Muslims, had resulted in severe gender discrimination,
which amounted to violating their human rights under Article 21 of the
Constitution.  Learned counsel accordingly sought intervention, for grave
injustice practiced against Muslim wives.
36.Mr.  Amit  Singh  Chadha,  learned  senior  counsel,  then  placed
reliance  on  the  Jiauddin  Ahmed2,  and  the  Rukia  Khatun3 cases  (-for
details,  refer  to  Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’).  Based on the above judgments, it was submitted, that
courts of this country had not found favour with the practice of triple
talaq,  in  the  manner  prevalent  in  India.   It  was  contended,  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’ should not be confused with the profession, practice and
propagation of Islam.  It was pointed out, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was not
sacrosanctal to the profession of the Muslim religion.  It was accordingly
submitted, that this Court had an indefeasible right, to intervene and
18
19
77render  justice.   In  order  to  press  his  claim  based  on  constitutional
morality, wherein the petitioners were claiming not only gender equality,
but also the progression of their matrimonial life with dignity, learned
senior  counsel  placed  reliance  on  Manoj  Narula  v.  Union  of  India20,
wherein this Court observed as under:
“The Constitution of India is a living instrument with capabilities of
enormous dynamism. It is a Constitution made for a progressive society.
Working of such a Constitution depends upon the prevalent atmosphere
and conditions. Dr Ambedkar had, throughout the debate, felt that the
Constitution can live and grow on the bedrock of constitutional morality.
Speaking on the same, he said :
“Constitutional  morality  is  not  a  natural  sentiment.  It  has  to  be
cultivated.  We  must  realise  that  our  people  have  yet  to  learn  it.
Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil, which is
essentially undemocratic.” 
[Constituent Assembly Debates , 1948, Vol. VII, 38.]
The principle of constitutional morality basically means to bow down to
the norms of the Constitution and not to act in a manner which would
become violative of the rule of law or reflectible of action in an arbitrary
manner. It actually works at the fulcrum and guides as a laser beam in
institution  building.  The  traditions and conventions have  to  grow to
sustain the value of such a morality . The democratic values survive and
become successful where the people at large and the persons in charge of
the  institution  are  strictly  guided  by  the  constitutional  parameters
without paving the path of deviancy and reflecting in action the primary
concern  to  maintain  institutional  integrity  and  the  requisite
constitutional restraints.  Commitment to the Constitution is a face  t of
constitutional morality …”
In continuation with the instant submission, it was also the contention of
learned senior counsel, that Articles 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution, did
not in any manner, impair the jurisdiction of this Court, to set right the
apparent breach of constitutional  morality.   In this behalf, the Court’s
attention was invited to the fact, that Article 25 itself postulates, that the
freedoms contemplated thereunder, were subject to the overriding principles
20
78enshrined  in  Part  III  –  Fundamental  Rights,  of  the  Constitution.  This
position, it was submitted, was affirmed through judgments rendered by
this  Court  in  John  Vallamattom  v.  Union  of  India21, Javed  v.  State  of
Haryana22, and Khursheed Ahmad Khan v. State of Uttar Pradesh23. 
37.Learned senior counsel also drew our attention to the fact, that a
number of countries had, by way of express legislations, done away with the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was submitted, that even when talaq was
pronounced  thrice  simultaneously,  the  same  has,  by  legislation,  been
treated as a single pronouncement, in a number of countries, including
countries which have declared Islam as their official State religion.  It was
accordingly contended, that had ‘talaq-e-biddat’ been an essential part of
religion, i.e., if it constituted a core belief, on which Muslim religion was
founded,  it  could  not  have  been  interfered  with,  by  such  legislative
intervention.  It was accordingly suggested, that this Court should have no
difficulty whatsoever in remedying the cause with which the petitioners had
approached  this  Court,  as  the  same  was  not  only  violative  of  the
fundamental  rights  enshrined  in  the  Constitution,  but  was  also  in
contravention of the principle of constitutional morality emerging therefrom.
38.Last of all, it was contended, that it is nobody’s case before this
Court, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is a part of an edict flowing out of the Quran.  It
was submitted, that triple talaq is not recognized by many schools of Islam.
21
22
23
79According  to  learned  counsel,  all  concerned  acknowledge,  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’ has all along been treated irregular, patriarchal and even
sinful.  It was pointed out, that it is accepted by all schools – even of Sunni
Muslims, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is “bad in theology but good in law”.  In
addition, it was pointed out, that even the Union of India had affirmed
before this Court, the position expressed above.  In such situation, it was
prayed, that this Court being a constitutional court, was obliged to perform
its constitutional responsibility under Article 32 of the Constitution,  as a
protector, enforcer, and guardian of citizens’ rights under Articles 14, 15
and 21 of the Constitution. It was submitted, that in discharge of the above
constitutional obligation, this Court ought to strike down, the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, as violative of the fundamental rights and constitutional
morality  contemplated  by  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution.   It  was
commended, that the instant practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ should be done
away with, in the same manner as the practice of ‘Sati’, ‘Devadasi’ and
‘Polygamy’, which were components of Hindu religion, and faith.  Learned
counsel concluded his submissions by quoting from the Constitutional Law
of India, by H.M. Seervai (fourth edition, Volume 2, published by N.M.
Tripathi Private Ltd., Bombay), wherein in clause 12.60, at page 1281, the
author has expressed the following view:
“12.60 I am aware that the enforcement of laws which are violated is the
duty of Govt., and in a number of recent cases that duty has not been
discharged.  Again, in the last instance, blatant violation of religious
freedom by the arbitrary action of religious heads has to be dealt with
firmly by our highest Court.  This duty has resolutely discharged by our
High Courts and the Privy Council before our Constitution.  No greater
service can be done to our country than by the Sup. Ct. and the High
Courts discharging that duty resolutely, disregarding popular clamour
80and  disregarding  personal  predilections .   I  am  not  unaware  of  the
present political and judicial climate.  But I would like to conclude with
the words of very great man “never despair”, for when evil reaches a
particular point, the antidote of that evil is near at hand.”
39.Mr. Anand Grover, Senior Advocate, represented Zakia Soman –
respondent no.10.  Respondent no.10 was added as a party respondent on
29.6.2016, on the strength of an interlocutory application filed by her.
Learned senior advocate, in the first instance, invited our attention to the
various kinds of ‘talaq’ practiced amongst Muslims (-for details, refer to
Part-2  –  The  practiced  modes  of  ‘talaq’  amongst  Muslims).   It  was
submitted, that ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ were approved by the
Quran and the ‘hadith’.  It was submitted, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is neither
recognized by the Quran, nor approved by the ‘hadith’.   With reference to
‘talaq-e-biddat’, it was asserted, that the same was contrary to Quranic
prescriptions.  It was submitted, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was
traceable to the second century, after the advent of Islam.  It was asserted,
that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is recognized only by a few Sunni schools, including the
Hanafi school.  In this behalf, it was also brought to our notice, that most of
the Muslims in India belonged to the Hanafi school of Sunni Muslims.  It
was  submitted,  that  even  the  Hanafi  school  acknowledges,  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’ is a sinful form of divorce, but seeks to justify it on the
ground  that  though  bad  in  theology,  it  is  good  in  law.   In  India
‘talaq-e-biddat’, according to learned counsel, gained validity based on the
acceptance of the same by the British courts, prior to independence.  It was
submitted, that the judgments rendered by the British courts were finally
crystallized, in the authoritative pronouncement by the Privy Council in the
81Rashid Ahmad case1.  It was pointed out, that thereafter, ‘talaq-e-biddat’
has been consistently practised in India.
40.The  first  contention  advanced  at  the  hands  of  learned  senior
counsel  was,  that  after  the  adoption  of  the  Constitution,  various  High
Courts in India had the occasion to consider the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
exercised by Muslim men to divorce their wives.  And all the High Courts
(which had the occasion to deal with the issue) unanimously arrived at the
conclusion, that the same could not muster support either from the Quran
or the ‘hadith’.  In this behalf, the Court’s attention was drawn to the
various judgments of High Courts including the High Court of Gauhati in
the  Jiauddin Ahmed case2 – by a Single Bench, and by the same High
Court in the Rukia Khatun case3 – by a Division Bench.  By the Delhi High
Court in the Masroor Ahmed case4 – by a Single Bench, and finally by the
Kerala High Court in the Nazeer case5 – by a Single Bench (-for details,
refer  to  Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’).    It  was  submitted,  that  the  High  Courts  were  fully
justified in their opinions and their conclusions.  It was pointed out, that
despite the aforesaid judgments, Muslim husbands continued to divorce
their  wives  by  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  and  therefore,  an  authoritative
pronouncement on the matter was required to be delivered, by this Court.
Based on the decisions relied upon, it was submitted, that a Muslim
husband,  could  not  enjoy arbitrary  or  unilateral  power  to  proclaim  a
divorce, as the same does not accord with Islamic traditions. It was also
contended, that the proclamation of talaq must be for a demonstrated
82reasonable cause, and must proceed by an attempt at reconciliation by
two arbiters (one each, from the side of the rival parties).  In order to
affirm the aforesaid position, learned counsel placed reliance on Shamim
Ara v. State of U.P.24, to assert, that this Court approved the judgments
referred to above. It was accordingly asserted, that this Court has already
recognized, the Quranic position as recorded in verses 128 to 130 of ‘sura’
IV and verses 229-232 of ‘sura’ II, and also, ‘verse’ 35 of ‘sura’ IV.  These
verses,  according  to  learned  senior  counsel,  declare  the  true  Quranic
position on the subject of divorce (-for details, refer to Part-3 – The Holy
Quran – with reference to ‘talaq’).  Learned counsel heavily relied on the
decision rendered by the Delhi High Court in the Masroor Ahmed case4,
and  by the  Kerala High Court in  the Nazeer  case5  to  bring home  his
contention, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was wholly unjustified and could not be
recognized as a valid means of divorce in the Muslim community.  It was
the vehement submission of learned counsel, that the legal position being
canvassed  on  behalf  of  the  petitioners,  clearly  emerged  from  the
judgments referred to above, and should be treated as the foundation, for
adoption and declaration by this Court.  It was therefore prayed, that
triple talaq as was being practiced in India, be declared unsustainable in
law.
41.It was also contended by learned senior counsel, that the settled
principles applicable in all common law jurisdictions including India was
that courts do not test the constitutionality of laws and procedures, if the
issue arising between the parties can be decided on other grounds.  It was
24
83submitted,  that  only  when  the  relief  being  sought,  cannot  be  granted
without going into the constitutionality of the law, only then courts need to
enter the thicket of its constitutional validity.  Learned counsel invited the
Court’s attention, to the judgment of this Court in State of Bihar v. Rai
Bahadur  Hurdut Roy Moti Lal Jute Mills25, wherein this Court refused to
test the constitutional validity of certain provisions, by holding as under:
“7. On behalf of the appellant Mr Lal Narain Sinha has contended that
the High Court was in error in holding that the proviso to Section 14A
violates either Article 20(1) or Article 31(2) of the Constitution. He has
addressed us at length in support of his case that neither of the two
articles  is violated  by the impuged proviso. On the other  hand, the
learned Solicitor-General has sought to support the findings of the High
Court on the said two constitutional points; and he has pressed before
us as a preliminary point his argument that on a fair and reasonable
construction,  the  proviso  cannot  be  applied  to  the  case  of  the  first
respondent. We would, therefore, first deal with this preliminary point. In
cases  where  the  vires  of  statutory  provisions  are  challenged  on
constitutional grounds, it is essential that the material facts should first
be  clarified  and  ascertained  with  a  view  to  determine  whether  the
impugned  statutory  provisions  are  attracted;  if  they  are,  the
constitutional challenge to their validity must be examined and decided.
If, however, the facts admitted or proved do not attract the impugned
provisions there is no occasion to decide the issue about the vires of the
said provisions. Any decision on the said question would in such a case
be  purely  academic.  Courts  are  and  should  be  reluctant  to  decide
constitutional points merely as matters of academic importance .
xxx xxx xxx
19. In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider the objections
raised by the first respondent against the validity of the proviso on the
ground that it contravenes Articles 20(1) and 31(2) of the Constitution..
…”
In the context of ‘personal law’, it was submitted, that in Shabnam Hashmi
v.  Union  of  India26,  the  Court  had  recently  refused  to  examine  the
constitutional validity of ‘personal laws’, when the issue could be plainly
decided on the interpretation of the concerned statute.  It was therefore
25
26
84contended, that through a purely interpretative exercise, this Court should
declare ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as illegal, ineffective and having no force in law, in
the same manner as the Gauhati High Court and the Delhi High Court,
have previously so held.  It was submitted, that the same declaration be
given  by  this  Court,  by  an  interpretation  of  ‘personal  law’,  as  would
incorporate the ingredients of the permissible and acceptable modes of talaq
into ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  
42.In the present determination, learned senior counsel submitted,
that it would be essential to recognize the existence of distortions in the
‘hadiths’.  It was pointed out, that it was by now well settled, that there
were various degrees of reliability and/or authenticity of different ‘hadiths’
(reference in this behalf was made to – Principles of Mohomedan Law by Sir
Dinshaw Fardunji Mulla, LexisNexis, Butterworths Wadhwa, Nagpur, 20th
edition).  It was the contention of learned senior counsel, that the All India
Muslim Personal Law Board (hereinafter referred to as, the AIMPLB), had
relied on ‘hadiths’, that were far removed from the time of the Prophet.  It
was submitted, that they were therefore far less credible and authentic, and
also  distorted  and  unreliable,  as  against  the  ‘hadiths’  taken  into
consideration in the judgments rendered by the High Courts (-for details,
refer  to  Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’).  It was pointed out, that the AIMPLB had relied upon a
later ‘hadith’ (that is, Sunan Bayhaqi 7/547).  It was pointed out, that when
compared to the ‘hadith’ of Bhukahri (published by Darussalam, Saudi
Arabia), the ‘hadith’ relied upon by the AIMPLB appeared to be a clear
85distortion.  It  was  also  submitted,  that  the  ‘hadith’  relied  upon  by  the
AIMPLB, was not found in the Al Bukhari Hadiths, and as such, it would be
inappropriate to place reliance on the same.  As against the submissions
advanced on behalf of AIMPLB, it was pointed out (in rejoinder), that Sahih
Muslims believe, that during the Prophet’s time, and that of the First Caliph
Abu Baqhr and the Second Caliph Umar, pronouncements of ‘talaq’ by three
consecutive utterances were treated as one.  Reference in this behalf was
made  to  “Sahih  Muslim”  compiled  by  Al-Hafiz  Zakiuddin  Abdul-Azim
Al-Mundhiri, and published by Darussalam.  Learned senior counsel also
invited this Court’s attention to “The lawful and the prohibited in Islam” by
Al-Halal  Wal  Haram  Fil  Islam  (edition  –  August  2009),  which  was  of
Egyptian origin.  It was pointed out, that Egypt was primarily a Sunni
Hanafi nation.  It was submitted, that the text of the above publication,
clearly showed, that the practice of instant talaq was described sinful, and
was  to  be  abhorred.   Reference  was  also  made  to  “Woman  in  Islamic
Shariah” by Maulana Wahiduddin Khan (published by Goodword Books,
reprinted in 2014), wherein it is opined, that triple talaq pronounced on a
singular occasion, would be treated as a single pronouncement of talaq, in
terms of the ‘hadith’ of Imam Abu Dawud in Fath al-bari 9/27.  It was
submitted, that the views of the above author, were also relied upon by the
Delhi High Court in the Masroor Ahmed case4.  Reference was also made to
“Marriage  and  family  life  in  Islam”  by  Prof.  (Dr.)  A.  Rahman  (Adam
Publishers and Distributors, New Delhi, 2013 edition), wherein by placing
reliance on a Hanafi Muslim scholar, it was expressed that triple talaq was
86not in consonance with Quranic verses.  Reliance was also placed on “Imam
Abu Hanifa – Life and Work” by Allamah Shiblinu’mani’s of Azamgarh, who
founded the Shibli College in the 19th century.  It was submitted, that Abu
Hanifa himself ruled, that it was forbidden to give three divorces at the
same time, and whoever did so was a sinner.  Based on the aforestated
submissions, it was the pointed contention of learned senior counsel, that
there was no credibility in the position adopted by the AIMPLB, in its
pleadings to demonstrate the validity of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.
43.Based  on  the  above  submissions,  it  was  contended,  that  the
judgment rendered by the Privy Council in the Rashid Ahmad case1 with
reference to the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ needed to be overruled.  Since
‘talaq-e-biddat’  cannot  be  traced  to  the  Quran,  and  since  the  Prophet
himself deprecated it, and since ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was considered sinful by all
schools of Sunni Muslims, and as invalid by all the Shia Muslim schools, it
could not be treated to be a part of Muslim ‘personal law’. It was asserted,
that triple talaq was not in tune with the prevailing social conditions, as
Muslim women were vociferously protesting against the practice.  Learned
senior counsel solicited, that this Court in order to resolve the present
dispute,  declare  that  the  pronouncement  of  triple  talaq  by  a  Muslim
husband,  in  order  to  divorce  his  wife,  would  be  treated  as  a  single
pronouncement  of  talaq,  and  would  have  to  follow  the  procedure  of
‘talaq-e-ahsan’ (or, ‘talaq-e-hasan’) in accordance with the Quran, so as to
conclude a binding dissolution of marriage by way of ‘talaq’, in terms of
Muslim ‘personal law’.
8744.Ms.  Indira  Jaising,  Senior  Advocate,  was  the  third  counsel  to
represent the cause of the petitioners.  She entered appearance on behalf of
respondent no.7 –  Centre for Study of Society and Secularism, which came
to be added as a party respondent vide an order dated 29.6.2016. It was the
contention of learned senior counsel, that the term ‘personal laws’ had not
been defined in the Constitution, although there was reference to the same
in entry 5 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule. Learned counsel
referred to Article 372 of the Constitution which mandates, that all laws in
force, in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the
Constitution, “shall” continue in force until altered or repealed or amended
by a competent legislature (or other competent authority). It was submitted,
that on personal issues, Muslims were governed by the Muslim ‘personal
law’ – Shariat. It was contended, that even before, the commencement of the
Constitution,  the  Muslim  Personal  Law  (Shariat)  Application  Act,  1937
enforced Muslim ‘personal law’, and as such, the Muslim ‘personal law’
should be considered as a “law in force”, within the meaning of Article 13(3)
(b).  It was pointed out, that the instant position made the legal position
separate and distinct from what ordinarily falls in the realm of ‘personal
law’.  It was also highlighted, that a reading of entry 5 in the Concurrent
List of the Seventh Schedule, leaves no room for any doubt, that ‘personal
law’ necessarily has to have nexus, to issues such as marriage and divorce,
infants and minors, adoptions, wills, intestacy and succession, joint family
property and partition, etc.  It was contented, that ‘personal law’ could
therefore conveniently be described as family law, namely, disputes relating
88to issues concerning the family. It was pointed out, that such family law
disputes, were ordinarily adjudicated upon by the Family Courts, set up
under  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1984.  The  matters  which  arise  for
consideration before the Family Courts are disputes of marriage (namely,
restitution  of  conjugal  rights,  or  judicial  separation,  or  dissolution  of
marriage), and the like.  Based on the above backdrop, it was submitted,
that it could be safely accepted that ‘personal law’ deals with family laws
and law of succession such as marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance,
etc.
45.Based on the foundation recorded in the preceding paragraph, it
was submitted, that the question in the present controversy was, whether
“rule of decision” (the term used in Section 2, of the Shariat Act) could be
challenged, on the ground that the same was violative of the fundamental
rights  postulated  in  Part  III  of  the  Constitution?  It  was  the  pointed
contention of learned counsel, that no “rule of decision” can be violative of
Part III of the Constitution.  It was acknowledged (we would say – fairly),
that ‘personal law’ which pertained to disputes between the family and
private individuals (wherein the State has no role), cannot be subject to a
challenge,  on  the  ground  of  being  violative  of  the  fundamental  rights
enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.  It was submitted, that insofar as
Muslim  ‘personal  law’  is  concerned,  it  could  no  longer  be  treated  as
‘personal law’, because it had been statutorily declared as “rule of decision”
by Section 2 of the Shariat Act.  It was therefore asserted, that all questions
pertaining to Muslims, ‘personal law’ having been described as “rule of
89decision” could no longer be treated as private matters between parties, nor
can they be treated as matters of mere ‘personal law’.  It was therefore
contended, that consequent upon the inclusion/subject of the question of
“…dissolution  of  marriage,  including  talaq,  ila,  zihar,  lian,  khula  and
mubaraat,…”, amongst Muslims in the statute book, the same did not
remain  a  private  matter  between  the  parties.   And  as  such,  all
questions/matters, falling within the scope of Section 2 aforementioned,
were liable to be considered as matters of ‘public law’.  Learned senior
counsel therefore asserted, that no one could contest the legitimacy of a
challenge to ‘public law’ on the ground of being violative of the provisions of
the Constitution.  In support of the aforesaid foundational premise, learned
senior counsel placed reliance on Charu Khurana v. Union of India27, to
contend  that  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  should  be  considered  as  arbitrary  and
discriminatory, under Articles 14 and 15, in the same manner as the rule
prohibiting  women  make-up  artists  and  hair  dressers  from  becoming
members of registered make-up artists and hair dressers association, was
so declared.  It was also pointed out, that discrimination based on sex was
opposed to gender justice, which position was clearly applicable to the
controversy  in  hand.   Insofar  as  the  instant  aspect  of  the  matter  is
concerned, learned counsel placed reliance on the following observations
recorded in the above judgment:
“46. These bye-laws have been certified by the Registrar of Trade Unions
in exercise of the statutory power. Clause 4, as is demonstrable, violates
Section 21 of the Act, for the Act has not made any distinction between
27
90men and women. Had it made a bald distinction it would have been
indubitably unconstitutional. The legislature, by way of amendment in
Section 21-A, has only fixed the age.  It is clear to us that the clause,
apart  from  violating  the  statutory  command,  also  violates  the
constitutional  mandate  which  postulates  that  there  cannot  be  any
discrimination on the ground of sex. Such discrimination in the access of
employment  and  to  be  considered  for  the  employment  unless  some
justifiable riders are attached to it, cannot withstand scrutiny. When the
access  or  entry  is  denied,  Article  21  which  deals  with  livelihood  is
offended. It also works against the fundamental human rights. Such
kind  of  debarment  creates  a  concavity  in  her  capacity  to  earn  her
livelihood.

50. From the aforesaid enunciation of law, the signification of right to
livelihood gets clearly spelt out.  A clause in the bye-laws of a trade
union,  which  calls  itself  an  Association,  which  is  accepted  by  the
statutory authority, cannot play foul of Article 21 .”
46.Learned senior counsel, thereupon attempted to express the same
position, through a different reasoning.  It is necessary to recall, that the
question posed for consideration is, whether this Court should accept “rule
of decision” under Section 2 of the Shariat Act – as “laws in force” within the
meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution, and thereby, test the validity
thereof, on the touchstone of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of
the Constitution?  It was the fervent contention of learned senior counsel,
that all questions falling for consideration within the meaning of the term
“rule of decision” had necessarily to be treated as “laws in force”.  Thus, it
was submitted, that such laws were to be in consonance with the provisions
of  Part  III  –  Fundamental  Rights,  of  the  Constitution.   Insofar  as  the
challenge  to  the  constitutional  validity  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  is  concerned,
learned senior counsel, adopted the submissions advanced by other learned
counsel.
9147.Learned  senior  counsel,  then  placed  reliance  on  the  Universal
Declaration  of  Human  Rights  adopted  by  the  United  Nations  General
Assembly on 10.12.1948, to contend that the preamble thereof recognised
the inherent dignity of the entire human family, as equal and inalienable.
It was submitted, that the charter provides for equal rights to men and
women.  It was submitted, that Article 1 thereof provides, that all human
beings were born free and equal, in dignity and rights.  Referring to Article
2, it was submitted, that there could be no distinction/discrimination on
the basis inter alia of sex and/or religion.  It was submitted, that it was this
Court’s responsibility to widen, and not to narrow, the right of equality
contained in the aforestated Declaration.  The Court’s attention was also
drawn to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights  (ICESCR),  which  provided  for  elimination  of  all  forms  of
discrimination against women.  The instant convention was adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly on 10.04.1979.  It was submitted, that
the International Convention bill of rights for women, was instituted on
3.9.1981, and had been ratified by 189 States.  It was pointed out, that
India had also endorsed the same.  It was submitted, that Article 1 thereof
defines “discrimination”, as discrimination against women on the basis of
sex.  Referring to Article 2, it was submitted, that all State parties who
ratified the above convention, condemned discrimination against women in
all its forms, and agreed to eliminate discrimination against women by
following  the  principle  of  equality  amongst  men  and  women,  in  their
national Constitutions, as well as, other legislations.  It was submitted, that
92Article 2 of the convention mandates, that all States would take all steps to
eliminate discrimination against women – by any person, organisation or
enterprise.  It was submitted, that insofar as the present controversy is
concerned, the provisions of the above declarations and conventions can be
relied upon, to test the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, by treating it as “rule of
decision” and for that matter, as law in force (on the touchstone of Articles
14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution).  It was further submitted, that in any
case, the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, clearly violated the norms adopted by
the declaration, and conventions.
48.It  was  acknowledged,  by  learned  senior  counsel,  that  India
recognises a plural legal system, wherein different religious communities
are permitted to be governed by different ‘personal laws’, applicable to them.
It was submitted, that there could be no dispute, that different religious
communities  can  have  different  laws,  but  the  laws  of  each  religious
community  must  meet  the  test  of  constitutional  validity  and/or
constitutional morality, inasmuch as, they cannot be violative of Articles 14
and 15 of the Constitution.  Viewed in the above context, it was submitted,
that even though matters of faith and belief are protected by Article 25 of
the Constitution, yet law relating  to marriage and divorce were matters of
faith and belief, were also liable to be tested on grounds of public order,
morality and health, as well as, on the touchstone of the other provisions of
Part III of the Constitution.  Therefore, on a plain reading of Article 25,
according to learned senior counsel, the right to freedom of conscience was
subject to public order, morality, health, and the other provisions contained
93in Part III of the Constitution.  And as such, according to learned counsel,
the said rights must be so interpreted, that no ‘personal law’ negates any of
the postulated conditions contained in Article 25 of the Constitution itself.
It was submitted, that Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution were not
subject to any restrictions, including any restriction under Article 25 or 26
of  the  Constitution.   It  was  contended,  that  the  cardinal  principle  of
interpretation  of  the  Constitution  was,  that  all  provisions  of  the
Constitution must be harmoniously construed, so that there remained no
conflict between them.  It was therefore submitted, that Articles 14 and 15
on  the  one  hand,  and  Articles  25  and  26  on  the  other,  must  be
harmoniously construed with each other, to prevent discrimination against
women, in a manner as would give effect to equality, irrespective of gender.
It was contended, that it was totally irrelevant whether ‘personal law’ was
founded on custom or religion, or was codified or uncodified, if it is law and
“rule of decision”, it can be challenged under Part III of the Constitution.  
49.Learned  senior  counsel,  also  expressed  a  personal  view  on  the
matter, namely, that divorce altered the status of  married women, which
can leave her destitute.  It was asserted, that for all other communities in
India,  divorce  could  only  be  obtained  from  a  judicial  forum.   And,  a
judgment and decree of divorce, was a decision in rem, which alters the legal
status  of  the  concerned  person,  as  against  the  whole  world.   It  was
submitted, that for all other communities in India, divorce was not a matter
between the private parties, to be settled on their own.  Nor could any
‘fatwa’ be issued, recognising unilateral ‘talaq’.  It was submitted, that for
94one party alone, the right to annul a marriage, by a unilateral private ‘talaq’,
was  clearly  against  public  policy,  and  required  to  be  declared  as
impermissible in law, and even unconstitutional.  In this behalf, it was
contended, that no person’s status could be adversely altered so as to suffer
civil consequences (for the concerned person – the wife in this case) by a
private declaration.  It was submitted, that annulment of the matrimonial
bond was essentially a judicial function, which must be exercised by a
judicial forum.  Any divorce granted by way of a private action, could not be
considered as legally sustainable in law.  And for the instant additional
reason,  it  was  submitted,  that  unilateral  talaq  in  the  nature  of
talaq-e-biddat,  whereby,  a Muslim  woman’s  status  was  associated  with
adverse civil consequences, on the unilateral determination of the male
spouse, by way of a private declaration, must be considered (-and therefore,
be held) as clearly unsustainable in law.
50.Mr. Salman Khurshid, Senior Advocate, appearing as an intervener,
submitted, that for searching a solution to a conflict, or for the resolution of
a concern under Islamic law, reference had first to be made to the Quran.
The availability of an answer to the disagreement, from the text of the
Quran, has to be treated as a final pronouncement on the issue.  When
there is no clear guidance from the Quran, reference must be made to the
traditions of the Prophet Muhammad – ‘sunna’, as recorded in the ‘hadiths’.
If no guidance is available on the issue, even from the ‘hadiths’, reference
must then be made to the general consensus of opinion – ‘ijma’.  If a
resolution to the dispute is found in ‘ijma’, it should be considered as a final
95view on the conflicting issue, under Islamic law.  It was submitted, that the
precaution that needed to be adopted while referring to ‘hadiths’ or ‘ijma’
was, that neither of the two can derogate from the position depicted in the
Quran.  
51.Learned senior counsel, then invited our attention to different kinds
of ‘talaq’, including ‘ila’, ‘zihar’, ‘khula’ and ‘mubaarat’.  It was emphasised,
that the concept of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ (also described as irregular talaq), was
based on the limit of three talaqs available to a man, namely, that a man
can divorce the same wife (woman) three times in his life time.  The first two
are revocable within the period of ‘iddat’, whereas, the third talaq was
irrevocable.  Learned senior counsel, then invited the Court’s attention to
verses from the Quran (-for details, refer to Part-3 – The Holy Quran, with
reference to ‘talaq’).  However, during the course of his submissions, learned
senior counsel emphasized the fact, that mere repetition of divorce thrice in
one  sitting,  would  not  result  in  a  final  severance  of  the  matrimonial
relationship between spouses.  In order to support his above contention,
reliance was placed on the following traditions, from Sunna Muslim:
“i. [3652] 1 – (1471)  It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that he divorced his
wife while she was menstruating, at the time of the Messenger of Allah
‘Umar bin Al-Khattâb asked the Messenger of Allah about that and the
Messenger of Allah said to him: “Tell him to take her back, then wait
until she has become pure, then menstruated again, then become pure
again.  Then if he wishes he may keep her, or if he wishes he may divorce
her before he has intercourse with her .  That is the ‘Iddah (prescribed
periods) for which Allah has enjoined the divorce of women.”
ii. [3673] 15 – (1472)  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbâs said: “During the
time of the Messenger of Allah it, Abü Bakr and the first two years of
‘Umar’s Khjlâfah, a threefold divorce (giving divorce thrice in one sitting)
was counted as one .  Then ‘Umar bin Al-Khattâb said : ‘People have
become hasty in a matter in which they should take their time.  I am
thinking of holding them to it.’  So he made it binding upon them.”
96iii.  [3674]  16  –  (…)  Ibn  Tawüs  narrated  from  his  father  that  Abü
As-Sahbâ’ said to Ibn ‘Abbâs: “Do you know that the threefold divorce
was regarded as one at the time of the Messenger of Allah iW and Abü
Bakr, and for three years of ‘Umar’s leadership? “He said: “Yes” .
iv. [3675] 17 – (…) It was narrated from Tawüs that AN As-Sahbâ’ said to
Ibn ‘Abbâs: “Tell us of something interesting that you know.  Wasn’t the
threefold divorce counted as one at the time of the Messenger of Allah
and Abü Bakr?”  He said: “That was so, then at the time of ‘Umar the
people began to issue divorces frequently, so he made it binding upon
them.
v.“Mahmud-b,  Labeed  reported  that  the  Messenger  of  Allah  was
informed about a man who gave three divorces at a time to his wife.
Then he got up enraged and said, ‘Are you playing with the Book of Allah
who is great and glorious while I am still amongst you?  So much so that
a man got up and said; shall I not kill him.” 
vi.According to an Hadith quoted by M. Mohammed Ali in Manual of
Hadeth p. 2861 from  Masnad of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbul 1:34, the
procedure during the time of Prophet and the caliphate of Abu Bakr, and
the first two years of Hazrat Umar was that divorce uttered thrice was
considered as one divorce .  The Umar said, “people had made haste in a
matter in which that was moderation for them, so we may make it take
effect with regard to them.  So he made it take effect to them.”  The Holy
Quran is however very clear on the point that such a divorce must be
deemed to be a single divorce .
vii.There is another tradition reported by Rokanah-b.  Abu Yazid that
he gave his wife Sahalmash an irrevocable divorce, and he conveyed it to
the Messenger of Allah and said: by Allah, I have not intended but one
divorce.  Then messenger of Allah asked Have you not intended but one
(divorce)?  Rokana said: By Allah, I did not intend but one divorce.  The
Messenger  of  Allah  then  returned  her  back  to  him.   Afterwards  he
divorced her for second time at the time of Hadrat Omar and third time
at the time of Hadrat Osman.
viii.The  Quranic  philosophy  of  divorce  is  further  buttressed  by the
Hadith of the Prophet wherein he warned, ‘of all things which have been
permitted, divorce is the most hated by Allah’.  The Prophet told his
people: “Al-Talaqu indallah-I abghad al-mubahat”, meaning “Divorce is
most detestable in the sight of God; abstain from it .”
ix.[2005] 43 – (867)  It was narrated that Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh said:
“When the Messenger of Allah delivered a Khutbah, his eyes would turn
red, his voice would become loud, and his anger would increase, until it
was as if he was warning of an attacking army, saying: ‘The enemy will
attack in the morning or in the evening.’  He said: ‘The Hour and I have
been sent like these two,’ and he held his index finger and middle finger
up together.  And he would say: ‘The best of speech is the Book of Allah,
the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the worst of
matters are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a
going astray.’  Then he would say: ‘I am closer to every believer than his
own self.  Whoever leaves behind wealth, it is for his family; whoever
97leaves behind a debt or dependants, then the responsibility of paying it
off and of caring for them rests upon me.
x. [2006] 44 – (…) Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh said: “In the Khutbah of the
Prophet on Friday,  he  would  praise Allah, then  he  would say other
things, raising his voice…” a similar Hadith (as no.2005).
xi. [4796] 59 – (1852) It was narrated that Ziyâd bin ‘Ilâqah said: “I heard
‘Arfajah say: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah say: “There will be Fitnah
and  innovations.   Whoever  wants  to  divide  this  Ummah  when  it  is
united, strike him with the sword, no matter who he is.”
xii. [4797] (…) A similar report (as no.2796) was narrated from ‘Arfajah
from the Prophet, except that in their Hadith it says: “…kill him”.”
Based on the above, it was submitted, that in terms of the clear message in
the Quran, the acts and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad are to be
obeyed.  Therefore, when the aforementioned ‘hadiths’ are available stating
in  clear  terms,  that  the  Prophet  Muhammad,  considered  the
pronouncement of three divorces in one sitting as one, that should be given
due expression.  It was the contention of learned senior counsel, that it is
reported, that when once news was brought to the Prophet Muhammad,
that one of his disciples had divorced his wife, by pronouncing three talaqs
at one and the same time, the Prophet Muhammad stood up in anger and
declared that the man was making a plaything of the words of God, and
made  him  take  back  his  wife.   The  instance,  which  is  supported  by
authentic support  through  available  text,  according   to  learned  senior
counsel, was sufficient by itself, to dispose of the present controversy.
52.It was also submitted, that even if one examines the deeds of the
Prophet Muhammad’s companions, it was quite clear from the ‘hadiths’,
that the same were followed during Caliph Abu Bakr’s time, and also during
the  first  two  years  of  Caliph  Umar.   But  thereafter,  only  to  meet  an
exigency, Caliph Umar started accepting the practice of pronouncing three
98divorces in one sitting, as final and irrevocable.  Insofar as the instant
aspect of the matter is concerned, learned senior counsel narrated the
following background:
“(a) Caliph Umar, finding that the checks imposed by the Prophet on the
facility of repudiation interfered with the indulgence of their caprice,
endeavoured to find an escape from the strictness of the law, and found
in the pliability of the jurists a loophole to effect their purpose.
(b)  When  the  Arabs  conquered  Syria,  Egypt,  Perisa,  etc.  they  found
women there much better in appearance as compared to Arabian women
and hence they wanted to marry them.  But the Egyptian and Syrian
women insisted that in order to marry them, they should divorce their
existing wives instantaneously, by pronouncing three divorces in one
sitting.
(c) The condition was readily acceptable to the Arabs, because they knew
that in Islam divorce was permissible only twice in two separate period of
tuhr and its repetition in one sitting was considered un-Islamic, void and
not effective.  In this way, they could not only marry these women, but
also retain their existing wives.  This fact was reported to the second
Caliph Hazrat Umar.
(d)  The Caliph Umar then, in order to prevent misuse of the religion by
the unscrupulous husbands decreed, that even repetition of the word
talaq, talaq, talaq at one sitting, would dissolve the marriage irrevocably.
It was, however, a mere administrative measure of Caliph Umar, to meet
an emergency situation, and not to make it a legally binding precedent
permanently.”
53.It was also the contention of learned senior counsel, that Hanafi
jurists who considered three pronouncements at one sitting, as amounting
to a final divorce explained, that in those days people did not actually mean
three divorces but meant only one divorce, and other two pronouncements
were meant merely to emphasise the first pronouncement.  But in the
contemporary era, three pronouncements were made with the intention to
effect three separate and distinct declarations, and hence, they were not to
be counted as a singular announcement.  This interpretation of the Hanafi
jurists, it was submitted, was generally not acceptable, as it went against
the very spirit of the Quran, as well as, the ‘hadith’ which enjoin, that in
99case of breach between husband and wife, it should be referred to the
arbitration, and failing an amicable settlement, a divorce was permissible,
subject to a period of waiting or ‘idaat’, during which a reconciliation was
also to be attempted, and if successful, the husband could take back his
wife.  The main idea in the procedure for divorce, as laid down by Islam, it
was submitted, was to give the parties an opportunity for repproachment. If
three pronouncements are treated as a ‘mughallazah’ – divorce, then no
opportunity is available to the spouses, to retrieve a decision taken in haste.
The rule of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, it was pointed out, was introduced long after the
time  of  the  Prophet.   It  was  submitted,  that  it  renders  the  measures
provided for in the Quran against hasty action ineffective, and thereby
deprives people of a chance to change their minds, to retrieve their mistakes
and retain their wives.
54.Based on the above submissions, it was contended, that though
matters of religion have periodically come before courts in India, and the
issues  have  been  decided  in  the  context  of  Articles  25  and  26  of  the
Constitution.  Raising concerns over issues of empowerment of all citizens
and gender justice, it was submitted, had increased the demand on courts
to respond to new challenges.  The present slew of cases, it was pointed out,
was a part of that trend.  It was submitted, that the Supreme Court could
not refuse to engage itself, on the ground that the issues involved have
political overtones or motives, and also because, they might pertain to a
narrow constitutional permissibility.  It was contended, that to refuse an
invitation to examine broader issues such as whether ‘personal laws’ were
100part of ‘laws in force’ under Article 13, and therefore, subject to judicial
review, or whether a uniform civil code should be enforced, would not be
appropriate.  It was submitted, if the immediate concern about triple talaq
could  be  addressed,  by  endorsing  a  more  acceptable  alternate
interpretation, based on a pluralistic reading of the sources of Islam, i.e., by
taking a holistic view of the Quran and the ‘hadith’ as indicated by various
schools of thought (not just the Hanafi school), it would be sufficient for the
purpose  of  ensuring  justice  to  the  petitioners,  and  others  similarly
positioned as them.
55.In support of his above submissions, learned senior counsel placed
reliance on legislative changes with reference to ‘talaq-e-biddat’ all over the
world  (-for  details,  refer  to  Part-5  –  Abrogation   of  the  practice  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’  by  legislation,  the  world  over,  in  Islamic,  as  well  as,
non-Islamic States).  Reliance was also placed on judicial pronouncements,
rendered by different High Courts with reference to ‘talaq-e-biddat’ (-for
details,  refer  to  Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’), so as to conclude, that triple talaq pronounced at the same
time  should  be  treated  as  a  single  pronouncement  of  divorce,  and
thereafter,  for  severing  matrimonial  ties,  the  husband  would  have  to
complete  the  prescribed  procedure  provided  for
‘talaq-e-ahsan’/‘talaq-e-hasan’, and only thereafter, the parties would be
treated as divorced.
56.While advancing his aforesaid contention, there was also a note of
caution expressed by learned senior counsel.  It was pointed out, that it was
101not the role of a court, to interpret Muslim ‘personal law’ – Shariat.  It was
asserted, that under Muslim ‘personal law’, the religious head – the Imam
would be called upon, to decipher the teachings of the Quran and the
‘hadiths’  in  case  of  a  conflict.   And  thereupon,  the  Imam  had  the
responsibility to resolve issues of conflict, not on the basis of his own views,
but by reading the verses, namely, the Quran and the ‘hadiths’, and to
determine therefrom, the correct interpretation.  It was submitted, that the
role of a court, not being a body well versed in the intricacies of faith, would
not extend to an interpretation of either the Quran or the ‘hadiths’, and
therefore, ‘talaq-e-biddat’ should also be interpreted on the touchstone of
reasonableness, in tune with the prevailing societal outlook.
57.Ms.  Nitya  Ramakrishna,  Advocate,  appeared  on  behalf  of
respondent no.11 (in Writ Petition (C) No.118 of 2016) - Dr.  Noorjehan
Safia Niaz, who was impleaded as such, by an order dated 29.6.2016.  It
was submitted  by learned counsel,  that ‘talaq-e-biddat’  was a mode of
divorce that operated instantaneously.  It was contended, that the practice
of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, was absolutely invalid even in terms of Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was submitted, that it was not required of this Court to
strike down the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, it was submitted, that it would
suffice if this Court merely upholds the order passed by the Delhi High
Court in the Masroor Ahmed case4, by giving a meaningful interpretation to
‘talaq-e-biddat’, which would be in consonance with the verses of the Quran
and the relevant ‘hadiths’.
10258.It was also asserted by learned counsel, that Islam from its very
inception recognized rights of women, which were not available to women of
other  communities.   It  was  pointed  out,  that  the  right  of  divorce  was
conferred on Muslim women, far before this right was conferred on women
belonging to other  communities.  It was asserted, that even in the 7th
century, Islam granted women the right of divorce and remarriage.  The
aforesaid legal right, according to learned counsel, was recognized by the
British, when it promulgated the Shariat Act in 1937.  It was submitted,
that through the above legislation all customs and usages contrary to the
Muslim ‘personal  law’ – ‘Shariat’, were unequivocally annulled.  It was
therefore contended, that while evaluating the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
this Court should be conscious of the fact, that the Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’, was a forward looking code of conduct, regulating various features
in the lives of those who professed the Muslim religion.
59.It  was  also  submitted,  that  the  Quran  did  not  recognize
‘talaq-e-biddat’.   It  was  pointed  out,  that  the  Prophet  Muhammad
considered only two forms of divorce to be valid, namely, ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and
‘talaq-e-hasan’.  Despite  there  being  numerous  schools  of  Muslim
jurisprudence, only two schools recognized ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as a mode of
divorce.  It was submitted, that none of the Shia schools recognized triple
talaq,  as  a  valid  process  of  divorce  between  spouses.   Insofar  as
‘talaq-e-biddat’  is  concerned,  it was  asserted, that the Quran does not
approve instantaneous talaq.  During the  process of initiation of divorce and
its finalization, it is necessarily to have a time lag and a timeline.  It cannot
103be instantaneous.  It was pointed out, that the time lag is the period of
‘iddat’  for  determining  whether  the  wife  is  pregnant  or  not,  i.e.,  for
ascertaining the wife’s purity.  But the time line, is for adopting arbitration,
to  probe  the  possibility of  reconciliation.   ‘Talaq-e-biddat’,  according to
learned counsel, was a subsequent improvisation, that had crept into the
Hanafi school of Sunnis.  It was asserted, that the British judges prior to
independence, made a huge blunder by upholding ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple
talaq.  Learned counsel placed reliance on a number of judgments rendered
by different High Courts, culminating in the recent judgments of three High
Courts  (-for  details,  refer  to  Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the
subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’).  
60.Based on the above, it was asserted, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ could not
be considered as a valid mode for severing matrimonial ties under the
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  In view of the above submissions, and on
a reiteration of the submissions advanced by learned counsel who had
entered  appearance  prior  to  her,  it  was  submitted,  that  the  clear
preponderance of judicial opinion after independence of India has been, that
Muslim ‘personal law’, does not approve ‘talaq-e-biddat’, and therefore, in
terms  of  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’,  this  Court  should  declare
‘talaq-e-biddat’,  as  unacceptable  in  law,  and  should  also  declare  it  as
unconstitutional.
61.Dr. Rajan Chandra and Mr. Arif Mohd. Khan, Advocates, appeared
on  behalf  of  the  Muslim  Women  Personal  Law  Board.   It  was  their
contention, that it has been acknowledged by all concerned, including the
104AIMPLB, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was derogatory to the dignity of women, and
that, it breaches the concept of gender equality.  It was submitted, that the
above position could easily be remedied through judicial intervention.  In
this behalf, our attention was drawn to Article 13 of the Constitution, which
mandates, that all laws in force in the territory of India (immediately before
the  commencement  of  the  Constitution),  as  were  inconsistent  with  the
Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution, were to the
extent of such inconsistency, to be treated as void.  The above declaration,
it  was  pointed  out,  had  to  be  expressed  through  legislation,  by  the
Parliament, and in case the Parliament was reluctant in bringing out such a
legislation (-presumably, for political considerations), it was the bounden
duty of this Court, to declare such existing laws which were derogatory to
the dignity of women, and which violated the concept of gender equality, as
void, on account of their being in conflict with the fundamental rights
contained in Part III of the Constitution. Both learned counsel, invited our
attention to the legislative march of events commencing from the enactment
of the Shariat Act in 1937, by the British rulers of India, who took upon
themselves, extreme cudgels to initiate the grant of appropriate rights to
women.  As also, the enactment of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act,
1939  (again  during  the  British  regime),  whereby,  Muslim  women  were
conferred with a right to divorce their husbands, on eight distinct grounds.
It was submitted, that the protection of Muslim women’s rights, which
needed to have continued even after independence, had remained stagnant,
resulting in insurmountable sufferings to the Muslim women, specially in
105comparison  with  women  of  other  faiths.   One  of  the  grounds  of  such
suffering, it was pointed out, was surely ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq, which
has been a matter of substantial furore and outcry at the hands of Muslim
women.   During  the  course  of  hearing,  our  attention  was  drawn  to
fundamentals of Islam from the Quran (-for details, refer to Part-3 – The
Holy Quran – with reference to ‘talaq’), and ‘hadiths’.  Views of Imams on
‘fiqh’ and ‘hadith’ and other relevant texts were referred to (as were also
relied upon by learned counsel who appeared before them – and have been
duly referred to above), to contend that triple talaq had never been accepted
as  a  valid  means  of  divorce,  even  under  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’.
Adopting the submissions of learned counsel, who had already assisted this
Court on behalf of the petitioners, it was submitted, that this Court should
declare ‘talaq-e-biddat’, as unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14 and
15 of the Constitution.
62.The  learned  Attorney  General  for  India  –  Mr.  Mukul  Rohatgi
commenced his submissions by contending, that in this case, this Court
has been called upon to determine, whether the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’
was  compatible  with  contemporary  constitutional  morality  and  the
principles  of  gender  equality  and  gender  equity  guaranteed  under  the
Constitution.  In the context of the above debate, it was submitted, that the
pivotal issue that needed to be answered was, whether under a secular
Constitution, Muslim women could be discriminated against, merely by
virtue of their religious identity.  And/or whether Muslim women, could be
relegated to a status significantly more vulnerable than their counterparts
106who professed other faiths - Hindu, Christian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, Sikh,
Jain, etc..  In other words, the fundamental question for determination by
this Court, according to learned Attorney General was, whether in a secular
democracy, religion can be a reason to deny equal status and dignity, to
Muslim women. 
63.In the above context, it was pointed out, that the fundamental right
to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution, manifested
within its fold, equality of status.  Gender equality, gender equity and
gender justice, it was submitted, were values intrinsically entwined in the
guarantee of equality, under Article 14.  The conferment of a social status
based on patriarchal values, or a social status based on the mercy of the
men-folk, it was contended, were absolutely incompatible with the letter
and spirit of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.  The rights of a Muslim
woman to human dignity, social esteem and self-worth, it was submitted,
were vital facets of a woman’s right to life with dignity, under Article 21 of
the Constitution.  It was submitted, that gender justice was a constitutional
goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing
the same, half of the country’s citizenry, would not be able to enjoy to the
fullest - their rights, status and opportunities. Reference was also made to
clause (e) of Article 51-A of the Constitution, which is extracted below:
“(e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst
all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or
sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of
women;”
107It was accordingly asserted, that Muslim women could not be subjected to
arbitrary and unilateral whims of their husbands, as in the case of divorce
by triple talaq amongst Shia Muslims belonging to the Hanafi school.
64.It was submitted, that gender equality and the dignity of women,
were non-negotiable.  These rights were necessary, not only to realize the
aspirations  of  every individual  woman,  who  is  an  equal  citizen  of  this
country, but also, for the larger well being of society and the progress of the
nation, one half of which is made up by women.  It was submitted, that
women  deserved  to  be  equal  participants  in  the  development  and
advancement of  the world’s  largest democracy, and  any practice which
denudes the status of an inhabitant of India, merely by virtue of the religion
he/she happens to profess, must be considered as an impediment to that
larger goal.  In this behalf, reliance was placed on C. Masilamani Mudaliar
v. Idol of Sri Swaminathaswami Thirukoil28,  wherein a 3-Judge Bench of
this Court observed as under:
“15. It is seen that if after the Constitution came into force, the right to
equality  and  dignity  of  person  enshrined  in  the  Preamble  of  the
Constitution, Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles which are a
trinity intended to remove discrimination or disability on grounds only of
social status or gender, removed the pre-existing impediments that stood
in  the  way  of  female  or  weaker  segments  of  the  society .  In S.R.
Bommai v. Union  of  India  [(1994)  3 SCC  1]  this Court held that the
Preamble is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Handicaps
28
108should be removed only under rule of law to enliven the trinity of justice,
equality  and  liberty  with  dignity  of  person.  The  basic  structure
permeates  equality  of  status  and  opportunity.  The  personal  laws
conferring inferior status on women is anathema to equality. Personal
laws  are  derived  not  from  the  Constitution  but  from  the  religious
scriptures.  The  laws  thus  derived  must  be  consistent  with  the
Constitution  lest  they  become  void  under  Article  13  if  they  violate
fundamental rights. Right to equality is a fundamental right …. 
16. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a declaration on
4-12-1986 on “The Development of the Right to Development” in which
India played a crusading role for its adoption and ratified the same. Its
preamble recognises that all human rights and fundamental freedoms
are indivisible and interdependent . All Nation States are concerned at the
existence of serious obstacles to development and complete fulfilment of
human beings, denial of civil, political, economic, social and cultural
rights. In order to promote development, equal attention should be given
to  the  implementation,  promotion  and  protection  of  civil,  political,
economic, social and political rights.
17. Article 1(1) assures right to development an inalienable human right,
by virtue of which every person and all people are entitled to participate
in,  contribute  to,  and  enjoy  economic,  social,  cultural  and  political
development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can
be fully realised. Article 6(1) obligates the State to observance of all
human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  for  all  without  any
discrimination  as  to  race,  sex,  language  or religion.  Sub-article  (2)
enjoins that … equal attention and urgent consideration should be given
to  implement,  promotion  and  protection  of  civil,  political,  economic,
social and political rights. Sub-article (3) thereof enjoins that:
“State  should  take  steps  to  eliminate  obstacle  to  development,
resulting from failure  to observe civil and political rights as well as
economic, social and economic rights. Article 8 casts duty on the State to
undertake,  …  necessary  measures  for  the  realisation  of  right  to
development and ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their
access to basic resources … and distribution of income.”
Effective measures should be undertaken to ensure that women have an
active role in the development process. Appropriate economic and social
reforms should be carried out with a view to eradicate all social injustice.
18. Human rights are derived from the dignity and worth inherent in the
human  person.  Human  rights  and  fundamental  freedom  have  been
reiterated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Democracy,
development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
are interdependent and have mutual reinforcement.  The human rights
for women, including girl child are, therefore, inalienable, integral and
indivisible  part  of  universal  human  rights.  The  full  development  of
personality and fundamental freedoms and equal participation by women
in  political,  social,  economic  and  cultural  life  are  concomitants  for
national development, social and family stability and growth, culturally,
109socially and economically. All forms of discrimination on grounds of
gender is violative of fundamental freedoms and human rights .”
Reference  was  also  made  to  Anuj  Garg  v.  Hotel  Association  of  India29,
wherein it was submitted, that this Court had emphasized on the value of
gender equality, and the need to discard patriarchal mindset.  For arriving
at the above conclusion, it was submitted, that this Court had relied upon
international jurisprudence, to strike down a law which debarred women
from employment on the pretext that the object of the law was, to afford
them protection.  The Court held that “it is for the court to review that the
majoritarian impulses rooted in moralistic tradition do not impinge upon
individual  autonomy  (of  the  women)”.   The  Court  also  quoted  from  a
judgment of the U.S. Supreme Court where discrimination was rationalized
“by an attitude of ‘romantic paternalism’ which, in practical effect, put
women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage…”.  Reference was also made to
Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan30, wherein, in the context of protection of
women against sexual harassment at  the workplace, this Court underlined
the right of women to a life with dignity. Additionally, our attention was
drawn to the Charu Khurana case15, wherein it was concluded, that the
“sustenance  of gender  justice  is the cultivated achievement of  intrinsic
human rights and that there cannot be any discrimination solely on the
ground  of  gender.”   The  learned  Attorney  General  also  cited,  Githa
Hariharan v. Reserve Bank of India31, wherein this Court had the occasion
to interpret the provisions of the  Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act,
29
30
31
1101956.  It was submitted, that this Court in the above judgment emphasized
the  necessity  to  take  measures  to  bring  domestic  law  in  line  with
international conventions, so as to eradicate discrimination of all forms,
against women.  It was submitted, that Articles 14, 15 and 21 consituted an
inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution.  These values –
the  right  to  equality,  non-discrimination  and  the  right  to  live  life  with
dignity, it was emphasized, formed the bedrock of the Constitution.  Gender
equality and dignity for women, it was pointed out, was an inalienable and
inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution.  Since women
transcend all social barriers, it was submitted, that the most fundamental
facet of equality under the Constitution was gender equality, and gender
equity.
65.The learned Attorney General also pointed out, that a large number
of Islamic theocratic countries and countries with overwhelmingly large
Muslim  populations,  had  undertaken  significant  reforms  including  the
practice of triple talaq.  These societies had accepted reform, as being
consistent  with  the  practice  of  Islam  (-for  details,  refer  to  Part-5  –
Abrogation of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by legislation, the world over, in
Islamic, as well as, non-Islamic States).  The paradox was that, Muslim
women in India, were more vulnerable in their social status as against
women even in predominantly Islamic States, even though India is a secular
country.  It was submitted, that the position of Indian Muslim women was
much  worst,  than  Muslim  women  who  live  in  theocratic  societies,  or
countries where Islam is the State religion.  It was contended, that the
111impugned practice was repugnant to the guarantee of secularism, which it
was pointed out, was an essential feature of the Constitution.  Perpetuation
of regressive or unjust practices in the name of religion, it was submitted,
was  anathema  to  a  secular  Constitution,  which  guarantees
non-discrimination on grounds of religion.  It was also submitted, that in
the context of gender equality and gender equity, the larger goal of the State
was, to strive towards the establishment of a social democracy, where each
one was equal to all others.  Reference in this behalf was made to the
closing speech on the draft Constitution on 25th November, 1949, of Dr.
Ambedkar who had stated: “What we must do is not to be attained with
mere political democracy; we must make out political democracy and a
social democracy as well.  Political democracy cannot last unless there lies
on  the  base  of  it  a  social  democracy.”   A  social  democracy  has  been
described as “A way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity
as principles of life”.  It was therefore submitted, that in order to achieve
social democracy, and  in order to provide social and economic justice
(envisaged in the preamble), namely, goals articulated in the fundamental
rights and directive principles, and in particular, Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 38,
39 and 46, had to be given effect to.  In the instant context, the learned
Attorney General placed reliance on Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University32,
and drew the Court’s attention to the following:
“16.The  Constitution  seeks  to  establish  secular  socialist  democratic
republic in which every citizen has equality of status and of opportunity,
to promote among the people dignity of the individual, unity and integrity
of the nation transcending them from caste, sectional, religious barriers
fostering fraternity among them in an integrated Bharat . The emphasis,
32
112therefore, is on a citizen to improve excellence and equal status  and
dignity  of  person.  With  the  advancement  of  human  rights  and
constitutional  philosophy  of  social  and  economic  democracy  in  a
democratic polity to all the citizens on equal footing, secularism has been
held  to  be  one  of  the  basic  features  of  the  Constitution  (Vide:  S.R.
Bommai v. Union of India , (1994) 3 SCC 1 and egalitarian social order is
its foundation. Unless free mobility of the people is allowed transcending
sectional, caste, religious or regional barriers, establishment of secular
socialist order becomes difficult . In State of Karnataka v. Appu Balu
Ingale & Ors., AIR (1993) SC 1126 this Court has held in paragraph 34
that judiciary acts as a bastion of the freedom and of the rights of the
people. The Judges are participants in the living stream of national life,
steering the law between the dangers of rigidity and formlessness in the
seemless web of life. Judge must be a jurist endowed with the legislator's
wisdom,  historian's  search  for  truth,  prophet's  vision,  capacity  to
respond to the needs of the present, resilience to cope with the demands
of the future to decide objectively, disengaging himself/herself from every
personal influence or predilections . The Judges should adapt purposive
interpretation of the dynamic concepts under the Constitution and the
act with its interpretive armoury to articulate the felt necessities of the
time. Social legislation is not a document for fastidious dialects but
means of ordering the life of the people. To construe law one must enter
into its spirit, its setting and history. Law should be capable to expand
freedom of the people and the legal order can weigh with utmost equal
care to provide the underpinning of the highly inequitable social order.
Judicial  review  must  be  exercised  with  insight  into  social  values  to
supplement the changing social needs. The existing social inequalities or
imbalances  are  required  to  be  removed  readjusting  the  social  order
through rule of law .…”
The learned Attorney General then submitted, that in paragraph 20 of the
Valsamma Paul case20, it was noted, that various Hindu practices which
were not in tune with the times, had been done away with, in the interest of
promoting equality and fraternity.  In paragraph 21 of the above judgment,
this Court had emphasized the need to divorce religion from ‘personal law’.
And in paragraph 22, a mention was made about the need to foster a
national identity, which would not deny pluralism of Indian culture, but
would rather preserve it.  Relevant extracts of the aforesaid judgment relied
upon during the course of hearing, are reproduced herein below:
113“21.  The Constitution through its Preamble, Fundamental Rights and
Directive  Principles  created  secular  State  based  on  the  principle  of
equality and non-discrimination striking a balance between the rights of
the individuals and the duty and commitment of the State to establish
an egalitarian social order .  Dr. K.M. Munshi contended on the floor of
the Constituent Assembly that  ""we want to divorce religion from personal
law, from what may be called social relations, or from the rights of
parties as regards inheritance or succession. What have these things got
to do with religion, I fail to understand? We are in a stage where we must
unify and consolidate the nation by every means without interfering with
religious practices. If, however, in the past, religious practices have been
so construed as to cover the whole field of life, we have reached a point
when we must put our foot down and say that these matters are not
religion, they are purely matters for secular legislation. Religion must be
restricted to spheres which legitimately appertain to religion, and the
rest of life must be regulated, unified and modified in such a manner
that we may evolve, as early as possible, a strong and consolidated
nation"" (Vide: Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. VII 356-8).
22. In the onward march of establishing an egalitarian secular social
order  based on equality and dignity of person,  Article 15(1) prohibits
discrimination on grounds of religion or caste identities so as to foster
national identity which does not deny pluralism of Indian culture but
rather to preserve it. Indian culture is a product or blend of several
strains  or  elements  derived  from  various  sources,  in  spite  of
inconsequential  variety  of  forms  and  types.  There  is  unity  of  spirit
informing Indian culture throughout the ages. It is this underlying unity
which is one of the most remarkable everlasting and enduring feature of
Indian culture that fosters unity in diversity among different populace.
This  generates  and  fosters  cordial  spirit  and  toleration  that  make
possible the unity and continuity of Indian traditions. Therefore, it would
be  the  endeavour  of  everyone  to  develop  several  identities  which
constantly  interact  and  overlap,  and  prove  a  meeting  point  for  all
members  of  different  religious  communities,  castes,  sections,
sub-sections and regions to promote rational approach to life and society
and would establish a national composite and cosmopolitan culture and
way of life.”
66.It was also asserted, that patriarchal values and traditional notions
about the role of women in society, were an impediment to the goal for
achieving social democracy.  In this behalf it was contended, that gender
inequity impacts not only women, but had a ripple effect on the rest of the
community, preventing it from shaking out of backwardness and partaking
to the full, liberties guaranteed under the Constitution.  Citizens from all
114communities, it was submitted, had the right to the enjoyment of all the
constitutional guarantees, and if some sections of society were held back, it
was likely to hold back the community at large, resulting in a lopsided
development, with pockets of social backwardness. According to the learned
Attorney General, this kind of lopsided development was not in the larger
interest of the integrity and development of the nation.  It was submitted,
that  secularism,  equality  and  fraternity  being  the  overarching  guiding
principles of all communities, must be given effect to.  This would move the
entire citizenry forward, guaranteeing to women equal rights, and at the
same time, preserving diversity and plurality.  
67.It was the emphatic assertion of the learned Attorney General, that
freedom  of  religion  was  subservient  to  fundamental  rights.   It  was
contended in this behalf, that the words employed in Article 25(1) of the
Constitution, which conferred the right to practice, preach and propagate
religion were “subject to the provisions of this Part”, which meant that the
above rights are subject to Articles 14 and 15, which guarantee equality and
non-discrimination.  In other words, under India’s secular Constitution, the
right to freedom of religion was subject to, and in that sense, subservient to
other  fundamental  rights  –  such  as  the  right  to  equality,  the  right  to
non-discrimination,  and  the  right  to  life  with  dignity.   In  this  behalf
reference was made to Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. State of Mysore33.  In
this judgment, it was submitted, that this Court considered the meaning of
the  phrase  “subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  Part”  in  Article  25(1)  to
33
115conclude, that the other provisions of the Part would “prevail over” and
would “control the right conferred” by Article 25(1).
68.In the above context it was also submitted, that the freedom of
religion, expressed in Article 25 of the Constitution was, not confined to the
male gender.  Article 25 is extracted below:
“25. Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation
of religion. – (1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the
other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom
of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate
religion.
(2) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or
prevent the State from making any law – 
(a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other
secular activity which may be associated with religious practice;
(b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu
religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of
Hindus. 
Explanation I.-  The wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to
be included in the profession of the Sikh religion.
Explanation II.- In sub-clause (b) of clause reference to Hindus shall be
construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina
or Buddhist religion, and the reference to Hindu religious institutions
shall be construed accordingly.”
It was highlighted, that it was also necessary to note, that Article 25(1)
provides  that  “all”  persons  were  “equally”  entitled  to  the  freedom  of
conscience, and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion.  This,
according to the learned Attorney General, should be understood to mean,
that the rights conferred by this article were equally available to women,
and were not confined to men alone.  Therefore, it was contended, that any
patriarchal or one sided interpretation of religion (or a practice of religion),
ought not to be countenanced.  
69.It was emphasised by the learned Attorney General, that it was
necessary to draw a line between religion per se, and religious practices.  It
116was  submitted,  that  the  latter  were  not  protected  under  Article  25.
“Religion”, according to the learned Attorney General, has been explained by
this Court in A.S. Narayana Deekshitulu v. State of A.P.34, as under :
“86.  A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs and
doctrine  which  are  regarded  by  those  who  profess  religion  to  be
conducive  to  their  spiritual  well-being.   A  religion  is  not  merely an
opinion, doctrine or belief.  It has outward expression in acts as well.  It
is not every aspect of religion that has been safeguarded by Articles 25
and 26 nor has the Constitution provided that every religious activity
cannot be interfered with.  Religion, therefore, cannot be construed in
the context of Articles 25 and 26 in its strict and etymological sense.
Every  religion  must  believe  in  a  conscience  and  ethical  and  moral
precepts.  Therefore, whatever binds a man to his own conscience and
whatever moral or ethical principles regulate the lives of men believing in
that theistic, conscience or  religious  belief  that alone  can constitute
religion  as  understood  in  the  Constitution  which  fosters  feeling  of
brotherhood, amity, fraternity and equality of all persons which find their
foothold in secular aspect of the Constitution .  Secular activities and
aspects do not constitute religion which brings under its own cloak every
human activity.  There is nothing which a man can do, whether in the
way of wearing clothes  or  food  or  drink,  which is  not considered  a
religious activity.  Every mundane or human activity was not intended to
be  protected  by  the  Constitution  under  the  guise  of  religion.   The
approach to construe the protection of religion or matters of religion or
religious practices guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 must be viewed with
pragmatism since by the very nature of things, it would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to define the expression religion or matters of
religion or religious belief or practice .  
87. In pluralistic society like India, as stated earlier, there are numerous
religious  groups  who  practise  diverse  forms  of  worship  or  practise
religions, rituals, rites etc., even among Hindus, different denominants
and  sects  residing  within  the  country  or  abroad  profess  different
religious faiths, beliefs, practices.  They seek to identify religion with
what may in substance be mere facets of religion.  It would, therefore, be
difficult to devise a definition of religion which would be regarded as
applicable to all religions or matters of religious practices.  To one class
of persons a mere dogma or precept or a doctrine may be predominant in
the  matter  of  religion;  to  others,  rituals  or  ceremonies  may  be
34
117predominant facets of religion; and to yet another class or persons a code
of conduct or a mode of life may constitute religion .  Even to different
persons professing the same religious faith some of the facets or religion
may have varying significance.  It may not be possible, therefore, to
devise a precise definition of universal application as to what is religion
and what are matters of religious belief or religious practice.  That is far
from saying that it is not possible to state with reasonable certainty the
limits within which the Constitution conferred a right to profess religion.
Therefore, the right to religion guaranteed under Article 25 or 26 is not
an absolute or unfettered right to propagating religion which is subject to
legislation by the State limiting or regulating any activity – economic,
financial, political or secular which are associated with religious belief,
faith, practice or custom .  They are subject to reform on social welfare by
appropriate legislation by the State.  Though religious practices and
performances of acts in pursuance of religious belief are as much a part
of religion as faith or belief in a particular doctrine, that by itself is not
conclusive or decisive.   What are essential parts of religion or religious
belief  or  matters  or  religion  and  religious  practice  is  essentially  a
question of fact to be considered in the context in which the question has
arisen and the evidence – factual or legislative or historic – presented in
that context is required to be considered and a decision reached .”
In order to support the above view, the Court’s attention was also drawn to
the Javed case10, wherein this Court observed as under :
“49.  In State of Bombay  v. Narasu Appa Mali  [AIR 1952 Bom 84:53 Cri
LJ 354] the constitutional validity of the Bombay Prevention of Hindu
Bigamous Marriages Act (25 of 1946) was challenged on the ground of
violation of Articles 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution. A Division Bench,
consisting of Chief Justice Chagla and Justice Gajendragadkar (as His
Lordship then was), held: 
“A sharp distinction must be drawn between religious faith and belief
and religious practices. What the State protects is religious faith and
belief.  If religious practices  run  counter to  public  order, morality or
health or a policy of social welfare upon which the State has embarked,
then the religious practices must give way before the good of the people
of the State as a whole .”
50. Their Lordships quoted from American decisions that the laws are
made for the governance of actions, and while they cannot interfere with
mere  religious  beliefs  and  opinions,  they  may  with  practices.  Their
Lordships found it difficult to accept the proposition that polygamy is an
integral  part  of  Hindu  religion  though  Hindu  religion  recognizes  the
necessity of a son for religious efficacy and spiritual salvation. However,
proceeding on an assumption that polygamy is a recognized institution
according  to  Hindu  religious  practice,  Their  Lordships  stated  in  no
uncertain terms: 
118“The right of the State to legislate on questions relating to marriage
cannot be disputed.  Marriage  is  undoubtedly  a social  institution  an
institution in which the State is vitally interested. Although there may
not be universal recognition of the fact, still a very large volume of
opinion in the world today admits that monogamy is a very desirable and
praiseworthy  institution.  If,  therefore,  the  State  of  Bombay  compels
Hindus to become monogamists, it is a measure of social reform, and if it
is a measure of social reform then the State is empowered to legislate
with regard to social reform under Article 25(2)( b) notwithstanding the
fact that it may interfere with the right of a citizen freely to profess,
practise and propagate religion.”
It  was  further  submitted,  that  practices  such  as  polygamy  cannot  be
described  as  being  sanctioned  by  religion,  inasmuch  as,  historically
polygamy prevailed across communities for several centuries, including the
ancient  Greeks  and  Romans,  Hindus,  Jews  and  Zoroastrians.   It  was
pointed out, that polygamy had less to do with religion, and more to do with
social norms of that time.  In the Quran as well, it was contended, it
appears that the prevalence (or perhaps, rampant practice) of polygamy in
pre-Islamic society, was sought to be regulated and restricted, so as to treat
women  better  than  they  were  treated  in  pre-Islamic  times.   It  was
submitted, that the practice of polygamy was a social practice rather than a
religious one, and therefore, would not be protected under Article 25.  It was
sought to be explained, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was similarly a practice never
clearly recognized, nor was it seen with favour, and needed to be examined
in the background of the above narrated historic position.   
70.In order to be able to seek interference, with reference to the issue
canvassed, and in order to surmount the legal object in advancing his
contentions, the learned Attorney General pointed out, that there was an
apparent misconstruction, which had led to the conclusions drawn by the
119Bombay High Court, in State of Bombay v. Narasu Appa Mali35.  It was
submitted, that ‘personal laws’ ought to be examined, in the light of the
overarching goal of gender justice, and dignity of women.  The underlying
idea  behind  the  preservation  of  ‘personal  laws’  was,  to  safeguard  the
plurality and diversity among the people of India.  However, the sustenance
of such diverse identities, according to the learned Attorney General, cannot
be a pretext for denying women their rightful status and gender equality.  It
was submitted, that ‘personal law’ was a part and parcel of “law” within the
meaning of Article 13.  And therefore, any such law (‘personal law’) which
was inconsistent with fundamental rights, would have to be considered
void.  It was further submitted, that the interpretation of the Bombay High
Court in the Narasu Appa Mali case23, to the effect that Article 13 of the
Constitution, would not cover ‘personal laws’ warranted reconsideration.
Firstly, it was contended, that a reading of the plain language adopted in
Article 13 would clearly establish that ‘personal law’, as well as customs
and usages, were covered within the scope of “law”.  Article 13 reads as
under: 
“13. Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights.-
(1) All  laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the
commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent
with  the  provisions  of  this  Part,  shall,  to  the  extent  of  such
inconsistency, be void.

120(2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the
rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this
clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void. 
(3)  In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,-
(a) “  law” includes any Ordinance, order, bye law, rule, regulation,
notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the
force of law; 
(b)“  laws in force” includes laws passed or made by a Legislature or
other  competent  authority  in  the  territory  of  India  before  the
commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed,
notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be
then in operation either at all or in particular areas .
(4)  Nothing  in  this  article  shall  apply  to  any  amendment  of  this
Constitution made under article 368.”
It was submitted, that the meaning of “law” as defined in clauses (2) and (3)
of Article 13 is not exhaustive, and should be read as if it encompassed
within its scope, ‘personal law’ as well.  It was submitted, that under clause
(2) of Article 246 of the Constitution, Parliament and State Legislatures had
the power to make laws, also on the subject enumerated in entry 5 of the
Concurrent  List  in  the  Seventh  Schedule,  pertaining  to  “Marriage  and
divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills; intestacy and succession; joint
family and partition; all matters in respect of which parties in judicial
proceedings  were  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  this
Constitution subject to their personal law.”  Since the subjects expressed in
entry 5 aforementioned, were relatable to ‘personal law’, therefore, ‘personal
law’, according to the learned Attorney General, was liable to include law
within the meaning of sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of Article 13 of the
Constitution. The observations of the Bombay High Court in the Narasu
Appa Mali case23, it was contended, were contrary to the plain language of
Article 13.  Secondly, it was submitted, the plain language of Article 13(3)(a)
which  defines  “law”  as  including “any…custom  or  usage  having in  the
121territory of India the force of law”, left no room for any doubt, on the issue.
It was pointed out, that the observations in the Narasu Appa Mali case23,
were in the nature of obiter, and could not be considered as the ratio of the
judgment.  Further more, the said judgment, being a judgment of a High
Court, was not binding on this Court.  Without prejudice to the above,
according  to  the  learned  Attorney  General,  the  said  practices  under
challenge had been incorporated into the Muslim ‘personal law’ by the
Shariat Act.  It was reasoned, that the Shariat Act, was clearly a “law in
force”, within the meaning of Article 13(3)(b).  It was submitted, that the
petitioner  has  challenged  Section  2  of  the  aforesaid  Act,  insofar  as  it
recognises and validates the practices of triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat (nikah
halala and polygamy).  Therefore, even assuming (for the sake of argument),
that these practices do not constitute customs, the same were nonetheless
manifestly covered by Article 13.  
71.It  was  acknowledged,  that  the  legal  position  expressed  in  the
Narasu  Appa  Mali  case23 had  been  affirmed  by this  Court,  on  various
occasions.   Rather  than  recording  the  learned  Attorney  General’s
submissions in our words, we would extract the position acknowledged in
the written submissions filed on behalf of the Union of India, in this matter,
below:
“(e) Pertinently, despite this ruling that was later followed in Krishna
Singh v. Mathura Ahir, (1981) 3 SCC 689 and Maharshi Avdhesh v.
Union of India, (1994) Supp (1) SCC 713, the Supreme Court has actively
tested personal laws on the touchstone of fundamental rights in cases
such as Daniel Latifi v. Union of India, (2001) 7 SCC 740 (5-Judge
Bench), Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum, (1985) 2 SCC 556
(5-Judge Bench), John Vallamatom v. Union of India, (2003) 6 SCC 611
122(3-Judge Bench) etc.  Furher, in Masilamani Mudaliar v. Idol of Sri
Swaminathaswami Thirukoil, (1996) 8 SCC 525, …..”
However,  reference  was  nevertheless  made  to  the  Masilamani  Mudaliar
case16, wherein, it was submitted, that this Court had adopted a contrary
position to the Narasu Appa Mali case23 and had held, “But the right to
equality, removing handicaps and discrimination against a Hindu female by
reason of operation of existing law should be in conformity with the right to
equality enshrined in the Constitution and the personal law also needs to
be in conformity with the constitutional goal.” It was also asserted, that this
Court  had  further  held,  “Personal  laws  are  derived  not  from  the
Constitution but from the religious scriptures.  The laws thus derived must
be consistent with the Constitution lest they become void under Article 13 if
they violate fundamental rights.”  It is significant to note, that this case
concerned the inheritance rights of Hindu women.  In view of the aforesaid,
it was submitted, that the observations in the Narasu Appa Mali case23, that
‘personal law’ was not covered under Article 13, was incorrect and not
binding upon this Court.
72.It was also contended, that the Constitution undoubtedly accords
guarantee of faith and belief to every citizen, but every practice of faith
could not be held to be an integral part of religion and belief.  It was
therefore  submitted,  that  every  sustainable  (and  enforceable)  religious
practice,  must  satisfy  the  overarching  constitutional  goal,  of  gender
equality, gender justice and dignity.  It was asserted, that the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, could not be regarded as a part of any “essential religious
practice”, and as such, could not be entitled to the protection of Article 25.
123The  test  of  what  amounts  to  an  essential  religious  practice,  it  was
submitted,  was  laid  down  in  a  catena  of  judgments  including
Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra
Thirtha Swamiar of Shirur Mutt36, wherein this Court held as under:
“20. The contention formulated in such broad terms cannot, we think, be
supported. In the first place, what constitutes the essential part of a
religion is primarily to be ascertained with reference to the doctrines of
that religion  itself.  If the tenets  of any religious  sect of  the Hindus
prescribe that offerings of food should be given to the idol at particular
hours of the day, that periodical ceremonies should be performed in a
certain way at certain periods of the year or that there should be daily
recital of sacred texts or oblations to the sacred fire, all these would be
regarded  as  parts  of  religion  and  the  mere  fact  that  they  involve
expenditure of money or employment of priests and servants or the use
of  marketable  commodities  would  not  make  them  secular  activities
partaking  of  a  commercial  or  economic  character;  all  of  them  are
religious practices and should be regarded as matters of religion within
the meaning of Article 26(b) . What Article 25(2)(a) contemplates is not
regulation by the State of religious practices as such, the freedom of
which is guaranteed by the Constitution except when they run counter to
public order, health and morality but regulation of activities which are
economic, commercial or political in their character though they are
associated with religious practices. We may refer in this connection to a
few  American  and  Australian  cases,  all  of  which  arose  out  of  the
activities of persons connected with the religious association known as
“Jehova's  Witnesses”.  This  association  of  persons  loosely  organised
throughout  Australia,  U.S.A.  and  other  countries  regard  the  literal
interpretation of the Bible as fundamental to proper religious beliefs.
This belief in the supreme authority of the Bible colours many of their
political ideas. They refuse to take oath of allegiance to the king or other
constituted human authority and even to show respect to the national
flag,  and they decry all  wars  between  nations  and  all  kinds  of war
activities. In 1941 a company of “Jehova's Witnesses” incorporated in
Australia  commenced  proclaiming  and  teaching  matters  which  were
prejudicial to war activities and the defence of the Commonwealth and
steps were taken against them under the National Security Regulations
of the State. The legality of the action of the Government was questioned
36
124by means of a writ petition before the High Court and the High Court
held that the action of the Government was justified and that Section
116,  which  guaranteed  freedom  of  religion  under  the  Australian
Constitution, was not in any way infringed by the National Security
Regulations (Vide Adelaide  Company  v. Commonwealth,  67  CLR  116,
127). These were undoubtedly political activities though arising out of
religious belief entertained by a particular community. In such cases, as
Chief Justice Latham pointed out, the provision for protection of religion
was  not  an  absolute  protection  to  be  interpreted  and  applied
independently of other provisions of the Constitution. These privileges
must be reconciled with the right of the State to employ the sovereign
power  to  ensure  peace,  security  and  orderly  living  without  which
constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery .”
Reference was then made to Ratilal v. State of Bombay37, wherein it was
observed as under:
“13. Religious practices or performances of acts in pursuance of religious
belief are as much a part of religion as faith or belief in particular
doctrines. Thus if the tenets of the Jain or the Parsi religion lay down
that certain rites and ceremonies are to be performed at certain times
and in a particular manner, it cannot be said that these are secular
activities partaking of commercial or economic character simply because
they involve expenditure of money or employment of priests or the use of
marketable commodities. No outside authority has any right to say that
these are not essential parts of religion and it is not open to the secular
authority of the State to restrict or prohibit them in any manner they like
under the guise of administering the trust estate . Of course, the scale of
expenses to be incurred in connection with these religious observances
may  be  and  is  a  matter  of  administration  of  property  belonging  to
religious institutions; and if the expenses on these heads are likely to
deplete the endowed properties or affect the stability of the institution,
proper control can certainly be exercised by State agencies as the law
provides. We may refer in this connection to the observation of Davar, J.
in the case of     Jamshed ji     v.     Soonabai     [33 Bom 122] and although they
were made in a case where the question was whether the bequest of
property by a Parsi testator for the purpose of perpetual celebration of
ceremonies like Muktad baj, Vyezashni, etc., which are sanctioned by the
Zoroastrian  religion  were  valid  charitable  gifts,  the  observations,  we
think, are quite appropriate for our present purpose. “If this is the belief
37
125of the community” thus observed the learned Judge, “and it is proved
undoubtedly to be the belief of the Zoroastrian community,—a secular
Judge is bound to accept that belief—it is not for him to sit in judgment
on that belief, he has no right to interfere with the conscience of a donor
who makes a gift in favour of what he believes to be the advancement of
his  religion  and  the  welfare  of  his  community  or  mankind”.  These
observations do, in our opinion, afford an indication of the measure of
protection that is given by Article 26(b) of our Constitution .”
Our attention was also drawn to Qureshi v. State of Bihar38, wherein this
Court held as under:
“13. Coming now to the arguments as to the violation of the petitioners'
fundamental rights, it will be convenient to take up first the complaint
founded on Article 25(1). That article runs as follows:
“Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions
of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and
the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.”
After referring to the provisions of clause (2) which lays down certain
exceptions which are not material for our present purpose this Court
has, in Ratilal Panachand Gandhi  v. The State of Bombay  [(1954) SCR
1055, 1062-1063] explained the meaning and scope of this article thus:
“Thus,  subject  to  the  restrictions  which  this  article  imposes,  every
person has a fundamental   right under our Constitution not merely to
entertain such religious belief as may be approved of by his judgment or
conscience  but  to  exhibit  his  belief  and  section  also  violates  the
fundamental rights of the petitioners ideas in such overt acts as are
enjoined  or  sanctioned  by  his  religion  and  further  to  propagate  his
religious views for the edification of others. It is immaterial also whether
the propagation is made by a person in his individual capacity or on
behalf of any church or institution. The free exercise of religion by which
is meant the performance of outward acts in pursuance of religious
belief, is, as stated above, subject to State regulation imposed to secure
order, public health and morals of the people .”
What then, we inquire, are the materials placed before us to substantiate
the claim that the sacrifice of a cow is enjoined or sanctioned by Islam?
The materials before us are extremely meagre and it is surprising that on
a matter of this description the allegations in the petition should be so
vague. In the Bihar Petition No. 58 of 1956 are set out the following bald
allegations:
“That the petitioners further respectfully submit that the said impugned
guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution in-as-much as on the
38
126occasion  of  their  Bakr  Id  Day,  it  is  the  religious  practice  of  the
petitioners' community to sacrifice a cow on the said occasion. The poor
members  of  the  community  usually  sacrifice  one  cow  for  every  7
members  whereas  it  would  require  one  sheep  or  one  goat  for  each
member which would entail considerably more expense. As a result of
the total ban imposed by the impugned section the petitioners would not
even be  allowed to  make  the  said sacrifice  which is a practice and
custom in their religion, enjoined upon them by the Holy Quran, and
practised by all Muslims from time immemorial and recognised as such
in India.”
The allegations in the other petitions are similar. These are met by an
equally bald denial in paragraph 21 of the affidavit in opposition.  No
affidavit has been filed by any person specially competent to expound the
relevant tenets of Islam. No reference is made in the petition to any
particular  Surah  of  the  Holy  Quran  which,  in  terms,  requires  the
sacrifice of a cow. All that was placed before us during the argument
were Surah XXII, Verses 28 and 33, and Surah CVIII. What the Holy
book  enjoins  is  that  people  should  pray  unto  the  Lord  and  make
sacrifice. We have no affidavit before us by any Maulana explaining the
implications of those verses or throwing any light on this problem. We,
however, find it laid down in Hamilton's translation of Hedaya Book XLIII
at p. 592 that it is the duty of every free Mussulman, arrived at the age
of maturity,  to offer a sacrifice on the Yd Kirban, or festival of the
sacrifice, provided he be then possessed of Nisab and be not a traveller.
The sacrifice established for one person is a goat and that for seven a
cow or a camel. It is therefore, optional for a Muslim to sacrifice a goat
for one person or a cow or a camel for seven persons. It does not appear
to be obligatory that a person must sacrifice a cow . The very fact of an
option seems to run counter to the notion of an obligatory duty. It is,
however, pointed out that a person with six other members of his family
may afford to sacrifice a cow but may not be able to afford to sacrifice
seven goats. So there may be an economic compulsion although there is
no religious compulsion. It is also pointed out that from time immemorial
the Indian Mussalmans have been sacrificing cows and this practice, if
not enjoined, is certainly sanctioned by their religion and it amounts to
their practice of religion protected by Article 25. While the petitioners
claim  that  the  sacrifice  of  a  cow  is  essential,  the  State  denies  the
obligatory nature of the religious practice. The fact, emphasised by the
respondents, cannot be disputed, namely, that many Mussalmans do not
sacrifice a cow on the Bakr Id Day. It is part of the known history of
India that the Moghul Emperor Babar saw the wisdom of prohibiting the
slaughter of cows as and by way of religious sacrifice and directed his
son  Humayun  to  follow  this  example.  Similarly  Emperors  Akbar,
Jehangir, and Ahmad Shah, it is said, prohibited cow slaughter. Nawab
Hyder Ali of Mysore made cow slaughter an offence punishable with the
cutting of  the hands  of  the offenders.  Three of the  members of the
Gosamvardhan  Enquiry  Committee  set  up  by  the  Uttar  Pradesh
Government in 1953 were Muslims and concurred in the unanimous
127recommendation for total ban on slaughter of cows. We have, however,
no material on the record before us which will enable us to say, in the
face of the foregoing facts, that the sacrifice of a cow on that day is an
obligatory overt act for a Mussalman to exhibit his religious belief and
idea. In the premises, it is not possible for us to uphold this claim of the
petitioners.”
Learned Attorney General also cited, State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti
Kureshi Kassab Jamat39, and placed reliance on the following observations:
“22. In State of W.B. v. Ashutosh Lahiri  [(1995) 1 SCC 189] this Court
has  noted  that sacrifice  of any animal  by Muslims  for  the religious
purpose on BakrI'd does not include slaughtering of cows as the only
way of carrying out that sacrifice.  Slaughtering of cows on     BakrI'd     is
neither essential  to nor necessarily required as part of the religious
ceremony. An optional religious practice is not covered by Article 25(1) .
On the contrary, it is common knowledge that the cow and its progeny
i.e. bull, bullocks and calves are worshipped by Hindus on specified days
during Diwali and other festivals like  Makar Sankranti  and Gopashtmi. A
good number of temples are to be found where the statue of “ Nandi” or
“Bull” is regularly worshipped. However, we do not propose to delve
further into the question as we must state, in all fairness to the learned
counsel for the parties, that no one has tried to build any argument
either in defence or in opposition to the judgment appealed against by
placing reliance on religion or Article 25 of the Constitution.”
Finally, our attention was invited to Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb
v. State of Bombay40, wherein it was observed as under:
“60. But very different considerations arise when one has to deal with
legislation which is claimed to be merely a measure “providing for social
welfare and reform”. To start with, it has to be admitted that this phrase
is, as contrasted with the second portion of Article 25(2)( b), far from
precise and is flexible in its content. In this connection it has to be borne
in mind that limitations imposed on religious practices on the ground of
public order, morality or health have already been saved by the opening
words of Article 25(1) and the saving would cover beliefs and practices
even though considered essential or vital by those professing the religion.
I consider that in the context in which the phrase occurs, it is intended
to save the validity only of those laws which do not invade the basic and
essential practices of religion which are guaranteed by the operative
portion of Article 25(1) for two reasons : (  1  ) To read the saving as covering
39
40
128even the basic essential practices of religion, would in effect nullify and
render  meaningless  the  entire  guarantee  of  religious  freedom  —  a
freedom not merely to profess, but to practice religion, for very few pieces
of legislation for abrogating religious practices could fail to be subsumed
under the caption of “a provision for social welfare or reform” . (2) If the
phrase  just quoted  was  intended  to  have  such  a wide  operation  as
cutting at even the essentials guaranteed by Article 25(1), there would
have been no need for the special provision as to “throwing open of
Hindu religious institutions” to all classes and sections of Hindus since
the legislation contemplated by this provision would be par excellence
one of social reform.”
73.It was pointed out, that in the counter-affidavit dated August 2016,
filed on behalf of the Muslim Personal Law Board, i.e., respondent no.3 to
this petition, the practices of triple talaq (as well as, ‘nikah halala’ and
polygamy)  have  been  referred  to  as  “undesirable”.   It  was  accordingly
submitted, that no “undesirable” practice can be conferred the status of an
“essential  practice”,  much  less  one  that  forms  the  substratum  of  the
concerned religion.  
74.It was asserted on behalf of the Union of India, that the Indian State
was  obligated  to  adhere  to  the  principles  enshrined  in  international
covenants, to which it is a party.  India being a founding member of the
United Nations, is bound by its Charter, which embodies the first ever
international agreement to proclaiming gender equality, as a human right in
its preamble, and reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights, through
the dignity of the human person, by guaranteeing equal rights to men and
women. It was submitted, that significantly, the United Nations Commission
on the Status of Women, first met in February, 1947, with 15 member
States – all represented by women, including India (represented through
Shareefah  Hamid  Ali).  During  its  very  first  session,  the  Commission
129declared its guiding principles, including the pledge to raise the status of
women, irrespective of nationality, race, language or religion, to the same
level  as  men,  in  all  fields  of  human  enterprise,  and  to  eliminate  all
discrimination against women in the provisions of statutory law, in legal
maxims or rules, or in interpretation of customary law. (United Nations
Commission on the Status of Women, First Session, E/281/Rev.1, February
25, 1947).  It was submitted, that the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, 1948, the International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, 1966 and the International Covenant of Social and Political Rights,
1966, emphasized on equality between men and women.  The other relevant
international instruments on women which were brought to our notice,
included  the  Convention  on  the  Political  Rights  of  Women  (1952),
Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and
Armed  Conflict  (1974),  Inter-American  Convention  for  the  Prevention,
Punishment and Elimination of Violence against Women (1955), Universal
Declaration  on  Democracy  (1997),  and  the  Optional  Protocol  to  the
Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  against
Women (1999).  It was submitted by the learned Attorney General, that the
Government of India ratified the Vienna Declaration and the Convention on
the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on
19-6-1993.  The preamble of CEDAW reiterates, that discrimination against
women violated the principles of equality of rights and respect for human
dignity.  And that, such inequality was an obstacle to the participation on
equal terms with men in the political, social, economic and cultural life of
130their country.  It was emphasized that such inequality, also hampered the
growth of the personality from society and family, and made it more difficult
for the full development of potentialities of women, in the service of their
countries and of humanity.  Article 1 of the CEDAW, it was pointed out,
defines discrimination against women, while Article 2(b) enjoins the State
parties to pursue elimination of discrimination against women, by adopting
“appropriate  legislative  and  other  measures  including  sanctions  where
appropriate, prohibiting all discriminations against women”.  Clause (c) of
Article 2 enjoins the ratifying States, to ensure legal protection of the rights
of  women,  and  Article  3  of the  CEDAW  enjoins  the  States  to  take  all
appropriate  measures  to  ensure  full  development  and  advancement  of
women,  for  the  purpose  of  guaranteeing  to  them,  the  exercise  and
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on the basis of
equality with men.  It was further submitted on behalf of the Union of India,
that the equality principles were reaffirmed in the Second World Conference
on Human Rights, held at Vienna in June 1993, as also, in the Fourth
World Conference on Women, held at Beijing in 1995.  It was pointed out,
that India was a party to this convention and other declarations, and was
committed to actualize them.  It was asserted, that in the 1993 Conference,
gender-based  violence  and  all  categories  of  sexual  harassment  and
exploitation, were condemned.
75.Last  of  all,  the  Attorney  General  pointed  out,  the  prevailing
international trend all around the world, wherein the practice of divorce
through ‘talaq-e-biddat’, has been statutorily done away with (-for details,
131refer to Part-5 – Abrogation of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by legislation,
the world over, in Islamic, as well as, non-Islamic States).  On the basis of
the submissions noticed above, it was contended, that it was extremely
significant to note, that a large number of Muslim countries, or countries
with  a  large  Muslim  populations  such  as,  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,
Afghanistan,  Morocco,  Tunisia,  Turkey,  Indonesia,  Egypt,  Iran  and  Sri
Lanka had undertaken significant reforms and had regulated divorce law.
It was pointed out, that legislation in Pakistan requires a man to obtain the
permission  of  an  Arbitration  Council.   Practices  in  Bangladesh,  it  was
pointed out, were similar to those in Pakistan.  Tunisia and Turkey, it was
submitted, also do not recognize extra-judicial divorce, of the nature of
‘talaq-e-biddat’. In Afghanistan, divorce where three pronouncements are
made in one sitting, is considered to be invalid.  In Morocco and Indonesia,
divorce proceedings take place in a secular court, procedures of mediation
and reconciliation are encouraged, and men and women are considered
equal in matters of family and divorce.  In Indonesia, divorce is a judicial
process,  where  those  marrying  under  Islamic  Law,  can  approach  the
Religious Court for a divorce, while others can approach District Courts for
the same.  In Iran and Sri Lanka, divorce can be granted by a Qazi and/or a
court, only after reconciliation efforts have failed.  It was submitted, that
even Islamic theocratic States, have undergone reform in this area of the
law, and therefore, in a secular republic like India, there is no reason to
deny women, the rights available all across the Muslim world.  The fact that
Muslim countries have undergone extensive reform, it was submitted, also
132establishes  that  the  practice  in  question  is  not  an  essential  religious
practice.
76.In the circumstance aforesaid, it was submitted, that the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ cannot be protected under Article 25(1) of the Constitution.
Furthermore, since Article 25(1) is subject to Part III of the Constitution, as
such, it was liable to be in consonance with, and not violative of the rights
conferred through Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.  Since the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ clearly violates the fundamental rights expressed
in  the  above  Articles,  it  was  submitted,  that  it  be  declared  as
unconstitutional.
77.It is also necessary for us to recount an interesting incident that
occurred  during  the  course  of  hearing.   The  learned  Attorney  General
having assisted this Court in the manner recounted above, was emphatic
that the other procedures available to Muslim men for obtaining divorce,
such as, ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ were also liable to be declared
as unconstitutional, for the same reasons as have been expressed with
reference to ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  In this behalf, the contention advanced was,
that just as ‘talaq-e-biddat’, ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ were based
on the unilateral will of the husband, neither of these forms of divorce
required the availability of a reasonable cause with the husband to divorce
his wife, and neither of these needed the knowledge and/or notice of the
wife, and in neither of these procedures the knowledge and/or consent of
the wife was required.  And as such, the other two so-called approved
procedures  of  divorce  (‘talaq-e-ahsan’  and  ‘talaq-e-hasan’)  available  to
133Muslim men, it was submitted, were equally arbitrary and unreasonable, as
the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was pointed out, that submissions during
the course of hearing were confined by the Union of India, to the validity of
‘talaq-e-biddat’  merely  because  this  Court,  at  the  commencement  of
hearing, had informed the parties, that the present hearing would be limited
to  the  examination  of  the  prayer  made  by  the  petitioners  and  the
interveners on the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was contended, that the
challenge to ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ would follow immediately
after  this  Court  had  rendered  its  pronouncement  with  reference  to
‘talaq-e-biddat’.   We  have  referred  to  the  incident,  and  considered  the
necessity to record it, because of the response of the learned Attorney
General to a query raised by the Bench.  One of us (U.U. Lalit, J.), enquired
from the learned Attorney General, that if all the three procedures referred
to above, as were available to Muslim men to divorce their wives, were set
aside as unconstitutional, Muslim men would be rendered remediless in
matters of divorce?  The learned Attorney General answered the querry in
the affirmative.   But assured the Court,  that the Parliament would enact a
legislation within no time, laying down grounds on which Muslim men
could divorce their wives.  We have accordingly recorded the above episode,
because it has relevance to the outcome of the present matter.
78.Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General of India,
endorsed all the submissions and arguments, advanced by the learned
Attorney General.  On each aspect of the matter, the learned Additional
134Solicitor General, independently supported the legal propositions canvassed
on behalf of the Union of India.
Part-8.
The rebuttal of the petitioners’ contentions:
79.The submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, were first of
all sought to be repudiated by the AIMPLB – respondent no.8 (hereinafter
referred to as the AIMPLB).  Mr. Kapil Sibal, Senior Advocate, and a number
of other learned counsel represented the AIMPLB. In order to lay down the
foundation to the submissions sought to be canvassed on behalf of the
respondents, it was asserted, that ceremonies performed at the time of birth
of an individual, are in consonance with the religious norms of the family to
which the child is born. And thereafter, in continuation each stage of life
during the entire progression of life, is punctuated by ceremonies. It was
pointed out, that even the act of adoption of a child, in some other family,
has religious ceremonies. In the absence of such religious rituals, adoption
is  not  valid.  It  was  submitted,  that  religious  observances  manifest  an
important  fundamental  position,  in  the  life  of  every  individual.   Such
religious observances, according to learned counsel, include the manner in
which members of a community were required to dress.  Insofar as the
Muslim women are concerned, reference was made to ‘burqa’ or ‘hijab’ worn
by women, whereby women veil themselves, from the gaze of strangers.  All
these observances, are matters of faith, of those professing the religion. It
was asserted, that those who profess the Muslim religion, follow the edicts
expressed in the Quran.  It was submitted, that matrimony, is like any
135other stage in an individual’s life.  It  has to be performed, in consonance
with the ceremonies relating thereto.  So also, if a married couple decides to
part ways, by way of divorce.  It was pointed out, that express religious
ceremonies are observed even on an individual’s death.  It was submitted,
that  all  issues  including  custody  and  guardianship  of  children,
maintenance, dower, gifts and such like issues, were matters guided by the
faith of the people, associated to their religion.  How property has to be
distributed, upon divorce and/or at the time of death, is also governed by
faith. It was submitted, that questions of inheritance and succession, were
likewise dealt with in consonance with the edicts of the individual’s religion.
All these issues, it was submitted, were matters of religious faith.
80.It was  pointed  out,  that  the  personal  affairs  referred  to  in  the
foregoing paragraph, fall in the realm of ‘personal law’.  This assertion, was
sought to be demonstrated, by placing reliance on the definition of the term
‘personal law’ in Blacks Law Dictionary (10th edition, 2014), as follows:
“The law that governs a person’s family matters, regardless of where the
person goes.  In common law systems, personal law refers to the law of
the person’s domicile.  In civil-law systems, it refers to the law of the
individual’s nationality (and so is sometimes called lex patriae).”
Reference was also made to the definition of the term ‘personal law’ in
‘Conflict of Laws 188’ (7th edition, 1974) by R.H. Graveson, who defined the
term as under:
“The idea of the personal law is based on the conception of man as a
social being, so that those transactions of his daily life which affect him
most closely in a personal sense, such as marriage, divorce, legitimacy,
many kinds of capacity, and succession, may be governed universally by
that system of law deemed most suitable and adequate for the purpose
…”
136Based  on  the  cumulative  definition  of  the  term  ‘personal  law’,  it  was
submitted, that the evolution of the matters of faith relating to religious
practices, must necessarily be judged in the context of practices adopted by
the  concerned  community,  with  reference  to  each  individual  aspect  of
‘personal law’.  It was conceded, on behalf of the AIMPLB, that ‘personal
laws’ were  per se subservient to legislation, and as such, ‘personal laws’
were liable to be considered as mandatory, with reference to numerous
aspects of an individual’s life, only in the absence of legislation.
81.Even  though  it  was  acknowledged,  that  legislation  on  an  issue
would override ‘personal law’ on the matter, it was pointed out, that in the
absence of legislation ‘personal laws’ in the Indian context, could not be
assailed on the basis of their being in conflict with any of the provisions
contained in Part III of the Constitution – the Fundamental Rights.  It was
submitted, that in the absence of statutory law, religious practices and
faith,  constituted  the  individual’s  (belonging  to  a  community)  right  to
profess the same.  In order to substantiate his contention, that a challenge
to ‘personal law’ could not be raised on the anvil of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of
the Constitution, learned senior counsel, placed reliance on the Narasu
Appa Mali case23. Learned  senior counsel, also  placed  reliance  on  Shri
Krishna  Singh  v.  Mathura  Ahir41,  wherein  this  Court  arrived  at  the
conclusion, that the rights of ‘sudras’ (the lowest amongst the four Hindu
castes – members of the workers caste), as were expressed by the Smriti
(-refers to a body of Hindu texts, traditionally recorded in writing) writers,
41
137were invalid because they were in conflict with the fundamental rights
guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.  It was submitted, that both
the above  judgments were considered by this Court in Ahmedabad Women
Action Group v. Union of India42, wherein, the legal position recorded in the
above judgments was confirmed.  It was pointed out, that there was a clear
distinction between ‘law’ and ‘law in force’, thus far interpreted by this
Court with reference to Article 13 of the Constitution.  It was asserted, that
read along with Article 372 – which mandates, that all laws in force in the
territory  of  India,  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  the
Constitution, would continue to remain in force, until altered, repealed or
amended by a competent legislature or other competent authority. It was
submitted, that to affect a change in ‘personal law’, it was imperative to
embark on legislation, as provided for through entry 5 of the Concurrent
List in  the  Seventh  Schedule,  which  provides  –  “marriage  and  divorce;
infants and minors; adoption; wills, intestacy and succession; joint family
and partition; all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings
were immediately before the commencement of this Constitution subject to
their personal law. ”  It was therefore urged, that ‘personal laws’ per se were
not subject to challenge, under any of the provisions contained in Part III of
the Constitution.  
82.It was contended, that the expression ‘custom and usage’ in Article
13 of the Constitution, would not include faith of religious denominations,
embedded in their ‘personal law’.  Insofar as the instant aspect of the
42
138matter  is  concerned,  reference  was  also  made  to  Section  112  of  the
Government of India Act, 1915, wherein a clear distinction was sought to be
drawn between ‘personal laws’ and ‘customs having force of law’.  Section
112, aforementioned is extracted hereunder:
“112. Law to be administered in cases of inheritance and succession. –
The high courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, in the exercise of their
original jurisdiction in suits against inhabitants of Calcutta, Madras or
Bombay,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall,  in  maters  of  inheritance  and
succession to lands, rents and goods, and in matters of contract and
dealing between party and party, when both parties are subject to the
same personal law or custom having the force of law, decide according to
that  personal  law  or  custom,  and  when  the  parties  are  subject  to
different  personal  laws  or  customs  having  the  force  of  law,  decide
according to the law or custom to which the defendant is subject .”
It was pointed out, that in framing Article 13, the choice of the words
“custom and usage” and the exclusion of the expression “personal law”
needed to be taken due note of.  It was submitted, that the Constituent
Assembly  was  aware  of  the  use  of  the  term  ‘personal  law’  (-which  it
consciously used in entry 5 of the Concurrent List, in the Seventh Schedule)
and  the  term  ‘customs  and  usages’,  which  the  Constituent  Assembly,
employed while framing Article 13 of the Constitution.  It was pointed out,
that the above position was consciously highlighted by a Full Bench of the
Andhra Pradesh High Court in the Youth Welfare Federation case43.  It was
submitted, that if the term ‘personal law’ was excluded from the definition
‘law in force’ deployed in Article 13, then matters of faith having a direct
relationship to some religious denomination (matters of ‘personal law’), do
not have to satisfy the rights enumerated in Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the
Constitution.  In the above view of the matter, it was contended, that the
43
139challenge raised on behalf of the petitioners on the basis of the provisions
contained  in  Part  III  –  Fundamental  Rights,  needed  to  be  summarily
rejected
83.Having  presented  the  aforesaid  overview  of  the  constitutional
position Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel, endeavoured to deal with
the concept of ‘talaq’ in ‘Shariat’ – Muslim ‘personal law’.  Learned senior
counsel pointed out, that religious denominations in India with reference to
Islam were divided into two categories – the Sunnis, and the Shias.  It was
pointed  out,  that  Sunnis  were  again  sub-divided  into  religious
denominations/schools.  The four prominent Sunni schools being – Hanafi,
Malaki,  Shafei  and  Hanbali.  It  was  submitted,  that  a  fifth
school/denomination had emerged later – Ahl-e-Hadith.   It was pointed out,
that in India 90% of the Muslims amongst the Sunnis, belonged to the
Hanafi school.  It was submitted, that Shia and the other denominations of
the Sunnis comprised a very small population of Muslims in India.
84.Learned  counsel  emphasized,  that  the  three  forms  of  talaq  –
‘talaq-e-ahsan’,  ‘talaq-e-hasan’  and  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  referred  to  by  the
petitioners,  during  the  course  of  hearing,  were  merely  depicting  the
procedure which a Muslim husband was required to follow, to divorce his
wife.  It was pointed out, that none of these procedural forms, finds a
reference  in  the  Quran.   It was  asserted,  that none  of  these  forms  is
depicted even in the ‘hadith’.  It was acknowledged, that ‘hadiths’ declared
talaq by itself, as not a good practice, and yet – recognized the factum of
talaq, and its legal sanctity.  It was submitted, that talaq was accepted by
140all believers of Islam.  It was therefore contended, that it was absurd for the
petitioners to have submitted that the Quran alone, provided the details
with  reference  to  which,  and  in  the  manner  in  which,  talaq  could  be
administered.  It was therefore asserted, that a close examination of the
challenge raised by the petitioners would reveal that talaq as a concept itself
was not under challenge at the hands of the petitioners.  It was pointed out,
that truthfully the petitioners were merely assailing the course adopted by
Muslim men, in divorcing their wives through the ‘talaq-e-biddat’ procedure.
85.Learned counsel acknowledged the position adopted on behalf of the
petitioners, namely, that Islam represents (i) what is provided for in the
Quran, (ii) what was stated and practiced by the Prophet Muhammad from
time to time, and (iii) what was memorized and recorded in the ‘hadiths’
which through centuries of generations, Muslim belief represents what the
Prophet  Muhamad  had  said  and  practiced.   It  was  asserted,  that  the
afore-stated parameters represent Islamic law being practiced by Mulsims
over centuries, which had become part of the religious faith of various
Muslim  denominations/schools.   This  ambit  of  recognized  practices,
according to learned counsel, falls within the sphere of  Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’.
86.Learned senior counsel then attempted to highlight various verses
from the Quran, to substantiate his contention.  The same are set out
hereunder:
“i. Whatever ‘Allah has passed on to His Messenger from the people of
the towns is for Allah and for the Messenger, and for the kinsmen and
the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, so that it may not circulate
only between the rich among you.  And whatever the Messenger gives
141you, take it, and whatever he forbids you from, abstain (from it).  And
fear  Allah.  Indeed  Allah  is  severe  in  punishment.  (Quran,  Al-Hashr
59:71)
ii. O you who believe, obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not turn
away from Him whn you listen (to him).  (Quran, Al-Anfal 8:20)
iii. We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by the leave of Allah.
Had they, after having wronged themselves, come to you and sought
forgiveness  from  Allah,  and  had  the  Messenger  prayed  for  their
forgiveness,  they  would  certainly  have  found  Allah  Most-Relenting,
Very-Merciful (Quran, Al-Nisa 4:64)
iv. That is because they were hostile to Allah and His Messenger; and
whoever becomes hostile to Allah and His Messenger, then, Allah is
severe at punishment. (Quran, Al-Anfal 8:13)
v. It is not open for a believing man or a believing woman, once Allah and
His messenger have decided a thing, that they should have a choice
about their mattr; and whoever disobeys Allah and His messenger, he
indeed gets off the track, falling into an open error. (Quran, Al-Ahzab
33:36)
vi. Whoever breaks away with the Messenger after the right path has
become clear to him, and follows what is not the way of the believers, we
shall let him have what he chose, and We shall admit him to Jahannam,
which is an evil place to return. (Quran, Al-Nisa 4:115)”
In addition to the above, reference was also made to the Quran with respect
to triple talaq. The same are set out hereunder:
“i. Divorce is twice; then either to retain in all fairness, or to release
nicely.  It is not lawful for you to take back anything from what you have
given  them,  unless  both  apprehend  that  they  would  not  be  able  to
maintain the limits set by Allah.  Now, if you apprehend that they would
not maintain the limits set by Allah, then, there is no sin or them in
what she gives up to secure her release.  These are the limits set by
Allah.  Therefore, do not exceed them.  Whosoever exceeds the limits set
by Allah, then, those are the transgressors. (Quran, Al-Baqarah 2:229)
ii. Thereafter, if he divorces her, she shall no longer remain lawful for
him unless she marries a man other than him.  Should he too divorce
her, then there is no sin on them in their returning to each other, if they
think they would maintain the limits set by Allah.  These are the limits
set by Allah that He makes clear to a people who know (that Allah is
alone capable of setting these limits.  (Quran, Al-Baqarah 2:229 and 230)
iii. When you have divorced women, and they have reached (the end of)
their waiting period, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands
when they mutually agree with fairness.  Thus, the advice is given to
everyone of you who believes in Allah and in the Hereafter.  This is more
pure and clean for you.  Allah knows and you do not know. (Quran,
Al-Baqarah, 2:232)
142iv. O Prophet, when you people divorce women, divorce them at a time
when the period of Iddah may start.  And count the period of Iddah, and
fear Allah, your Lord.  Do not expel them from their houses, nor should
they go out, unless they come up with a clearly shameless act.  These are
the  limits  prescribed  by  Allah.   And  whoever  exceeds  the  limits
prescribed by Allah wrongs his own self.  You do not know (what will
happen in future); it may be that Allah brings about a new situation
thereafter. (Quran, Al-Talaq, 65:1)”
In order to demonstrate the complete picture, learned senior counsel invited
the Court’s attention to the statements attributed to the Prophet Mo hamad
with reference to talaq which, according to learned counsel, would have a
bearing on the determination of the controversy in hand.  The same are
extracted as under:
“i. Salmah bid Abi Salmah narrated to his father that when Hafs bin
Mughaira resorted to Triple Talaq, the Prophet (Pbuh) held it as valid. All
the three pronouncements were made with  a single word so the Prophet
(Pubh) separated her from him irrevocably.  And it didn’t reach to us that
the Prophet (Pubh) rebuked him for that (Daraqutni, Kitab Al-Talaq wa
Al-Khula wa Al-Aiyla,5/23, Hadith number:3992)
ii. Amas recpimts pm Muadh’s authority: “I heard the Prophet (Pbuh)
sying : O Muadh, whoever resorts to bidaa divorce, be it one, two or
three.   We  will  make  his  divorce  effective.  (Daraqutni,  5/81.  Kitab
al-Talaq wa Al-Khulawa aI-Aiyala, Hadith number: 4020)
iii. (When Abdullah Ibn Umar divorced his wife once while she was
having menses.  The Prophet (Pbuh) asked him to retain his wife saying,
O Ibn e Umar, Allah Tabarak wa taala didn’t command like this: “You
acted against Sunnah.  And sunnah is that you wait for Tuhar then
divorce at every purity period.  He said so Prophet (Pbuh) Ordered me so
I retained her.  Then he said to me: When she becomes pure divorce at
that time or keep (her) So Abdullah ibn Umar asked: “Had I resorted to
Triple Talaq then, could I retain her?”  The Prophet (Pbuh) replied: “No,
she would be separated from you and such an ction oyour part would
have been a sin” (Sunan Bayhaqi, 7/547, Hadith number: 14955).
iv. Aishah Khathmiya was Hasan bin Ali’s wife.  When Ali was killed and
Hasan bin Ali was made caliph.  Hasan bin Ali visited her and she
congratulated him for the caliphate.  Hasan bin Ali replied, “you have
expressed happiness over the killing of Ali.  So you are divorced thrice”.
She covered herself with her cloth and said, “By Allah I did not mean
this”.  She stayed until her iddat lapsed and she departed.  Hasan bin Ali
sent her the remaining dower and a gift of twenty thousand dirhams.
When the messenger reached her and she saw the money she said “this
is a very small gift from the beloved from whom I have been separated”.
143When the messenger informed Hasan bin Ali about this he broke into
tears  saying,  “Had  I  not  heard  from  my  father  reporting  from  my
grandfather that the Prophet (Pbuh) said that whoever pronounced triple
talaaq upon his wife, she will not be permitted to him till the time she
marries  a  husband  other  than  he,  I  would  have  taken  her  back.
(AI-Sunan AI-Kubra Iil Bayhaqi, Hadith number: 14492)
v. Uwaymar Ajlani complained to the Prophet (Pbuh) that he had seen
his wife committing adultery.  His wife denied this charge.  In line with
the Quranic command, the Prophet (Pbuh) initiated “a proceeding for the
couple.  Upon the completion of the process, Uwaymar said: “If I retain
her, I Will be taken as a liar”.  So in the Prophet’s presence, and without
the Prophet’s command, he pronounced Triple Talaq. (Sahi al-Bukhari
Kitab al-Talaq, Hadith number: 5259)”
87.Having dealt with the verses from the Quran and the statements
attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, learned senior counsel invited the
Court’s attention to ‘hadiths’, in relation to talaq.  The same are extracted
below:
“(i) Of all the things permitted by Allah, divorce is the most undesirable
act. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Bad Karahiya al-Talaq, Hadith no: 2178).
(ii) If a person who had pronounced Triple Talaq in one go was brought to
Caliph  Umar  he  would  put  him  to  pain  by  beating  and  thereafter
separate the couple. (Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah, Bab man kara an
yatliq aI rajal imratahuu thalatha fi maqad wahadi wa ajaza dhalika
alayhi.  Hadith number: 18089.
(iii) Alqama narrated from Abdullah that he was asked about a person
who pronounced hundred divorces to his wife.  He said three made her
prohibited (to him) and ninety seven is transgression (Musannaf ibn Abi
Shayba, Kitab al-Talaq, bab fi al rajal yatlaqu imratahuu miata aw alfa.
Hadith number: 18098)
(iv) A man met another playful man in Medinah.  He saidk, “Did you
divorce your wife?  He said, “Yes”.  He said, “How many thousand? (How
many? He replied: thousand).  So he was presented before Umar.  He
said so you have divorced your wife?  He said I was playing.  So he
mounted upon him with the whip and said out of these three will suffice
you.  Another narrator reports Umar saying: “Triple Talaq will suffice
you” (Musannaf Abd al-Razzaq, Kitab al-talaq, Hadith number 11340). 
(v) Abdullah Ibn Umar said: “Whoever resorts to Triple Talaq, he disobeys
his Lord and wife is alienated from him.” (Musannaf ibn Abi Shayba,
Kitab aI-Talaq, Hadith no: 18091).
(vi) Imran Ibn Hussain was asked about a person who divorced his wife
by Triple Talaq in single session.  He said that the person had disobeyed
his Lord and his wife had become prohibited to him.  (Musannaf Ibn Abi
Shayba, Hadith no: 18087)
144(vii) If one tells his wife with whom he did not have conjugal relations:
Triple Talaq be upon you it will be effective.  For he divorced her while
she was his wife.  Same holds true for his wife with whom his marriage
was consummated.” (Al-Muhadhdhab, 4/305)
(viii) Chapter heading runs thus:  “The sance of those who take the
Quranic  statement:  ‘Divorce  can  be  pronounced  twice,  then  either
honourable retention or kind release; to mean that Triple Talaq becomes
effective. (Bukhari, 3/402)”
88.Based  on  the  factual  position  recorded  in  the  previous  three
paragraphs,  it  was  submitted,  that  this  Court  should  not  attempt  to
interpret the manner in which the believers of the faith had understood the
process for pronouncement of talaq.  It was pointed out, that matters of
faith should best be left to be interpreted by the community itself, in the
manner  in  which  its  members  understand  their  own  religion.   This,
according  to  learned  counsel,  was  imperative  in  view  of  the  absolute
contradictions  which  clearly  emerge  from  a  collective  perusal  of  the
submissions advanced on behalf the petitioners, as also, those canvassed
on behalf of the respondents.  It was submitted, that different scholars have
applied  different  interpretations.   It  was  also  pointed  out,  that  the
interpretations  relied upon on  behalf of the  petitioners,  were mostly of
scholars  who  did  not  belong  to  the  Sunni  faith,  and  were  therefore
irrelevant, for the determination of the interpretation of the believers and
followers of the Hanafi school of Sunni Muslims.  One of the scholars relied
upon, according to learned senior counsel, was a disciple of Mirza Ghulam
Ahmed (the founder of the Quadini school), who declared himself to be the
Prophet, after the demise of the Prophet Muhammad.  It was pointed out,
that Quadini’s disciple was Mohammed Ali.  And, the interpretations relied
upon  by  different  High  Courts  (-for  reference,  see    Part-6  –  Judicial
145pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’),  in  recording  their
conclusions, were based on views attributed to Mohammed Ali.  It was
submitted, that Mohammed Ali is not recognized by all Muslims, and as
such, it would be a travesty of justice if his utterances were to be relied
upon and followed, contrary to the faith of Muslims (–especially Muslims
belonging  to  Hanafi  school).   Having  expressed  the  aforesaid  overview,
learned senior counsel highlighted from individual judgments of the High
Courts (-for details, refer to Part-6 –  Judicial  pronouncements, on the
subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’)  and pointed out, that the reliances on various
‘hadiths’ recorded therein were not appropriate in the background projected
above.
89.Having  made  the  above  submissions,  learned  senior  counsel
attempted to pointedly approach the subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.
In  this  behalf  it  was  reiterated,  that  talaq  was  in  three  forms  –
‘talaq-e-ahsan’, ‘talaq-e-hasan’ and ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was pointed out, that
none of these forms of talaq are referred to either in the Quran, or the
‘hadith’.  It was submitted, that the aforesaid three forms of talaq, have
been so categorized by Islamic scholars.  It was pointed out, that what was
common in all the forms of talaq, was the finality thereof, in the matter of
severance of the matrimonial tie between the husband and wife.  Another
commonness  was  also  pointed  out,  namely,  that  ‘talaq-e-ahsan’,  if  not
revoked,  attain  finality;  that  ‘talaq-e-hasan’  if  likewise  not  revoked,  is
treated as final; and that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq at the time of its
pronouncement,  is  considered  as  final.   It  was  submitted,  that  all
146kinds/forms of talaq when administered three times became irrevocable.
Yet again, it was reiterated, that the petitioners before this Court were not
challenging the finality of talaq, they were merely challenging the procedure
adopted  by  the  Muslim  husbands  while  administering  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
which has the immediate consequences of finality.
90.In the context expressed in the preceding paragraph, it was sought
to be highlighted, that Imam Abu Hanifa did not himself record his own
understanding what the Prophet Muhammad  had said. It was pointed out,
that he  had  two  disciples  –  Abu  Yusuf  and  Imam  Mohammed.  It was
submitted, that Imam Abu Yusuf in his book “Ikhtilaaf Abi Hanifah wabni
Abi Laila” (first edition, 1357) stated the following on the triple talaq:
“i. If the man said to his wife, “Your matter is in your hand:, she said, “I
have divorced myself three times”.  Abu Haneefah (may Allah be pleased
with him) says: “If the husband intends three times, then it is three.”
Reference was also made to the writings of Imam Abu Mohammed in his
book entitled “Al-Mautta” (first volume), wherein he asserted as under:
“i. Muhammad says: So we follow this that if she chooses her husband
then it will not be counted a divorce, and if she chooses herself then it is
accorfding to what her husband intended, if his intention is one hen it
will be counted one irrevocable (Baainah) divorce, and if his is three it
will be three divorces.  This is the saying of Abu Hanifah.”
91.Reference was also made to writings with respect to ‘talaq-e-biddat’
by scholars of other schools.  In this behalf, the Court’s attention was
invited to the following:
“(i) Most of the Ulema take the innovative divorce as effective (Baday
al-sanay, fasl Hukum Talaq-al Bidaa, Kitab al-Talaq, 3/153).  
(ii) What do you think about the effectiveness of pronouncing divorce
thrice upon one’s pregnant wife either in one go or in three different
sessions, Imam Malik replied in the affirmative. (AI-Mudawwana, 2/68)
147(iii) The validity of triple talaq is also endorsed by all Ahl Al Sunnah
jurists.  Allama Ibn Quda ma adds that: “This view is attributed to
Abdul/ah  ibn  Abbas.   The  same  stance  is  shared  by  most  of  the
successors and later scholars.” (AI-Mughni Ii Ibn Qudama, 10/334)
(iv) The Book, Sunnah, and the consensus view of classical authorities is
that Triple Talaq is effective, even if pronounced in one go.  The act in
itself is, however, a sin.” (Ahkam al-Quran Iil Jassas, 2/85)
(v) Imam Shafe’I (of Shafe’I School) has stated as follows in his book
entitled as Al-Umm (fifth volume):
If he says you are divorced absolutely, with the intention of triple divorce
then it will be considered triple divorce and if he intends one it will be
considered one divorce and if he says you are divorced with the intention
of three it will be considered three. (page 359)
(vi)  Mauffaqud  Din  Abi  Muhammed  Abdillah  Ben  Ahmed  Ben
Muhammed  Ben  Qudamah  Al-Muqaddasi  Al-Jammaili  Al-Dimashqi
Al-Salihi  Al-Hanbali  (of  the  Hanbali  School)  in  his  book  entitled  as
Al-Mughni (tenth volume) has stated as follows:
Ahmed said: If he says to wife: Divorce yourself, intending three, and she
has divorced herself thrice, it will be considered three, and if he has
intended one then it will considered one. (page 394)
(vii) Allama Ibn Qudama, a Hanbali jurist is of the view that if one
divorces thrice with a single utterance, this divorce will be effective and
she  will  be  unlawful  for  him  until  she  marries  domeone  else.
Consummation of marriage is immaterial.  The validity of Triple Talaq is
also endorsed by all Ahl Al Sunnah juristics.  Allama Ibn Qudamma adds
that: “This view is attributed to Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abu Huraira, Umar,
Abdullah ibn Umar, Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Aas, Abdullah ibn Masud, and
Anas.  The same stance is shared by most of the successors and later
scholars.”” (Al-Mughni li Ibn Qudama, 10,334)”.
92.Based  on  the  ‘hadiths’  depicted  in  the  foregoing,  and  in  the
paragraphs preceding thereto, it was submitted, that for the Hanafi school
of Sunni Muslims ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq was a part and parcel of
their ‘personal law’, namely, a part and parcel of their faith, which they had
followed  generation  after  generation,  over  centuries.   That  being  the
position, it was submitted, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ should be treated as the
constitutionally protected fundamental right of Muslims, which could not be
interfered with on the touchstone of being violative of the fundamental
148rights, enshrined in the Constitution – or for that matter, constitutional
morality propounded at the behest of the petitioners.  
93.Learned senior counsel reiterated, that judicial intereference in the
matter of ‘personal law’ is not the proper course to be adopted for achieving
the  prayers  raised  by  the  petitoners.   Reference  was  made  by  a  large
number of Muslim countries across the world (-for details, refer to Part-5 –
Abrogation of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by legislation, the world over, in
Islamic, as well as, non-Islamic States), which had provided the necessary
succor by legislating on orthodox practices, which were not attuned to
present day social norms.  It was submitted, that in all the countries in
which the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ has been annulled or was being read
down,  as  a  matter  of  interpretation,  the  legislatures  of  the  respective
countries have interfered to bring in the said reform.
94.In order to fully express the ambit and scope of ‘personal law’, and
to  demonstrate  the  contours  of  the  freedom  of  conscience  and  free
profession, practice and propagation of religion propounded in Article 25,
learned  senior  counsel  placed  reliance  on  the  Constituent  Assembly
debates.  Interestingly reference was, first of all, made to Article 44 of the
Contitution, which is extracted below:
“44. Uniform civil code for the citizens.- The State shall endeavour to
secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of
India.”
It is necessary to notice, that during the Constituent Assembly debates, the
present Article 44 was numbered as draft Article 35.  During the course of
the Constituent Assembly debates, amendments to draft Article 35 were
149proposed by Mohamed Ismail Sahib, Naziruddin Ahmad, Mahboob Ali Beg,
Sahib  Bahadur  and  Pocker  Sahib  Bahadur.   Relevant  extract  of  their
amendments and their explanations thereto are reproduced below:
“Mr.  Mohamad  Ismail  Sahib  (Madras:  Muslim):  Sir,  I  move  that  the
following proviso be added to article 35:
""Provided that any group, section or community of people shall not be
obliged to give up its own personal lawin case it has such a law .""
The right of a group or a community of people to followand adhere to its
own personal law is among the fundamentalrights and this provision
should really be made amongst thestatutory and justiciable fundamental
rights. It is for thisreason that I along with other friends have given
amendmentsto certain other articles going previous to this which I will
move at the proper time .
Now the right to follow personal law is part of the wayof life of those
people who are following such laws; it ispart of their religion and part of
their  culture.  Ifanything  is  done  affecting  the  personal  laws,  it  will
betantamount to interference with the way of life of thosepeople who
have been observing these laws for generationsand ages. This secular
State which we are trying to createshould not do anything to interfere
with theway of life and religion of the people . The matter ofretaining
personal law is nothing new; we have precedents inEuropean countries.
Yugoslavia, for instance, that is, thekingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes, is obliged undertreaty obligations to guarantee the rights of
minorities.The clause regarding rights of Mussulmans reads as follows:
""The Serb, Croat and Slovene State agrees to grant tothe Mussulmans in
the  matter  of  family  law  and  personalstatus  provisions  suitable  for
regulating these matters inaccordance with the Mussulman usage.""
We find similar clauses in several other Europeanconstitutions also. But
these refer to minorities while myamendment refers not to the minorities
alone but to allpeople including the  majority community, because  it
says,""Any group, section or community of people shall not beobliged"" etc.
Therefore it seeks to secure the rights of allpeople in regard to their
existing personal law.
Again this amendment does not seek to introduce anyinnovation or bring
in a new set of laws for the people, butonly wants the maintenance of the
personal law already existing among certain sections of people. Now why
do peoplewant a uniform civil code, as in article 35? Their ideaevidently
is to secure harmony through uniformity. But Imaintain that for that
purpose  it  is  not  necessary  toregiment  the  civil  law  of  the  people
including the personallaw. Such regimentation will bring discontent and
harmonywill be affected. But if people are allowed to follow theirown
personal law there will be no discontent ordissatisfaction. Every section
of the people, being free tofollow its own personal law will not really come
in conflictwith others .
150Mr. Naziruddin Ahmad: Sir, I beg to move:
""That to article 35, the following proviso be added, namely: -
Provided  that  the  personal  law  of  any  community  which  has  been
guaranteed by the statue shall not be changedexcept with the previous
approval of the community ascertained in such manner as the Union
Legislature maydetermine by law .""
In moving this, I do not wish to confine my remarks tothe inconvenience
felt by the Muslim community alone. I would put it on a much broader
ground. In fact, eachcommunity, each religious community has certain
religious  laws,  certain  civil  laws  inseparably  connected  withreligious
beliefs and practices. I believe that in framing a uniform draft code these
religious laws or semi-religious laws should be kept out of its way. There
are several reasons which underlie this amendment. One of them is that
perhaps it clashes with article 19 of the Draft Constitution. In article 19
it is provided that `subject to public order, morality and health and to
the  other  provisions  of this Part, all  persons are equally entitled  to
freedom  of  conscience  and  the  right  freely  to  profess,  practise  and
propagate  religion.  In  fact,  this  is  so  fundamental  that the  Drafting
Committee  has  very  rightly  introduced  this  in  this  place.  Then  in
clause(2) of the same article it has been further provided by way of
limitation  of  the  right  that  `Nothing  in  this  article  shall  affect  the
operation of any existing law or preclude the State from making any law
regulating  or  restricting  any  economic,  financial,  political  or  other
secular activity which may be associated with religious practice'. I can
quite  see  that  there  may  be  many  pernicious  practices  which  may
accompany religious practices and they may be controlled. But there are
certain religious practices, certain religious laws  which do not come
within the exception in clause (2), viz. financial, political or other secular
activity  which  may  be  associated  with  religious  practices.  Having
guaranteed, and very rightly guaranteed the freedom of religious practice
and the freedom to propagate religion, I think the present article tries to
undo what has been given in article 19 . I submit, Sir, that we must try to
prevent this anomaly. In article 19 we enacted a positive provision which
is justiciable and which any subject of a State irrespective of his caste
and community can take to a Court of law and seek enforcement. On the
other hand, by the article under reference we are giving the State some
amount of latitude which may enable into ignore the right conceded. And
this right is not justiciable . It recommends to the State certain things
and therefore it gives a right to the State. But then the subject has not
been given any right under this provision. Submit that the present article
is likely to encourage testate to break the guarantees given in article 19 .
I submit, Sir, there are certain aspects of the Civil Procedure Code which
have already interfered with our personal laws and very rightly so. But
during the 175 years of British rule, they did not interfere with certain
fundamental personal laws. They have enacted the Registration Act, the
Limitation Act, the Civil Procedure Code, the Criminal Procedure Code,
the Penal Code, the Evidence Act, the Transfer of Property Act, the Sarda
Act  and  various  other  Acts.  They  have  been  imposed  gradually  as
151occasion  arose  and  they  were  intended  to  make  the  laws  uniform
although they clash with the personal laws of particular community. But
take the case of marriage practice and the laws of inheritance. They have
never interfered with them. It will be difficult at this stage of our society
to ask the people to give up their ideas of marriage, which are associated
with religious institutions in many communities. The laws of inheritance
are also supposed to be the result of religious injunctions. I submit that
the interference with these matters should be gradual and must progress
with the advance of time. I have no doubt that a stage would come when
the civil law would be uniform. But then that time has not yet come. We
believe that the power that has been given to the State to make the Civil
Code uniform is in advance of the time. As it is, any State would be
justified under article 35 to interfere with the settled laws of the different
communities at once. For instance, there remarriage practices in various
communities. If we want to introduce a law that every marriage shall be
registered and if not it will not be valid, we can do so under article 35.
But would you invalidate a marriage which is valid under the existing
law and under the present religious beliefs and practices on the ground
that it has not been registered under any new law and thus bastardize
the children born ?
This is only one instance of how interference can go too far. As I have
already submitted, the goal should be towards a uniform civil code but it
should be gradual and with the consent of the people concerned. I have
therefore in my amendment suggested that religious laws relating to
particular communities should not be affected except with their consent
to be ascertained in such manner as Parliament may decide by law.
Parliament may well decide to ascertain the consent of the community
through  their  representatives,  and  this  could  be  secured  by  the
representatives by their election speeches and pledges . In fact, this may
be made an article of faith in an election, and a vote on that could be
regarded as consent. These are matters of detail. I have attempted by my
amendment  to  leave  it  to  the  Central  Legislature  to  decide  how  to
ascertain this consent. Submit, Sir, that this is not a matter of mere
idealism. It is a question of stern reality which we must not refuse to face
and I believe it will lead to a considerable amount of misunderstanding
and resentment amongst the various sections of the country. What the
British in 175 years failed to door was afraid to do, what the Muslims in
the course of 500 years refrained from doing, we should not give power
to testate to do all at once . I submit, Sir, that we should proceed not in
haste but with caution, with experience, with statesmanship and with
sympathy.
Mahbood Ali Baig Sahib Bahadur: Sir, I move that the following proviso
be added to article 35:
""Provided that nothing in this article shall affect the personal law of the
citizen.""
My view of article 35 is that the words ""Civil Code"" do not cover the
strictly personal law of a citizen. The Civil Code covers laws of this kind:
laws of property, transfer of property, law of contract, law of evidence etc.
152The law as observed by a particular religious community is not covered
by article 35. That is my view. Anyhow, in order to clarify the position
that article 35 does not affect the personal law of the citizen, I have given
notice of this amendment. Now, Sir, if for any reason the framers of this
article have got in their minds that the personal law of the citizen is also
covered by the expression ""Civil Code"", I wish to submit that they are
overlooking the very important fact of the personal law being so much
dear  and  near  to  certain  religious  communities.  As  far  as  the
Mussalmans  are  concerned,  their  laws  of  succession,  inheritance,
marriage and divorce are completely dependent upon their religion .
Shri M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar: It is a matter of contract.
Mahboob  Ali  Baig  Sahib  Bahadur:  I  know  that  Mr.Ananthasayanam
Ayyangar  has  always  very  queer  ideas  about  the  laws  of  other
communities. It is interpreted as contract, while the marriage amongst
the Hindus is a Samskara and that among Europeans it is a matter of
status.  I  know  that  very  well,  but  this  contract  is  enjoined  on  the
Mussalmans by the Quran and if it is not followed, marriage is not a
legal marriage at all.  For 1350 years this law has been practised by
Muslims and recognised by all authorities in all states. If today Mr.
Ananthasayanam Ayyangar is going to say that some other method of
proving the marriage is going to be introduced, we refuse to abide by it
because it is not according to our religion. It is not according to the code
that is laid down for us for all times in this matter. Therefore, Sir, it is
not a matter to be treated so lightly. I know that in the case of some
other communities also, their personal law depends entirely upon their
religious tenets. If some communities have got their own way of dealing
with their religious tenets and practices, that cannot be imposed on a
community which insists that their religious tenets should be observed .
B. Pocker Sahib Bahadur (Madras: Muslim): Mr. Vice-President, Sir, I
support the motion which has already been moved by Mr. Mohamed
Ismail Sahib to the effect that the following proviso be added to article
35: -
""Provide that any group, section or community of people shall not be
obliged to give up its own personal law in casein has such a law .""
It is a very moderate and reasonable amendment to this article 35. Now I
would request the House to consider this amendment not from the point
of view of the Mussalman community alone, but from the point of view of
the various communities that exist in this country, following various
codes  of  law,  with  reference  to  inheritance,  marriage,  succession,
divorce, endowments and so many other matters. The House will not
that  one  of  the  reasons  why  the  Britisher,  having  conquered  this
country, has been able to carry on the administration of this country for
the last 150 years and over was that he gave a guarantee of following
their  own  personal  laws  to  each  of  the  various  communities  in  the
country. That is one of the secrets of success and the basis of the
administration of justice on which even the foreign rule was based. I ask,
Sir, whether by the freedom we have obtained for this country, are we
going to give up that freedom of conscience and that freedom of religious
153practices and that freedom of following one's own personal law and try or
aspire to impose upon the whole country one code of civil law, whatever
it may mean, - which I say, as it is, may include even all branches of civil
law, namely, the law of marriage, law of inheritance, law of divorce and
so many other kindred matters ?
In the first place, I would like to know the real intention with which this
clause has been introduced. If the words ""Civil Code"" are intended only
to apply to matters procedure like the Civil Procedure Code and such
other laws which are uniform so far as India is concerned at present
well, nobody has any objection to that, but the various civil Courts Acts
in  the  various  provinces  in  this  country  have  secured  for  each
community the right to follow their personal laws as regards marriage,
inheritance, divorce, etc. But if it is intended that the aspiration of the
State should be to override all these provisions and to have uniformity of
law to be imposed upon the whole people on these matters which are
dealt with by the Civil Courts Acts in the various provinces, well, I would
only say, Sir, that it is a tyrannous provision which ought not to be
tolerated; and let it not be taken that I am only voicing forth the feelings
of the Mussalmans. In saying this, I am voicing forth the feelings of ever
so  many  sections  in  this  country  who  feel  that  it  would  be  really
tyrannous to interfere with the religious practices, and with the religious
laws, by which they are governed now .
xxx xxx xxx
If such a body as this interferes with the religious rights and practices, it
will  be  tyrannous.  These  organisations  have  used  a  much  stronger
language than I amusing, Sir. Therefore, I would request the Assembly
not to consider what I have said entirely as coming from the point of view
of the Muslim community. I know there are great differences in the law of
inheritance and various other matters between the various sections of
the Hindu community. Is this Assembly going to set aside all these
differences and make them uniform? By uniform, I ask, what do you
mean and which particular law, of which community are you going to
take as the standard? What have you got in your mind in enacting a
clause like this? There are the mitakshara and Dayabaga systems; there
are so many other systems followed by various other communities. What
is it that you are making the basis?
Is it open to us to do anything of this sort? By this one clause you are
revolutionising the whole country and the whole setup. There is no need
for it.
Sir, as already pointed out by one of my predecessors in speaking on this
motion, this is entirely antagonistic tithe  provision made as regards
Fundamental  Rights  in  article19.  If  it  is  antagonistic,  what  is  the
purpose served by clause like this? Is it open to this Assembly to pass by
one  stroke  of  the  pen  an  article  by  which  the  whole  country  is
revolutionised? Is it intended? I do not know what the framers of this
article mean by this. On a matter of such grave importance, I am very
sorry to find that the framers or the draftsmen of this article have not
bestowed sufficiently serious attention to that . Whether it is copied from
154anywhere or not, I do not know. Anyhow, if it is copied from anywhere, I
must condemn that provision even in that Constitution. It is very easy to
copy  sections  from  other  constitutions  of  countries  where  the
circumstances are entirely different. There are ever so many multitudes
of communities following various customs for centuries or thousands of
years. By one stroke of the pen you want to annul all that and make
them uniform. What is the purpose served? What is the purpose served
by this uniformity except to murder the consciences of the people and
make them feel that they are being trampled upon as regards their
religious rights and practices? Such a tyrannous measure ought not to
find a place in our Constitution . I submit, Sir, there are ever so many
sections of the Hindu community who are rebelling against this and who
voice forth their feelings in much stronger language than I am using. If
the  framers of  this  article say that even the majority community is
uniform in support of this, I would challenge them to say so. It is not so.
Even assuming that the majority community is of this view, I say, it has
to  be  condemned  and  it  ought  not  to  be  allowed,  because,  in  a
democracy, as I take it, it is the duty of the majority to secure the sacred
rights of every minority. It is a misnomer to call it a democracy if the
majority rides rough-shod over the rights of the minorities. It is not
democracy at all; it is tyranny . Therefore, I would submit to you and all
the Members of this House to take very serious notice of this article; it is
not a light thing to be passed like this.
In this connection, Sir, I would submit that I have given notice of an
amendment  to  the  Fundamental  Right  article  also.  This  is  only  a
Directive Principle.”
The above stated amendments proposed to draft Article 35 were opposed by
K.M. Munshi and Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar.  Relevant extracts of their
responses are reproduced below:
Shri  K.  M.  Munshi  (Bombay:  General):  Mr.  Vice-President,  I  beg  to
submit a few considerations. This particular clause which is now before
the House is not brought for discussion for the first time.  It has been
discussed in several committees and at several places before it came to
the House. The ground that is now put forward against it is, firstly that it
infringes the Fundamental Right mentioned in article 19; and secondly,
it is tyrannous to the minority .
As regards article 19 the House accepted it and made it quite clear
that-""Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law
or preclude the State from making any law (a) regulating or restricting""-I
am  omitting  the  unnecessary  words-""or  other  secular  activity  which
maybe  associated  with  religious  practices;  (b)  for  social  welfare  and
reforms"". Therefore the House has already accepted the principle that if a
religious practice followed so far covers a secular activity or falls within
the field of social reform or social welfare, it would be open to Parliament
155to make laws about it without infringing this Fundamental Right of a
minority.
It must also be remembered that if this clause is not put in, it does not
mean that the Parliament in future would have no right to enact a Civil
Code. The only restriction touch a right would be article 19 and I have
already pointed out that article 19, accepted by the House unanimously,
permits legislation covering secular activities. The whole object of this
article is that as and when the Parliament thinks proper or rather when
the majority in the Parliament thinks proper an attempt may be made to
unify the personal law of the country .
A further argument has been advanced that the enactment of a Civil
Code would be tyrannical to minorities. Is it tyrannical? Nowhere in
advanced Muslim countries the personal law of each minority has been
recognised as so sacrosanct as to prevent the enactment of a Civil Code.
Take for instance Turkey or Egypt. No minority in these countries is
permitted to have such rights. But I go further. When the Shariat Act
was passed or when certain laws were passed in the Central Legislature
in  the  old  regime,  the  Khojas  and  Cutchi  Memons  were  highly
dissatisfied.
They then followed certain Hindu customs; for generations since they
became converts they had done so. They did not want to conform to the
Shariat; and yet by legislation of the Central Legislature certain Muslim
members who felt that Shariat law should be enforced upon the whole
community carried their point. The Khojas and Cutchi Memons most
unwillingly had to submit to it. Where were the rights of minority then?
When  you want  to  consolidate  a community,  you  have  to  take  into
consideration the benefit which may accrue to the whole community and
motto the customs of a part of it. It is not therefore correct to say that
such an act is tyranny of the majority. If you will look at the countries in
Europe which have a Civil Code, everyone who goes there from any part
of the world and every minority, has to submit to the Civil Code. It is not
felt to be tyrannical to the minority. The point however is this, whether
we are going to consolidate and unify our personal law in such a way
that the way of life of the whole country may in course of time be unified
and secular. We want to divorce religion from personal law, from what
may be called social relations or from the rights of parties as regards
inheritance or succession. What have these things got to do with religion
I really fail to understand.  Take for instance the Hindu Law Draft which
is  before  the  Legislative  Assembly.  If  one  looks  at  Manu  and
Yagnyavalkya and all the rest of them, I think most of the provisions of
the new Bill will run counter to their injunctions. But after all we are an
advancing  society.  We  are  in  a  stage  where  we  must  unify  and
consolidate the nation by every means without interfering with religious
practices. If however the religious practices in the past have been so
construed as to cover the whole field of life, we have reached a point
when we must put our foot down and say that these matters are not
religion, they are purely matters for secular legislation. This is what is
emphasised by this article.
156Now look at the disadvantages that you will perpetuate if there is no Civil
Code.  Take  for  instance  the  Hindus.  We  have  the  law  of  Mayukha
applying in some parts of India; we have Mithakshara in others; and we
have  the  law-Dayabagha  in  Bengal.  In  this  way  even  the  Hindus
themselves have separate laws and most of our Provinces and States
have started making separate Hindu law for themselves. Are we going to
permit  this  piecemeal  legislation  on  the  ground  that  it  affects  the
personal law of the country? It is therefore not merely a question for
minorities but it also affects the majority.
I know there are many among Hindus who do not like a uniform Civil
Code,  because  they  take  the  same  view  as  the  honourable  Muslim
Members who spoke last. They feel that the personal law of inheritance,
succession etc. is really apart of their religion. If that were so, you can
never give, for instance, equality to women. But you have already passed
a Fundamental Right to that effect and you have an article here which
lays down that there should be no discrimination against sex. Look at
Hindu Law; you get any amount of discrimination against women; and if
that is part of Hindu religion or Hindu religious practice, you cannot
pass a single law which would elevate the position of Hindu women to
that of men. Therefore, there is no reason why there should not be a civil
code throughout the territory of India .
xxx xxx xxx
Shri Alladi Krishanaswami Ayyar (Madras: General): Mr. Vice-President, 
after the very full exposition of my friend the Honourable Mr. Munshi, it 
is not necessary to cover the whole ground. But it is as well to 
understand whether there can be any real objection to the article as it 
runs.
""The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code 
throughout the territory of India .""
xxx xxx xxx
Now,  my  friend  Mr.  Pocker  levelled  an  attack  against  the  Drafting
Committee on the ground that they did not know their business. I should
like to know whether he has carefully read what happened even in the
British regime. You must know that the Muslim law covers the field of
contracts, the field of criminal law, the field of divorce law, the field of
marriage and every part of law as contained in the Muslim law. When the
British occupied this country, they said, we are going to introduce one
criminal law in this country which will be applicable to all citizens, be
they Englishmen, be they Hindus, be they Muslims. Did the Muslims
take exception, and did they revolt against the British for introducing a
single system of criminal law? Similarly we have the law of contracts
governing transactions between Muslims and Hindus, between Muslims
and Muslims. They are governed not by the law of the Koran but by the
Anglo-Indian jurisprudence, yet no exception was taken to that. Again,
there are  various  principles  in  the  law of  transfer  which have  been
borrowed from the English jurisprudence .
Therefore, when there is impact between two civilizations or between two
cultures,  each  culture  must  be  influenced  and  influence  the  other
157culture.  If  there  is  a  determined  opposition,  or  if  there  is  strong
opposition by any section of the community, it would be unwise on the
part of the legislators of this country to attempt to ignore it. Today, even
without article 35, there is nothing to prevent the future Parliament of
India from passing such laws. Therefore, the idea is to have a uniform
civil code.
Now, again, there are Muslims and there are Hindus, there are Catholics,
there are Chistians, there are Jews, indifferent European countries. I
should like to know from Mr.Pocker whether different personal laws are
perpetuated in France, in Germany, in Italy and in all the continental
countries  of  Europe,  or  whether  the  laws  of  succession  aren’t
co-ordinated and unified in the various States. He must have made a
detailed study of Muslim jurisprudence and found out whether in all
those countries, there is a single system of law or different systems of
law.
Leave alone people who are there. Today, even in regard to people in
other parts of the country, if they have property in the continent of
Europe where the German Civil Code or the French Civil Code obtains,
the people are governed by the law of the place in very many respects.
Therefore, it is incorrect to say that we are invading the domain of
religion.  Under the Moslem law, unlike under Hindu law, marriage is
purely a civil contract. The idea of a sacrament does not enter into the
concept of marriage in Muslim jurisprudence though the incidence of the
contract may be governed by what is laid down in the Koran and by
theater jurists. Therefore, there is no question of religion being in danger.
Certainly no Parliament, no Legislature will be so unwise as to attempt
it, apart from the power of the Legislature to interfere with religious
tenets of peoples. After all the only community that is willing to adapt
itself to changing times seems to be the majority community in the
country. They are willing to take lessons from the minority and adapt
their Hindu Laws and take a leaf from the Muslims for the purpose of
reforming  even  the  Hindu  Law.  Therefore,  there  is  no  force  to  the
objection that is put forward to article 35 . The future Legislatures may
attempt a uniform Civil Code or they may not. The uniform Civil Code
will run into every aspect of Civil Law. In regard to contracts, procedure
and property uniformity is sought to be secured by their finding a place
in  the  Concurrent  List.  In  respect  of  these  matters  the  greatest
contribution  of  British  jurisprudence  has  been  to  bring  about  a
uniformity in these matters. We only go a step further than the British
who  ruled  in  this  country.  Why  should  you  distrust  much  more  a
national indigenous Government than a foreign Government which has
been ruling? Why should our Muslim friends have greater confidence,
greater faith in the British rule than in a democratic rule which will
certainly have regard to the religious tenets and beliefs of all people?
Therefore, for those reasons, I submit that the House may unanimously
pass this article which has been placed before the Members after due
consideration.”
158Before the amendments were put to vote, Dr. B.R. Ambedker made the
following observations:
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar: Sir, I am afraid I cannot accept the
amendments which have been moved to this article. In dealing with this
matter, I do not propose to touch on the merits of the question as to
whether this country should have a Civil Code or it should not. That is a
matter which I think has been dealt with sufficiently for the occasion by
my friend, Mr. Munshi, as well as by Shri Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar.
When  the  amendments  to  certain  fundamental  rights  are  moved,  it
would be possible for me to make a full statement on this subject, and I
therefore do not propose to deal with it here .
My friend, Mr. Hussain Imam, in rising to support the amendments,
asked whether it was possible and desirable to have a uniform Code of
laws for a country so vast as this is. Now I must confess that I was very
much surprised at that statement, for the simple reason that we have in
this country a uniform code of laws covering almost every aspect of
human relationship. We have a uniform and complete Criminal Code
operating throughout the country, which is contained in the Penal Code
and  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code.  We  have  the  Law  of  Transfer  of
Property, which deals with property relations and which is operative
throughout the country. Then there are the Negotiable Instruments Acts:
and I can cite innumerable enactments which would prove that this
country  has  practically  a  Civil  Code,  uniform  in  its  content  and
applicable to the whole of the country. The only province the Civil Law
has not been able to invade so far is Marriage and Succession. It is this
little corner which we have not been able to invade so far and it is the
intention  of  those  who  desire  to  have  article  35  as  part  of  the
Constitution  to  bring  about  that  change.  Therefore,  the  argument
whether  we  should  attempt  such  a  thing  seems  to  me  somewhat
misplaced  for  the  simple  reason  that  we  have,  as  a  matter  of  fact,
covered the whole lot of the field which is covered by a uniform Civil
Code in this country. It is therefore too late now to ask the question
whether we could do it. As I say, we have already done it .
Coming to the amendments, there are only two observations which I
would like to make. My first observation would be to state that members
who put forth these amendments say that the Muslim personal law, so
far as this country was concerned, was immutable and uniform through
the whole of India. Now I wish to challenge that statement. I think most
of my friends who have spoken on this amendment have quite forgotten
that up to 1935 the North-West Frontier Province was not subject to the
Shariat Law. It followed the Hindu Law in the matter of succession and
in other  matters, so much so that it was in 1939 that the Central
Legislature had to come into the field and to abrogate the application of
the Hindu Law to the Muslims of the North-West Frontier Province and
to apply the Shariat Law to them. That is not all.
159My honourable friends have forgotten, that, apart from the North-West
Frontier Province, up till 1937 in the rest of India, in various parts, such
as the United Provinces, the Central Provinces and Bombay, the Muslims
to a large extent were governed by the Hindu Law in the matter of
succession. In order to bring them on the plane of uniformity with regard
to the other Muslims who observed the Shariat Law, the Legislature had
to intervene in 1937 and to pass an enactment applying the Shariat Law
to the rest of India.
I am also informed by my friend, Shri Karunakara Menon, that in North
Malabar the Marumakkathayam Law applied to all-not only to Hindus
but also to Muslims. It is to be remembered that the Marumakkathayam
Law is a Matriarchal form of law and not a Partriarchal form of law.
The Mussulmans, therefore, in North Malabar were up to now following
the Marumakkathyam law. It is therefore no use making a categorical
statement that the Muslim law has been an immutable law which they
have  been  following  from  ancient  times.  That  law  as  such  was  not
applicable in certain parts and it has been made applicable ten years
ago. Therefore if it was found necessary that for the purpose of evolving a
single civil code applicable to all citizens irrespective of their religion,
certain portions of the Hindus, law, not because they were contained in
Hindu law but because they were found to be the most suitable, were
incorporated into the new civil code projected by article 35, I am quite
certain that it would not be open to any Muslim to say that the framers
of the civil code had done great violence to the sentiments of the Muslim
community.
My second observation is to give them an assurance . I quite realise their
feelings in the matter, but I think they have read rather too much into
article 35, which merely proposes that the  State shall endeavour to
secure a civil code for the citizens of the country . It does not say that
after the Code is framed the State shall enforce it upon all citizens
merely because they are citizens. It is perfectly possible that the future
parliament may make a provision byway of making a beginning that the
Code shall apply only to those who make a declaration that they are
prepared to be bound by it, so that in the initial stage the application of
the Code may be purely voluntary. Parliament may feel the ground by
some such method. This is not a novel method. It was adopted in the
Shariat Act of 1937 when it was applied to territories other than the
North-West Frontier Province. The law said that here is a Shariat law
which should be applied to Mussulmans who wanted that he should be
bound by the Shariat Act should go to an officer of the state, make a
declaration that he is willing to be bound by it, and after he has made
that declaration the law will bind him and his successors. It would be
perfectly possible for parliament to introduce a provision of that sort; so
that the fear which my friends have expressed here will be altogether
nullified.  I  therefore  submit  that  there  is  no  substance  in  these
amendments and I oppose them .”
160When the matter was put to vote by the Vice President of the Constituent
Assembly, it was resolved as under:
“Mr. Vice-President: The question is:
""That the following proviso be added to article 35:
`Provided that any group, section or community or people shall not be 
obliged to give up its own personal law in case it has such a law'.""
The motion was negatived.”
Based on the Constituent Assembly debates with reference to draft Article
35, which was incorporated in the Constitution as Article 44 (extracted
above), it was submitted, that as expressed in Article 25(2)(b), so also the
debates of Article 44, the intent of the Constituent Assembly was to protect
‘personal laws’ of different communities by elevating their stature to that of
other fundamental rights, however with the rider, that the legislature was
competent to amend the same.
95.Sequentially, learned senior counsel invited our attention to the
Constituent Assembly debates with reference to Article 25 so as to bring
home his contention, that the above article preserved to all their ‘personal
laws’ by elevating the same to the stature of a fundamental right.  The
instant elevation, it was pointed out, was by incorporating Articles 25 and
26 as components of Part III – Fundamental Rights, of the Constitution.  It
would be relevant to record, that Article 25 as it now exists, was debated as
draft Article 19 by the Constituent Assembly.  It was pointed out, that only
one amendment proposed by Mohamed Ismail Sahib and its response by Pt.
Laxmikanta  Mitra  would  bring  home  the  proposition  being  canvassed,
namely,  that  ‘personal  laws’  were  inalienable  rights  of  individuals  and
permitted  them  to  be  governed  in  consonance  with  their  faith.   The
161amendment proposed by Mohamed Ismail Sahib and his statement in that
behalf  before  the  Constituent  Assembly,  as  is  relevant  for  the  present
controversy, is being extracted hereunder:
“Mr. Mohamed Ismail Sahib: Thank you very much, Sir, forgiving me
another opportunity to put my views before the House on this very
important matter. I beg to move:
""That after clause (2) of article 19, the following new clause be added:
‘(3) Nothing in clause (2) of this article shall affect the right of any citizen
to follow the personal law of the group or the community to which he
belongs or professes to belong.'""
Sir, this provision which I am suggesting would only recognise the age
long right of the people to follow their own personal law, within the limits
of their families and communities. This does not affect in any way the
members of other communities. This does not encroach upon the rights
of the members of other communities to follow their own personal law. It
does not mean any sacrifice at all on the part of the members of any
other community. Sir, here what we are concerned with is only the
practice  of  the  members  of  certain  families  coming  under  one
community. It is a family practice and in such cases as succession,
inheritance and  disposal  of properties  by way of wakf and  will,  the
personal law operates. It is only with such matters that we are concerned
under  personal  law.  In other  matters,  such  as  evidence,  transfer  of
property, contracts and in innumerable other questions of this sort, the
civil code will operate and will apply to every citizen of the land, to
whatever community he may belong. Therefore, this will not in any way
detract from the desirable amount of uniformity which the state may try
to bring about, in the matter of the civil law .
This  practice  of  following personal  law  has  been  there  amongst  the
people for ages. What I want under this amendment is that that practice
should not be disturbed now and I want only the continuance of a
practice that has been going on among the people for ages past . On a
previous  occasion  Dr.  Ambedkar  spoke  about  certain  enactments
concerning Muslim personal law, enactments relating to Wakf, Shariat
law  and  Muslim  marriage  law.  Here  there  was  no  question  of  the
abrogation of the Muslim personal law at all. There was no revision at all
and in all those cases what was done was that the Muslim personal law
was elucidated and it was made clear that these laws shall apply to the
Muslims. They did not modify them at all.  Therefore those enactments
and legislations cannot be cited now as matters of precedents for us to
do anything contravening the personal law of the people. Under this
amendment what I want the House to accept is that when we speak of
the State doing anything with reference to the secular aspect of religion,
the question of the personal law shall not be brought in and it shall not
be affected.
162xxx xxx xxx
The question of professing, practising and propagating one’s faith is a
right which the human being had from the very beginning of time and
that has been recognised as an inalienable right of every human being,
not only in this land but the whole world over and I think that nothing
should be done to affect that right of man as a human being. That part of
the article as it stands is properly worded and it should stand as it is.
That is my view .
Another honourable Member spoke about the troubles that had arisen as
a result of the propagation of religion. I would say that the troubles were
not  the  result  of  the  propagation  of  religion  or  the  professing  or
practicing of religion . They arose as a result of the misunderstanding of
religion. My point of view, and I say that that is the correct point of view,
is that if only people understand their respective religions aright and if
they  practise  them  aright  in  the  proper  manner  there  would  be  no
trouble whatever; and because there was some trouble due to some
cause it does not stand to reason that the fundamental right of a human
being to practise and propagate his religion should be abrogated in any
way.”
The response of Pt. Laxmikanta Mitra is reproduced below:
“Pandit Lakshmi Kanta Mitra (West Bengal: General): Sir, I feel myself
called upon to put in a few words to explain the general implications of
this article so as to remove some of the misconceptions that have arisen
in the minds of some of my honourable Friends over it.
This article 19 of the Draft Constitution confers on all person the right to
profess, practise and propagate any religion they like but this right has
been circumscribed by certain conditions which the State would be free
to impose in the interests of public morality, public order and public
health and also in so far as the right conferred here does not conflict in
any way with the other provisions elaborated under this part of the
Constitution. Some of my Friends argued that this right ought not to be
permitted in this Draft Constitution for the simple reason that we have
declared time and again that this is going to be a secular State and as
such practice of religion should not be permitted as a fundamental right.
It has been further argued that by conferring the additional right to
propagate a particular faith or religion the door is opened for all manner
of troubles and conflicts which would eventually paralyse the normal life
of the State. I would say at once that this conception of a secular State is
wholly wrong. (By secular State, as I understand it, is meant that the
State is not going to make any discrimination whatsoever on the ground
of religion or community against any person professing any particular
form of religious faith. This means in essence that no particular religion
in the State will receive any State patronage whatsoever. The State is not
going to establish, patronise or endow any particular religion to the
exclusion of or in preference to others and that no citizen in the State
will  have any preferential  treatment or  will  be discriminated  against
simply on the ground that he professed a particular form of religion. In
other words in the affairs of the State the professing of any particular
163religion will not be taken into consideration at all.) This I consider to be
the essence of a secular state. At the same time we must be very careful
to see that this land of ours we do not deny to anybody the right not only
to profess or practise but also to propagate any particular religion . Mr.
Vice-President, this glorious land of ours is nothing if it does not stand
for lofty religious and spiritual concepts and ideals. India would not be
occupying any place of honour on this globe if she had not reached that
spiritual height which she did in her glorious past. Therefore I feel that
the Constitution has rightly provided for this not only as a right but also
as a fundamental right. In the exercise of this fundamental right every
community inhabiting this State professing any religion will have equal
right and equal facilities to do whatever it likes in accordance with its
religion provided it does not clash with the conditions laid down here .”
In addition to the above, it is only relevant to mention, that the amendment
proposed  by  Mohamed  Ismail  Sahib  was  negatived  by  the  Constituent
Assembly.
96.While concluding his submissions Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned Senior
Advocate,  focused  his  attention  to  the  Muslim  Personal  Law  (Shariat)
Application, 1937 and invited our attention to some of the debates which
had  taken  place  when  the  Bill  was  presented  before  the  Legislative
Assembly.  Reference is only necessary to the statements made by H.M.
Abdullah and Abdul Qaiyum on the floor of the House.  The same are
extracted hereunder:
“Mr H. M. Abdullah (West Central Punjab: Muhammadan): Sir, I beg to
move: ""That the Bill to make provision for the application of the Moslem
Personal Law (Shariat) to Moslems in British India, as reported by the
Select Committee, be taken into consideration."" 
The object of the Bill, as the House is already aware, is to replace the
customary law by the Shari at law in certain matters where the parties to
a dispute are Muslims. By doing so, it also helps the weaker sex as it
enables  women  to  succeed  to  the  ancestral  property  and  to  claim
dissolution of marriage on certain grounds . After explaining the object of
the Bill briefly, it gives me great pleasure to say that the Bill has met
with a unanimous support from the Select Committee except in one or
two points. Objection has been taken to the words ""or Law"" in clause 2 of
the Bill by Messrs Mudie, Muhammad Azhar Ali and Sir Muhammad
164Yarnin Khan in their minutes of dissent. As there is an amendment on
the agenda for the omission of these words, I shall deal with it when it is
moved. Meanwhile, I would confine my remarks to the modifications
suggested by the Select Committee.  The main changes made by it are
two,  one  relating  to  the  exclusion  of  the  agricultural  land  from  the
purview of the Bill, and the other concerning the amplification of the
word  ""divorce"" .  As  succession  to  agricultural  land  is  an  exclusively
provincial subject under the Government of India Act, 1935, it had,
much against my wish, to be excluded from the Bill. Having regard to the
different forms of dissolution of marriage recognised by the Shariat, it
was  considered  necessary  to  provide  for  all  of  them.  In  order  to
implement  the  provisions  in  this  respect,  a  new  clause  3  has  been
inserted in the Bill empowering the District Judge to grant dissolution of
marriage on petition of a married Muslim woman on certain grounds.
These changes have been introduced in the interest of the females who,
in such matters, are at present at the mercy of their husbands . 
I am sure that these wholesome changes will be supported by the House.
In addition to the above, the Select Committee have made a few other
amendments which are fully explained in the report, and I need not take
the time of the House in dilating upon them. I hope that the Bill in its
present form will meet with the approval of the whole House. 
Sir, I move. 
Mr Deputy President (Mr Akhil Chandra Dattas): Motion moved: ""That
the Bill to make provision for the application of the Moslem Personal Law
(Shariat)  to  Moslems  in  British  India,  as  reported  by  the  Select
Committee, be taken into consideration."" 
Mr Abdul Qaiyum (North-West Frontier Province: General): Sir, I am in
sympathy with the objects which this very useful Bill aims at. There is a
great  awakening  among  the  Muslim  masses,  and  they  are  terribly
conscious  of  their  wretched  condition  socially,  politically  and
economically. There is a desire in the 107 108 Appendix B community for
an advance in all these directions. The feelings of the Muslim community
have  been  expressed  in  public  meetings  throughout  the  length  and
breadth of this country. This feeling, I have great pleasure in stating, is
not merely confined to males but it has spread to the females also, and
for the first time the Muslim women in India have given expression to
their strong feelings against the dead hand of customary law which has
reduced them into the position of chattels. Sir, these feelings have been
expressed by various organisations of Muslim women throughout India.
A representative body of Muslim Ulema like the Jamait-ulUlemai-Hind
has also expressed its sympathy with the objects of this Bill . Sir, there is
something in the word Shariat, -may be it is Arabic, - which gives a sort
of fright to some of my Honourable friends, but I think if they try to read
the  Muhammadan  Law  on  the  point,  especially  on  the  point  of
succession, they will realise that this Bill was long overdue and that it is
a  step  in  the  right  direction.  People  have  no  idea  of  what  terrible
conditions the Muslim women have had to endure in my own Province : I
can say that whenever a Muslim died, at least before the Frontier Shariat
165Law was enacted in the North-West Frontier Province, his daughter, his
sister  and  his  wife  all  used  to  be  thrown  into  the  street,  and  the
reversioner in the tenth degree would come round and collar all his
property. I think that the conscience of all those who believe in progress,
social, political and economic will revolt against such practice and once
people realise that this Bill is primarily intended to improve the status of
women and to confer upon them benefits which are lawfully their due
under the Muhammadan law, then they will gladly support this measure .
'Custom' is a very indefinite term. I know it as a lawyer that in my
Province whenever a question of custom used to crop up it used to
involve  any  amount  of  research  work,  lawyers  used  to  indulge  in
research work to find out cases, look up small books on customary law
and it was found that the custom varied from tribe to tribe, from village
to village and it has been held, by the High Court in our Province before
the Shariat Act came into force, that custom varied from one part of the
village to the other. The position was so uncertain that people had to
spend so much money on litigation that by the time litigation came to an
end the property for which people were fighting would disappear. It was
with a view to put an end to this uncertainty that people in the Frontier
Province pressed for an Act which was subsequently passed into law . 
I have only one thing to say. Personally I want the Muslims in India in
matters affecting them to follow the personal law of the Muslims as far as
they can. I want them to move in this direction because it is a thing
which is going to help the Muslims and because the Muslims form a very
important minority community in this country- they are 80 millions - all
well-wishers of this country will agree with me that if it enhances the
states of Muslims, if it brings the much needed relief to the Muslim
women,  it  will  be  a  good  thing  for  the  cause  of  the  Indian  nation .
Therefore, in our Province an Act was passed which goes much further
than  this  particular  Bill  which  is  now  under  discussion  before  this
House. It is a very well-known fact that under the new Government of
India Act, agricultural land and waqfs and religious trusts are provincial
subjects and that this Honourable House cannot legislate about matters
which are now on the provincial legislative list. The Act which we have in
the Frontier Province, Act VI of 1935, goes much further than this Bill
because it includes agricultural land and religious trusts. Therefore, I
have tabled an amendment that this particular Bill - though I heartily
agree with the principles of Appendix B 109 the Bill - when enacted into
law, should not be extended to our Province. If it is so extended, it would
mean that the people of the Frontier Province would be taking a step
backward and not forwards. It is well-known fact and it is laid down in
the Government of India Act, Section 107, that where a Federal Law
comes into conflict with a Provincial Law and even if the Federal Law has
been passed after the Provincial Law, then to that extent it over-rides the
Provincial law and the Provincial Law becomes null and void. Therefore,
my submission is that the intention with which I tabled my amendment
was not with any idea of opposing the object of this Bill, but my reason
for moving this amendment is that this Bill does not go as far as we wish
166to go -at least in one Province, namely, the North-West Frontier Province.
I submit this is a measure which has been long overdue. I have known
cases  where  a  widow  who  was  enjoying  life  estate  -  and  whose
reversioners were waiting for her death - did not die but happened to
have a very long life. There have been cases in the Northwest Frontier
Province where people have taken the law into their own hands and in
order to get the property they have murdered the widow. I can cite other
cases before this Honourable House. There have been cases which I have
come across in my legal and professional career where, when a man dies
leaving a wife who by customary law has to enjoy the property till her
death or remarriage, certain reversioners come forward and bring a suit
to declare that the widow had married one of the reversioners with a view
to proving that she was no longer a widow and with a view to terminate
her life estate . There have been numerous cases where families have
been ruined, murderers and stabbings have taken place because the
dead hand of customary law stood in the way of the reversioners who
were anxious to get what they could not get and in order to deprive the
poor widow, false cases have been tromped up that she had remarried.
There have been many other illegal tricks resorted to by people with a
view to get hold of the property. I submit, Sir, that the dead hand of
customary law must be removed. We are living in an age in which very
important changes are taking place. After all this customary law is a
thing of the past When many other things are going the way of all flesh,
when even systems of Government have to change, when even mighty
Empires have disappeared, when we see signs of softening even in the
hearts of the Government of India, when we have got popular Congress
Governments in seven Provinces - a thing which nobody would have
believed six months ago or one year ago. I submit that it is high time that
we got rid of this dead hand of custom.  After all custom is a horrible
thing as far as this particular matter is concerned, and by endorsing the
principles of this Bill we would be doing justice to millions of Indian
women who profess Muslim faith. I hope, Sir, the day is not far off when
other communities will also bring similar measures and when in India
women and men will be treated equally in the eyes of law in the matter of
property, political rights, social rights and in all other respects. I have,
therefore, great pleasure in supporting the principles of this Bill .”
Based on the aforesaid debates and the details expressed hereinabove (-for
details, refer to Part-4 – Legislation in India, in the field of Muslim ‘personal
law’), it was contended, that the main object of the legislation was not to
express the details of the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  The object was
merely to do away with customs and usages as were in conflict with Muslim
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was therefore submitted, that it would not be
167proper to hold, that by the Shariat Act, the legislature gave statutory status
to Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It would be necessary to understand
the above enactment, as statutorily  abrogating customary practices and
usages,  as  were  in  conflict  with  the  existing  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –
‘Shariat’.  It was submitted, that the above enactment did not decide what
was, or was not, Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It would therefore be a
misnomer to consider that the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application
Act, 1937, in any way, legislated on the above subject.  It was pointed out,
that  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’  comprised  of  the  declarations
contained in the Quran, or through ‘hadiths’, ‘ijmas’  and ‘qiyas’ (-for details,
refer to Part-2 – The practiced modes of ‘talaq’ amongst Muslims).  It was
pointed out, that the articles of faith, as have been expressed on a variety of
subjects of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, have been in place ever since
they were declared by the Prophet Mohammed.  Insofar as the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ is concerned, it was submitted, that it has been practised
amongst Muslims for the last 1400 years.  It was submitted, that the same
is an accepted mode of divorce amongst Muslims.  It was therefore urged,
that it was not for this Court to decide, whether the aforesaid practice was
just and equitable.  The reason for this Court not to interfere with the same,
it was submitted was, that the same was a matter of faith, of a majority of
Muslims in this country, and this Court would be well advised to leave such
a practice of faith, to be determined in the manner as was considered fit by
those who were governed thereby.  A belief, according to learned senior
counsel, which is practiced for 1400 years, is a matter of faith, and is
168protected under Article 25 of the Constitution.  Matters of belief and faith, it
was submitted, have been accepted to constitute the fundamental rights of
the  followers  of  the  concerned  religion.   Only  such  practices  of  faith,
permitted to be interfered with under Article 25(1), as are opposed to public
order, morality and health.  It was pointed out, that in addition to the
above,  a  court  could  interfere  only  when  articles  of  faith  violated  the
provisions of Part III – Fundamental Rights, of the Constitution.  Insofar as
the  reliance  placed  by  the  petitioners  on  Articles  14,  15  and  21  is
concerned, it was submitted, that Articles 14, 15 and 21 are obligations
cast on the State, and as such, were clearly inapplicable to matters of
‘personal law’, which cannot be attributed to State action.
97.While  concluding  his  submissions,  learned  senior  counsel  also
affirmed, that he would file an affidavit on behalf of the AIMPLB.  The
aforesaid affidavit was duly filed, which reads as under:
“1.  I am the Secretary of All India Muslim Personal Law Board which has
been arraigned as Respondent No.3 and as Respondent No.8 respectively
to the above-captioned Writ Petitions.  I am conversant with the facts
and circumstances of the present case and I am competent to swear this
Affidavit.
2. I say and submit that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board will
issue an advisory through its Website, Publications and Social Media
Platforms and thereby advise the persons who perform ‘Nikah’ (marriage)
and request them to do the following:-
(a) At the time of performing ‘Nikah’ (Marriage), the person performing
the ‘Nikah’ will advise the Bridegroom/Man that in case of differences
leading to Talaq the Bridegroom/Man shall not pronounce three divorces
in one sitting since it is an undesirable practice in Shariat;
(b)  That  at  the  time  of  performing  ‘Nikah’  (Marriage),  the  person
performing the ‘Nikah’ will advise both the Bridegroom/Man and the
Bride/Woman to incorporate a condition in the ‘Nikahnama’ to exclude
resorting to pronouncement of three divorces by her husband in one
sitting.
3. I say and submit that, in addition, the Board is placing on record, that
the Working Committee of the Board had earlier already passed certain
169resolutions in the meeting held on 15  th   and 16  th   April, 2017 in relation to
Divorce (Talaq) in the Muslim community.  Thereby it was resolved to
convey a code of conduct/guidelines to be followed in the matters of
divorce  particularly  emphasizing  to  avoid  pronouncement  of  three
divorces in one sitting .  A copy of the resolution dated April 16, 2017
alongwith the relevant Translation of Resolution Nos. 2, 3, 4 & 5 relating
to Talaq (Divorce) is enclosed herewith for the perusal of this Hon’ble
Court and marked as Annexure A-1 (Colly) [Page Nos.4 to 12] to the
present Affidavit.”
Based on the above affidavit, it was contended, that social reforms with
reference to ‘personal law’ must emerge from the concerned community
itself.  It was reiterated, that no court should have any say in the matter of
reforms to ‘personal law’.  It was submitted, that it was not within the
domain of judicial discretion to interfere with the matters of ‘personal law’
except on grounds depicted in Article 25(1) of the Constitution.  It was
contended, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was not liable to be set aside,
on any of the above grounds.
98.While  supplementing  the  contentions  noticed  in  the  preceding
paragraph, it was submitted, that Article 25(2)(b) vested the power with the
legislature, to interfere with ‘personal law’ on the ground of social welfare
and reform.  It was therefore contended, that the prayer  made by the
petitioner  and  those  supporting the  petitioner’s  case  before  this  Court,
should be addressed to the members of the community who are competent
to amend the existing traditions, and alternatively to the legislature which is
empowered to legislatively abrogate the same, as a measure of social welfare
and reform.  With the above observations, learned senior counsel prayed for
the rejection of the prayers made by the petitioners.
17099.Mr. Raju Ramachandran, Senior Advocate, entered appearance on
behalf of Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, i.e., respondent no.1 in Suo Motu Writ
Petition (Civil) No.2 of 2015 and respondent no.9 in Writ Petition (Civil)
No.118  of  2016.   At  the  beginning  of  his  submissions,  learned  senior
counsel stated, that he desired to endorse each one of the submissions
advanced  before  this  Court  by  Mr.  Kapil  Sibal,  Senior  Advocate.   We
therefore hereby record the aforesaid contention of learned senior counsel.
100.In addition to the above, it was submitted, that the cause raised by
the petitioner (and others) before this Court was clearly frivolous.  It was
submitted, that under the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, parties at the
time of executing ‘nikahnama’ (marriage deed) are free to incorporate terms
and conditions, as may be considered suitable by them.  It was submitted,
that it was open to the wife, at the time of executing ‘nikahnama’, to provide
therein, that her husband would not have the right to divorce her through a
declaration in the nature of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was therefore submitted,
that it was clearly misconceived for the petitioner to approach this Court to
seek a declaration against the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  Alternatively, it
was contended, that after the enactment of the Special Marriage Act, 1954,
all citizens of India whether male or female, irrespective of the faith they
professed, have the option to be governed by the provisions of the said Act,
instead  of  their  own  ‘personal  law’.   It  was  therefore  contended,  that
spouses belonging to a particular religious denomination, had the choice to
opt for a secular and non-religious law, namely, the Special Marriage Act,
1954, and such of the parties who accept the choice (even if they profess
171the  Muslim  religion),  would  automatically  escape  from  all  religious
practices, including ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was therefore contended, that such
of the couples who married in terms of their ‘personal law’, must be deemed
to have exercised their conscious option to be regulated by the ‘personal
law’,  under  which  they  were  married.   Having  exercised  the  aforesaid
option, it was submitted, that it was not open to a Muslim couple to then
plead, against the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was submitted, that when
parties consent to marry, their consent does not extend to the choice of the
person with reference to whom the consent is extended, but it also implicitly
extends to the law by which the matrimonial alliances are to be regulated.
If the consent is to marry in consonance with the ‘personal law’, then the
rigours of ‘personal law’ would regulate the procedure for dissolution of
marriage.   And  likewise,  if  the  consent  is  to  marry  under  the  Special
Marriage Act, 1954, the consent is to be governed by the provisions of the
aforesaid legislation.  In such a situation, it was submitted, that a person,
who had consciously opted for the matrimonial alliance under ‘personal law’
cannot  complain,  that  the  ‘personal  law’  was  unfavourable  or
discriminatory.  It was submitted, that in the above view of the matter, the
very filing of the instant petition before this Court, and the support of the
petitioner’s cause by those who have been impleaded, or had appeared to
represent the petitioner’s cause, must be deemed to be wholly misconceived
in law.
101.The second submission advanced at the hands of the learned senior
counsel, was that the issues raised by the petitioner with reference to the
172validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq were matters of legislative policy,
and  could  not  (though  learned  counsel  truly  meant  –  ought  not)  be
interfered with through the judicial process.  In this behalf, learned senior
counsel invited the Court’s attention to Maharshi Avadhesh v. Union of
India44, wherein the petitioner had approached this Court by filing a writ
petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, with the following prayers:
“(i) A writ of mandamus to the respondents to consider the question of
enacting a common civil code for all citizens of India.
(ii) To declare Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986
as void being arbitrary and discriminatory and in violation of Articles 14
and 15 and Articles 44, 38 39 and 39-A of the Constitution of India.
(iii) To direct the respondents not to enact Shariat Act in respect of those
adversely affecting the dignity and rights of Muslim women and against
their protection.”
It was pointed out, that this Court dismissed the above writ petition by
observing, “these are all matters for legislature.  The court cannot legislate
on these matters.”
102.Reliance was also placed on the Ahmedabad Women Action Group
case30.  It was submitted that this Court considered the following issues
during the course of adjudication of the above matter.
“(i) Whether Muslim Personal Law which allows Polygamy is void as
offending Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
(ii) Whether Muslim Personal Law which enables a Muslim male to give
unilateral Talaq to his wife without her consent and without resort to
judicial process of courts, is void as it offends Articles 13, 14 and 15 of
the Constitution.
(iii) Whether the mere fact that a Muslim husband takes more than one
wife is an act of cruelty.”
44
173103.It was pointed out, that having heard the above matter, the same
was dismissed by recording the following observations in paragraph 4 of the
judgment:
“At the outset, we would like to state that these writ petitions do not
deserve disposal on merits inasmuch as the arguments advanced by the
learned Senior Advocate before us wholly involve issues of State policies
with which the Court will not ordinarily have any concern.  Further, we
find that when similar attempts were made, of course by others, on
earlier occasions this Court held that the remedy lies somewhere else
and not by knocking at the doors of the courts.”
104.Having raised the two preliminary objections with reference to the
entertainment of the prayer made by the petitioner, learned counsel invited
the Court’s attention to abolition of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ in other
countries.  It was submitted, that (-for details, refer to Part-5 – Abrogation
of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by legislation, the world over, in Islamic, as
well as, non-Islamic States), the above contention was adopted both by the
petitioner, as well as, those who supported the petitioner’s cause, as also by
the Union of India, in order to contend, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’
has been done away with in other Islamic countries, as a matter of social
reform, on account of its being abhorrent, and also unilateral and arbitrary.
It was submitted, that the constitutional validity of ‘personal law’ in India,
cannot be tested on the basis of enacted legislations of other countries.  At
this juncture, learned senior counsel desired us to notice, that the instant
submission had been advanced without prejudice to the contention being
canvassed by him, that the validity of ‘personal law’ cannot be tested at all,
with reference to the fundamental rights vested in individuals under Part III
174of the Constitution, for the reason, that ‘personal law’ cannot be treated as
law within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution.
105.Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel, then endeavoured
to establish the validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.  It was submitted,
that out of the five schools of Sunni Muslims ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was considered
a valid form of divorce of four of the said schools.  It was submitted, that the
above position was accepted by the Delhi High Court in the Masroor Ahmed
case4, wherein in paragraph 26, the High Court observed “…..It is accepted
by  all  schools  of  law  that  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  is  sinful,  yet  some  schools
regarded it as valid…..”.  It has also been acknowledged by the High Courts
in different judgments rendered by them (-for details, refer  to Part-6 –
Judicial  pronouncements,  on   the  subject  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’).   It  was
accordingly sought to be inferred, that once it was established as a fact,
that certain schools of Shia Muslims believed ‘talaq-e-biddat’ to be a valid
form  of  divorce,  the  consequence  that  would  follow  would  be,  that
cohabitation  amongst  the  spouses  after  the  pronouncement  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ would be sinful, as per the injunction of the Quran, in ‘sura’
2, Al Baqara Ayah 230.  The same is reproduced hereunder:
“And if he has divorced her (for the third time), then she is not lawful to
him afterward until (after) she marries a husband other than him.  And if
the latter husband divorces her (or dies), there is no blame upon the
woman and her former husband for returning to each other if they think
that they can keep (within)the limits of Allah.  These are the limits of
Allah, which He makes clear to a people who know.”
It was pointed out, that the belief that after a husband has divorced his wife
by  pronouncing  talaq  thrice,  it  had  been  interfered  that  the  three
pronouncements should be treated as a singular pronouncement.  It was
175pointd  out,  that  High  Courts  have  no  such  jurisdiction  as  has  been
exercised by them on the subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was accordingly
asserted, that the above action constituted the creation of inroads into
‘personal law’ of Muslims, which stood protected under Article 25 of the
Constitution.  In this behalf, it was also submitted, that while deciding the
issue whether a belief or a practice constituted an integral part of religion,
this Court held, that the above question needed to be answered on the basis
of the views of the followers of the faith, and none else.  In order to support
his above submission, learned senior counsel, placed reliance on the Sardar
Syedna  Taher  Saifuddin  Saheb  case28,  wherein  this  Court  observed  as
under:
“The content of Articlles 25 and 26 of the Constitution came up for
consideration before this Court in the Commissioner, Hindu Religious
Endowments Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur
Matt;  Mahant  Jagannath  Ramanuj  Das  v.  The  State  of  Orissa;  Sri
Ventatamana Devaru v. The State of Mysore; Durgah Committee, Ajmer
v. Syed Hussain Ali and several other cases and  the main principles
underlying these provisions have by these decisions been placed beyond
controversy.  The first is that the protection of these articles is not
limited to matters of doctrine or belief they extend also to acts done in
pursuance of religion and therefore contain a guarantee for rituals and
observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts
of religion.  The second is that what constitutes an essential part of a
religious  or  religious  practice  has  to  be  decided  by  the  courts  with
reference to the doctrine of a particular religion and include practices
which are regarded by the community as a part of its religio n”.
It was pointed out, that the above view of this Court had been affirmed by
this  Court  in  N.  Adithyan  v.  Travancore  Devasom  Board45,  wherein  in
paragraphs 9 and 16, it was observed as under:
“9. This Court, in Seshammal v. State of T.N., (1972) 2 SCC 11 again
reviewed the principles underlying the protection engrafted in Articles 25
45
176and 26 in the context of a challenge made to abolition of hereditary right
of Archaka, and reiterated the position as hereunder : (SCC p.21, paras
13-14)
“13. This Court in Sardar Taher Saifuddin Saheb v. State of Bombay AIR
1962 SC 853 has summarized the position in law as follows (pp.531 and
532):
‘The content of Articles 25  and 26 of the Constitution  came  up  for
consideration before this Court in Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments
v.  Sri  Lakshmindra  Thirtha  Swamiar  of  Sri  Shirur  Mutt,  Mahant
Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. State of Orissa, Venkataramana Devaru v.
State of Mysore, Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali15 and
several other cases and the main principles underlying these provisions
have by these decisions been placed beyond controversy.  The first is that
the protection of these articles is not limited to matters of doctrine or
belief they extend also to acts done in pursuance of religion and therefore
contain a guarantee for rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes
of worship which are integral parts of religion.  The second is that what
constitutes an essential part of a religion or religious practice has to be
decided  by the  courts  with  reference  to  the  doctrine  of  a particular
religion and include practices which are regarded by the community as a
part of its religion .’
14.  Bearing  these  principles  in  mind,  we  have  to  approach  the
controversy in the present case.”
16.  It is now well settled that Article 25 secures to every person, subject
of course to public order, health and morality and other provisions of
Part III, including Article 17 freedom to entertain and exhibit by outward
acts as well as propagate and disseminate such religious belief according
to his judgment and conscience  for the edification of others.  The right of
the State to impose such restrictions as are desired or found necessary
on grounds of public order, health and morality is inbuilt in Articles 25
and 26 itself.  Article 25(2)(b) ensures the right of the State to make a law
providing for social welfare and reform besides throwing open of Hindu
religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of
Hindus and any such rights of the Sate or of the communities or classes
of society were also considered to need due regulation in the process of
harmonizing the various rights .  The vision of the founding fathers of the
Constitution to liberate the society from blind and ritualistic adherence
to mere traditional superstitious beliefs sans reason or rational basis has
found expression in the form of Article 17.  The legal position that the
protection under Articles 25 and 26 extends a guarantee for rituals and
observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts
of religion and as to what really constitutes an essential part of religion
or religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the
doctrine of a particular religion or practices regarded as parts of religion,
came to be equally firmly laid down .”
177In continuation of the above submission, learned senior counsel also placed
reliance on Sri Adi Visheshwara of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi v.
State of U.P.46, wherein this Court held as under:
“28…..All secular activities which may be associated with religion but
which do not relate or constitute an essential part of it may be amenable
to State regulations but what constitutes the essential part of religion
may be ascertained primarily from the doctrines of that religion itself
according to its tenets, historical background and change in evolved
process etc.  The concept of essentiality is not itself a determinative
factor.  It is one of the circumstances to be considered in adjudging
whether the particular matters of religion or religious practices or belief
are an integral part of the religion.  It must be decided whether the
practices or matters are considered integral by the community itself .
Though not conclusive, this is also one of the facets to be noticed.  The
practice in question is religious in character and whether it could be
regarded as an integral and essential part of the religion and if the court
finds upon evidence adduced before it that it is an integral or essential
part of the religion, Article 25 accords protection to it. …..”
It was the pointed contention of learned senior counsel, that the judgments
rendered by the High Courts on the subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ (-for details,
refer  to  Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’), were unsustainable in law, because the High Courts had
substituted  their  own  views  with  reference  to  their  understanding  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It was also pointed out, that supplanting of the views of
one  of  the  schools  on  the  beliefs  of  the  other  four  schools,  of  Sunni
Muslims,  with  reference  to  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  was  in  clear  breach  of  the
understanding of Muslims.
106.Learned senior counsel also disputed the reliance on International
Conventions by all those who had assisted this Court on behalf of the
petitioner.  In this behalf, it was pointed out, that reliance on International
46
178Conventions, particularly on CEDAW was wholly misplaced, since India had
expressed a clear reservation to the Conventions in order to support its
constitutional  policy  of  non-interference  in  the  personal  affairs  of  any
community.  In this behalf, while making a particular reference to CEDAW,
it was submitted, that the above declarations/reservations were first made
at the time of signing the aforesaid conventions and thereafter, even at the
time  of  ratification.   In  this  behalf,  it  was  pointed  out,  that  the  first
declaration was made by India in the following format:-
“i)  With  regard  to  articles  5(a)  and  16(1)  of  the  Convention  on  the
Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discimination  Against  Women,  the
Governmetn of the Republic of India declares that it shall abide by and
ensure these provisions in conformity with its policy of non-interefernece
in  the  personal  affairs  of  any  Community  without  its  initiative  and
consent.""
In view of the clear stance adopted at the time of signing the Convention, as
also, at the time of its ratification, it was submitted, that there could be no
doubt, that India had itself committed that it would not interfere with
personal affairs of any community, without the initiative and consent of the
concerned community.  It was submitted, that the aforesaid commitment
could not be ignored by the Union of India.  While addressing this Court on
the issue under reference, it was submitted, that the position adopted by
the Union of India, was in clear derogation of the stance adopted on behalf
of the India, as has been detailed above. 
107.Learned  senior  counsel  also  seriously disputed  the  submissions
advanced  at  the  hands  of  the  petitioners  based  on  repudiation  of  the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ in various secular countries with Muslims in the
majority, as also, theocratic States, through express legislation on the issue
179(-for details, refer to Part-5 – Abrogation of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by
legislation, the world over, in Islamic, as well as, non-Islamic States).  In
this behalf, it was submitted, that ‘personal law’ of classes and sections of
the society and/or of religious denominations are sought to be protected by
the Constitution by raising them to the high position of fundamental rights.
It was accordingly asserted, that what was available to such classes and
sections of society, as also, to the religious denominations as a matter of
fundamental right under the Constitution, could not be negated, because
other  countries  had  enacted  legislations  for  such  annulment.   Further
more, it was submitted, that legislation is based on the collective will of the
residents of a particular country, and as such, the will of the residents of a
foreign country, cannot be thrust upon the will of the residents in India.
While adopting the position canvassed on behalf of learned senior counsel
who  had  preceded  him,  it  was  pointed  out,  that  it  was  open  to  the
legislature in India, to likewise provide for such legislation, because entry 5
of the Concurrent List contained in the Seventh Schedule allows legislation
even with reference to matters governed by ‘personal law’.  Additionally, it
was submitted, that provision in this behalf was available in Article 25(2)(b),
which provides that for espousing the cause of social welfare and reform it
was open to the legislature even to legislate on matters governed under
‘personal  law’.   It  was  therefore  contended  that  all  such  submissions
advanced on behalf of the petitioners need to be ignored.
108.Mr.  V.  Giri,  Senior  Advocate,  entered  appearance  on  behalf  of
Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind (represented by its General Secretary, 1 Bahadur
180Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi) – respondent no.7 in Suo Motu Writ Petition
(Civil) No.2 of 2015 and respondent no.6 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 118 of
2016.  It would be relevant to mention, at the outset, that learned senior
counsel endorsed the submissions advanced by Mr. Kapil Sibal and Mr.
Raju Ramachandra, Senior Advocates, who had assisted this Court before
him.   Learned  senior  counsel  focused  his  contentions,  firstly  to  the
challenge raised to the validity of Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law
(Shariat) Application Act, 1937, insofar as, it relates to ‘talaq-e-biddat’ on
the  ground,  that  the  same  being  unconstitutional,  was  unenforceable.
Learned senior counsel, in order to raise his challenge, first and foremost,
drew our attention to Sections 2 and 3 of the Muslim Personal Law  (Shariat)
Application Act, 1937 (-for details, refer to Part-4 – Legislation in India, in
the  field  of  Muslim  ‘personal  law’).   It  was  submitted,  that  Section  2
aforesaid, commenced with a non obstante clause.  It was pointed out, that
the aforesaid non obstante clause was referable only to amplify the exclusion
of such customs and usages, as were contrary to Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’.  It was submitted, that reference was pointedly made only to such
customs and usages as were not in consonance with the Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was asserted, that the mandate of Section 2 was aimed at
making Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ as “the rule of decision”, even
when customs and usages were to the contrary.   It was sought to be
explained,  that  the  Shariat  Act  neither  defined  nor  expounded,  the
parameters of the same, with reference to subjects to which Sections 2 and
3 were made applicable.  It was therefore submitted, that the enactment
181under reference did not introduce Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, as the
same was the law applicable to the Muslims even prior to the enactment of
the said legislation.  In this behalf, it was pointed out, that in different parts
of the country customs and usages were being applied even with reference
to the Muslims overriding their ‘personal law’.  In order to substantiate the
above contention learned senior counsel made a pointed reference to the
statement of objects and reasons of the above enactment, which would
reveal that Muslims of British India had persistently urged that customary
law  and  usages  should  not  take  the  place  of  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –
‘Shariat’.  It was also pointed out, that the statement of objects and reasons
also  highlight  that  his  client,  namely,  Jamiat-ul-Ulema-i-Hind  had
supported the demand of the applicability of the Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’, for adjudication of disputes amonst Muslims, and had urged, that
custom and usage to the contrary, should not have an overriding effect.  It
was pointed out, that this could be done only because Muslim ‘personal law’
– ‘Shariat’ was in existence and was inapplicable to the adjudication of
disputes amongst Muslims, even prior to the above enactment in 1937.
Understood  in  the  aforesaid  manner,  it  was  submitted,  that  Muslim
‘personal law’ as a body of law, was only perpetuated, by the Shariat Act.  It
was submitted, that the Muslim ‘personal law’ had not been subsumed by
the statute nor had the 1937 Act codified the Muslim ‘personal law’.  It was
submitted, that the 1937 legislation was only statutorily declared that the
Muslim ‘personal law’, as a set of rules, would govern the Muslims in India,
and  that,  it  would  be  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  that  would  have  an
182overriding effect over any custom or usage to the contrary.  It was therefore
reiterated, that the legislature which enacted the Muslim Personal Law
(Shariat) Application Act, 1937, neither modified nor amended even in a
small measure, the Muslim ‘personal law’ applicable to the Muslims in
India,  nor  did  the  legislature  while  enacting  the  above  enactment,
subsumed the Muslim ‘personal law’, and therefore, the character of the
Muslim  ‘personal  law’  did  not  undergo  a  change  on  account  of  the
enactment of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.
According to learned senior counsel, the Muslim ‘personal law’ did not
metamorphized  into  a  statute,  and  as  such,  the  rights  and  duties  of
Muslims in India continued to be governed even after the enactment of the
Shariat Act, as before.  It was pointed out, that the Shariat Act did not
substitute, nor did it provide for any different set of rights and obligations
other than those which were recognized and prevalent as Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’.  As such, it was contended, that it was wholly unjustified to
assume, that Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ was given statutory effect,
through the Shariat Act.  It was therefore submitted that a challenge to the
validity of Section 2 of the above enactment, so as to assail the validity of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ as being contrary to the fundamental rights contained in
Part III of the Constitution, was an exercise in futility.  Insofar as the
instant  assertion  is  concerned,  learned  senior  counsel  advanced  two
submissions – firstly, that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)
Application Act, 1937 did not by itself bring about any law providing for
rights and obligations to be asserted and discharged by the Muslims as a
183community, for the simple reason, that it only reaffirmed the perpetuieties
of  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’,  and  as  such,  the  rights  and
obligations of persons which were subjected to Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’, continued as they existed prior to the enactment of the Shariat
Act.   And  secondly,  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’,  was  neither
transformed  nor  metamorphized  by  the  Shariat  Act,  in  the  nature  of
crystalised rules and regulations, and as such, even if Section 2 of the
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was struck down, the
same would automatically revive the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, in
view  of  the  mandate  contained  in  Article  25  of  the  Constitution.
Accordingly, it was pointed out, that the parameters of challenge, as were
applicable to assail a statutory enactment, would not be applicable in the
matter of assailing the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was also the
contention  of  learned  senior  counsel,  that  under  Article  25(1)  of  the
Constitution the right  to freely profess, practice and propagate religion, was
a universal right, guaranteed to every person, to act in affirmation of his
own faith.  It was submitted, that the above ambit was the core of the
secular nature of the Indian Constitution.  It was accordingly pointed out,
that  the  confines  of  the  rights  protected  under  Article  25(1),  could  be
assailed on limited grounds of public order, morality and health, and also if,
the provisions of Part III – Fundamental Rights, of the Constitution were
breached.
109.It was submitted, that a breach of the provisions contained in  Part
III – Fundamental Rights under the Constitution, could only be invoked
184with reference to a State action, as only State action has to conform to
Articles 14, 15 and 21.  It was therefore submitted, that a facial subjugation
of the right under Article 25(1) to the other provisons of the Constitution
would be inapplicable in the case of ‘personal law’, that has no source to
any statute, or State action.  It was submitted, that the Shariat Act  affirms
the applicability of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ and perpetuates it by
virtue of Section 2 thereof.  And therefore, it would not give the Muslim
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ a statutory flavour.
110.It was also submitted, that Sunnis were a religious denomination
within the meaning of Article 25 of the Constitution, and therefore, were
subject to public policy, morality and health.  Sunni Muslims, therefore had
a right inter alia to manage their own affairs in matters relating to religion.
It was pointed out, that it could not be gainsaid, that marriage and divorce
were matters of religion.  Therefore, Sunnis as a religious denomination,
were  entitled  to  manage  their  own  affairs  in  matters  of  marriage  and
divorce, which are in consonance with the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.
It was therefore submitted, that the provisions relating to marriage and
divorce, as were contained in the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, were
entitled to be protected as a denominational right, under Article 25 of the
Constitution.
111.Mr. V. Shekhar, Mr. Somya Chakravarti, Senior Advocates, Mr.Ajit
Wagh,  Ajmal  Khan,  Senior  Advocate,  Mr.  V.K.  Biju,  Mr.  Banerjee,  Mr.
Ashwani Upadhyay, Mr.Vivek C. Solsha, Ms. Rukhsana, Ms. Farah Faiz,
Advocates also assisted the Court.  Their assistance to the Court, was on
185issues canvassed by other learned counsel who had appeared before them.
The submissions advanced by them, have already been recorded above.  For
reasons of brevity, it is not necessary for us to record the same submission
once again, in the names of learned counsel referred to above.  All that
needs to be mentioned is, that we have taken due notice of the nuances
pointed out, and their emphasis on different aspects of the controversy.
Part-9.
Consideration of the rival contentions, and our conclusions:
112.During  the  course  of  our  consideration,  we  will  endeavour  to
examine a series of complicated issues. We will need to determine, the legal
sanctity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.  This will enable us to ascertain,
whether the practice of talaq has a legislative sanction, because it is the
petitioner’s  case,  that  it is  so  through  express  legislation  (-the  Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937).  But the stance adopted on
behalf of those contesting the petitioner’s claim is, that its stature is that of
‘personal law’, and on that account, the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ has a
constitutional protection.
113.Having concluded one way or the other, we will need to determine
whether divorce by way of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq, falls foul of Part III –
Fundamental  Rights  of  the  Constitution  (this  determination  would  be
subject to, the acceptance of the petitioner’s contention, that the practice
has statutory sanction).  However, if We conclude to the contrary, namely,
that the ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq, has the stature of ‘personal law’, We
will have to determine the binding effect of the practice, and whether it can
186be interfered with on the judicial side by this Court.  The instant course
would be necessary, in view of the mandate contained in Article 25 of the
Constitution, which has been relied upon by those who are opposing the
petitioner’s cause.  
114.Even if we agree with the proposition that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple
talaq constitutes the ‘personal law’ governing Muslims, on the issue of
divorce,  this  Court  will  still  need  to  examine,  whether  the  practice  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq, violates the acceptable norms of “… public
order, morality and health and to the other provisions …” of Part III of the
Constitution (–for that, is the case set up by the petitioner). Even if the
conclusions after the debate travelling the course narrated in the foregoing
paragraph does not lead to any fruitful results for the petitioner’s cause, it
is their case, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ being socially repulsive
should be declared as being violative of  constitutional morality – a concept
invoked by this Court, according to the petitioner, to interfere with on the
ground that it would serve a cause in larger public interest. The petitioners’
cause, in the instant context is supported by the abrogation of the practice
of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  the  world  over  in  countries  with  sizeable  Muslim
populations including theocratic Islamic States. The following examination,
shall traverse the course recorded herein above.
I.  Does the judgment of the Privy Council in the Rashid Ahmad case,
upholding ‘talaq-e-biddat’, require a relook ?
115.It would not be necessary for this debate – about the validity of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ under the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, to be prolonged
or complicated, if the decision rendered by the Privy Council, in the Rashid
187Ahmad case1 is to be considered as the final word on its validity, as also, on
the irrevocable nature of divorce, by way of ‘talaq-e-biddat’. The debate
would end forthwith.  The aforesaid judgment was rendered by applying the
Muslim ‘personal law’.  In the above judgment, ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was held as
valid and binding.  The pronouncement in the Rashid Ahmad case1 is of
extreme significance, because Anisa Khatun – the erstwhile wife and her
former husband Ghyas-ud-din had continued to cohabit and live together
with her husband, for a period of fifteen years, after the pronouncement of
‘talaq-e-biddat’.  During this post divorce cohabitation, five children were
born to Anisa Khatun, through Ghiyas-ud-din.  And yet, the Privy Council
held,  that  the  marital  relationship  between  the  parties  had  ceased
forthwith, on the pronouncement of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.  The Privy
Council also held, that the five children born to Anisa Khatun, could not be
considered as the legitimate children of Ghyas-ud-din, and his erstwhile
wife.  The children born to Anisa Khatun after the parties stood divorced,
were therefore held as disentitled to inherit the property of Ghyas-ud-din.
The judgment in the Rashid Ahmad case1 was rendered in 1932.  The
asserted statutory status of Muslim ‘personal law’ (as has been canvassed
by the petitioners), emerged from the enactment of the Muslim Personal
Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.  The ‘Shariat’ Act expressly provided,
that the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, would constitute “the rule of
decision”, in causes where the parties were Muslim.  It is not in dispute,
that besides other subjects, consequent upon the enactment of the Shariat
Act, dissolution of marriage amongst Muslims, by way of ‘talaq’, would also
188have to be in consonance with the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  As
noticed herein above,  ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is one of the forms of dissolution of
marriage by ‘talaq’, amongst Muslims.  According to the petitioners case,
the issue needed a fresh look, of the conferment of statutoty status to
Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’.   It  was  submitted,  that  after  having
acquired  statutory  status,  the  questions  and  subjects  (including
‘talaq-e-biddat’), would have to be in conformity (-and not in conflict), with
the  provisions  of  Part  III  –  Fundamental  Rights,  of  the  Constitution.
Needless to mention, that all these are important legal questions, requiring
examination.
116.In our considered view, the matter would most certainly also require
a fresh look, because various High Courts, having examined the practice of
divorce amongst Muslims, by way of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, have arrived at the
conclusion, that the judgment in the Rashid Ahmad case1 was rendered on
an incorrect understanding, of the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’. 
117.If the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, had
incorporated the manner in which questions regarding intestate succession,
special  property  of  females  including  personal  property  inherited  or
obtained under contract or gift or matters such as marriage, dissolution of
marriage,  including  talaq,  ila,  jihar,  lian,  khula  and  mubaraat,
maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and trust properties, and
wakfs  (-as  in  Section  2  thereof),  had  to  be  dealt  with,  as  per  Muslim
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ according to the petitioners, it would be quite a
different matter.  All the same, the Shariat Act did not describe how the
189above questions and subjects had to be dealt with.  And therefore, for
settlement  of  disputes  amongst  Muslims,  it  would  need  to  be  first
determined,  what  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’,  with  reference  to  the
disputation, was.  Whatever it was, would in terms of Section 2 of the 1937
Act, constitute “the rule of decision”.  After the Privy Council had rendered
the  judgment  in  the  Rashid  Ahmad  case1,  and  well  after  the  asserted
statutory status came to be conferred on Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’,
the issue came up for consideration before the Kerala High Court in A.
Yusuf  Rawther  v.  Sowramma47,  wherein,  the  High  Court  examined  the
above  decision  of  the  Privy  Council  in  the  Rashid  Ahmad  case1,  and
expressed, that the views of the British Courts on Muslim ‘personal law’,
were  based  on  an  incorrect  understanding  of  ‘Shariat’.   In  the  above
judgment, a learned Single Judge (Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, as he then
was) of the Kerala High Court, recorded the following observations:
“7. There has been considerable argument at the bar – and precedents
have been piled up by each side – as to the meaning to be given to the
expression ‘failed to provide for her maintenance’ and about the grounds
recognised as valid for dissolution under Muslim law.  Since infallibility
is  not an  attribute  of  the  judiciary,  the  view  has  been  ventured  by
Muslim jurists that the Indo-Anglian judicial exposition of the Islamic
law of divorce has not exactly been just to the Holy Prophet or the Holy
Book.  Marginal distortions are inevitable when the Judicial Committee
in Downing Street has to interpret Manu and Muhammad of India and
Arabia.   The  soul  of  a  culture  –  law  is  largely  the  formalized  and
enforceable expression of a community’s cultural norms – cannot be fully
understood by alien minds.  The view that the Muslim husband enjoys
an arbitrary, unilateral power to inflict instant divorce does not accord
with Islamic injunctions ….   It is a popular fallacy that a Muslim male
enjoys, under the Quaranic law, unbridled authority to liquidate the
marriage.  “The whole Quoran expressly forbids a man to seek pretexts
for divorcing his wife, so long as she remains faithful and obedient to
him, “if they (namely, women) obey you, then do not seek a way against
47
190them”.”  (Quaran IV:34).  The Islamic “law gives to the man primarily the
faculty of dissolving the marriage, if the wife, by her indocility or her bad
character,  renders  the  married  life  unhappy;  but  in  the  absence  of
serious reasons, no man can justify a divorce, either in the eye of religion
or the law.  If he abandons his wife or puts her away in simple caprice,
he draws upon himself the divine anger, for the curse of God, said the
Prophet, rests on him who repudiates his wife capriciously.”   As the
learned author, Ahmad A. Galwash notices, the pagan Arab, before the
time of the Prophet, was absolutely free to repudiate his wife whenever it
suited his whim, but when the Prophet came He declared divorce to he
“the most disliked of lawful things in the sight of God.  He was indeed
never tired of expressing his abhorrence of divorce.  Once he said: ‘God
created not anything on the face of the earth which He loveth more than
the act of manumission.  (of slaves) nor did He create anything on the
face of the earth which he detesteth  more than the act of divorce”.
Commentators on the Quoran have rightly observed – and this tallies
with the law now administered in some Mulsim countries like Iraq – that
the  husband  must  satisfy  the  court  about  the  reasons  for  divorce.
However, Muslim law, as applied in India, has taken a course contrary to
the spirit of what the Prophet or the Holy Quoran laid down and the
same  misconception  vitiates  the  law  dealing  with  the  wife’s  right  to
divorce.” 
118.Without  pointedly  examining  the  issue  of  the  validity  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, under the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, this Court in
Fuzlunbi v. K. Khader Vali48, recorded the following observations:
“20.  Before we bid farewell to Fazlunbi it is necessary to mention that
Chief  Justice  Baharul  Islam,  in  an  elaborate  judgment  replete  with
quotes from the Holy Quoran, has exposed the error of early English
authors and judges who dealt with talaq in Muslim Law as good even if
pronounced at whim or in tantrum, and argued against the diehard view
of Batchelor J. ILR 30 Bom 539 that this view ‘is good in law, though bad
in theology’.  Maybe, when the point directly arises, the question will
have to be considered by this court, but enough unto the day the evil
thereof and we do not express our opinion on this question as it does not
call for a decision in the present case .”
The above observations lead to the inference, that the proposition of law
pronounced by the Privy Council in the Rashid Ahmad case1, needed a
relook.  
48
191119.It  would  be  relevant  to  mention,  that  in  the  interregnum,  the
validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was considered by a learned Single Judge (Justice
Baharul Islam, as he then was) of the Gauhati High Court, in the Jiauddin
Ahmed case2, wherein, the High Court took a view different from the one
recorded by the Privy Council (-in the Rashid Ahmad case1).  In doing so, it
relied on ‘hadiths’, ‘ijma’ and ‘qiyas’.  The issue was again examined, by a
Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court, in the Mst. Rukia Khatun case3.
Yet again, the High Court (speaking through, Chief Justice Baharul Islam,
as he then was), did not concur with the view propounded by the Privy
Council.  The matter was also examined by a Single Judge (Justice Badar
Durrez Ahmed, as he then was) of the Delhi High Court in the Masroor
Ahmed case4.  Herein again, by placing reliance on relevant ‘hadiths’, the
Delhi High Court came to the conclusion, that the legal position expressed
by the Privy Council on ‘talaq-e-biddat’, was not in consonance with the
Muslim  ‘personal  law’.   The  Kerala  High  Court,  in  the  Nazeer  case5
(authored  by,  Justice  A.  Muhamed  Mustaque)  highlighted  the  woeful
condition of Muslim wives, because of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, and
recorded its views on the matter.
120.In  view  of  the  position  expressed  hereinabove,  we  are  of  the
considered  view,  that  the  opinion  expressed  by  the  Privy  Council  with
reference  to  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  in  the  Rashid  Ahmad  case1,  holding  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’ results in finally and irrevocably severing the matrimonial
tie  between  spouses,  the  very  moment  it  is  pronounced,  needs  to  be
examined afresh.  More particularly, because the validity of the same as an
192approved concept, of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, was not evaluated at
that juncture (-as it indeed could not have been, as the legislation was not
available,  when  the  Privy  Council  had  rendered  its  judgment),  in  the
backdrop of the Shariat Act,  and also, the provisions of the Constitution of
India.
II.  Has ‘talaq-e-biddat’, which is concededly sinful, sanction of law ? 
121.The petitioners, and others who support the petitoner’s cause, have
vehemently contended, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’, does not have its source of
origin  from  the  Quran.  The  submission  does  not  need  a  serious
examination, because even ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ which the
petitioners acknowledge as – ‘the most proper’, and – ‘the proper’ forms of
divorce respectively, also do not find mention in the Quran.  Despite the
absence  of  any  reference  to  ‘talaq-e-ahsan’  and  ‘talaq-e-hasan’  in  the
Quran, none of the petitioners has raised any challenge thereto, on this
score.  A challenge to ‘talaq-e-biddat’ obviously cannot be raised on this
ground. We are satisfied, that the different approved  practices of talaq
among Muslims, have their origin in ‘hadiths’ and other sources of Muslim
jurisprudence.  And therefore, merely because it is not expressly provided
for or approved by the Quran, cannot be a valid justification for setting
aside the practice.
122.The petitioners actually call for a simple and summary disposal of
the controversy, by requiring us to hold, that whatever is irregular and
sinful, cannot have the sanction of law.  The above prayer is supported by
contending, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is proclaimed as bad in theology.  It was
193submitted, that this practice is clearly patriarchal, and therefore, cannot be
sustained in today’s world of gender equality.  In order to persuade this
Court,  to  accept  the  petitioners’  prayer  –  to  declare  the  practice  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ as unacceptable in law, the Court’s attention was invited to
the fact, that the present controversy needed a similar intervention, as had
been adopted for doing away with similar patriarchal, irregular and sinful
practices  amongst  Hindus.   In  this  behalf,  reference  was  made  to  the
practices of ‘Sati’, ‘Devadasi’ and ‘Polygamy’.
123(i). We may only highlight, that ‘Sati’ was commonly described as –
widow burning. The practice required a widow to immolate herself, on her
husband’s  pyre  (or  alternatively,  to  commit  suicide  shortly  after  her
husband’s death).  ‘Sati’ just like ‘talaq-e-biddat’, had been in vogue since
time immemorial.  It is believed, that the practice of ‘Sati’ relates back to the
1st century B.C..  On the Indian sub-continent, it is stated to have gained
popularity from the 10th century A.D.  The submission was, that just as
‘Sati’ had been declared as unacceptable, the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’
should likewise be declared as unacceptable in law.  
(ii) ‘Devadasi’ translated literally means, a girl dedicated to the worship
and  service  of  a  diety  or  temple.   The  surrender  and  service  of  the
‘Devadasi’, in terms of the practice, was for life.  This practice had also been
in vogue since time immorial, even though originally ‘Devadasis’ had a high
status in society, because the Rulers/Kings of the time, were patrons of
temples.  During British rule in India, the Rulers backing and support to
temples, waned off.  It is believed, that after funds from the Rulers stopped,
194to sustain themselves ‘Devadasis’ used dancing and singing as a means of
livelihood.  They also commenced to indulge in prostitution.  The life of the
‘Devadasi’,  thereupon  came  into  disrepute,  and  resulted  in  a  life  of
destitution.  The practice had another malady, tradition forbade a ‘Devadasi’
from marrying.  
(iii) So far as ‘polygamy’ is concerned, we are of the view that polygamy
is well understood, and needs no elaboration.
124.We are of the view, that the practices referred to by the petitioners,
to support their claim, need a further examination, to understand how the
practices were discontinued.  We shall now record details, of how these
practices, were abolished:  
(i)Insofar as the practice of ‘Sati’ is concerned, its practice reached
alarming proportion between 1815-1818, it is estimated that the incidence
of ‘Sati’ doubled during this period.  A campaign to abolish ‘Sati’  was
initiated by Christian missionaries (- like, William Carey), and by Hindu
Brahmins (-like, Ram Mohan Roy).  The provincial Government of Bengal
banned ‘Sati’ in 1829, by way of legislation.  This was then followed by
similar laws by princely States in India.  After the practice was barred by
law, the Indian Sati Prevention Act, 1988 was enacted, which crimnalised
any type of aiding, abetting or glorifying the practice of ‘Sati’.  
(ii)Insofar as the practice of ‘Devadasi’ is concerned, soon after the end
of British rule, independent India passed the Madras Devadasi’s (Prevention
of Dedication) Act (-also called the Tamil Nadu Devadasis (Prevention of
Dedication Act) on 09.10.1947.  The enactment made prostitution illegal.
195The  other  legislations  enacted  on  the  same  issue,  included  the  1934
Bombay Devadasi Protection Act, the 1957 Bombay Protection (Extension)
Act, and the Andhra Pradesh Devadasi (Prohibition of Dedication) Act of
1988.  It is therefore apparent, that the instant practice was done away
with, through legislation.
(iii)The last of the sinful practices brought to our notice was ‘polygamy’.
Polygamy was permitted amongst Hindus.  In 1860, the Indian Penal Code
made ‘polygamy’ a criminal offence.  The Hindu Mariage Act was passed in
1955.  Section 5 thereof provides, the conditions for a valid Hindu marriage.
One of the conditions postulated therein was, that neither of the parties to
the matrimonial alliance should have a living spouse, at the time of the
marriage.  It is therefore apparent, that the practice of polygamy was not
only  done  away  with  amongst  Hindus,  but  the  same  was  also  made
punishable as a criminal offence.  This also happened by legislation.
125.The factual and the legal position noticed in the foregoing paragraph
clearly brings out, that the practices of ‘Sati’, ‘Devadasi’ and ‘polygamy’ were
abhorrent,  and  could  well  be  described  as  sinful.   They  were  clearly
undesirable and surely bad in theology.  It is however important to notice,
that neither of those practices came to be challenged before any court of
law.  Each of the practices to which our pointed attention was drawn, came
to be discontinued and invalidated by way of legislative enactments.  The
instances cited on behalf of the petitioners cannot therefore be of much
avail,  with  reference to  the matter  in  hand, wherein,  the prayer  is for
judicial intervention. 
196126.We would now venture to attempt an answer to the simple prayer
made on behalf of the petitioners, for a summary disposal of the petitioner’s
cause, namely, for declaring the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, as unacceptable
in law.  In support of the instant prayer, it was submitted, that it could not
be imagined, that any religious practice, which was considered as a sin, by
the believers of that very faith, could be considered as enforceable in law.  It
was asserted, that what was sinful could not be religious.  It was also
contended, that merely because a sinful practice had prevailed over a long
duration of time, it could best be considered as a form of custom or usage,
and not a matter of any binding faith. (This submission, is being dealt with
in part IV, immediately hereinafter).  It was submitted, that no court should
find any difficulty, in declaring a custom or usage – which is sinful, as
unacceptable in law. It was also the pointed assertion on behalf of the
petitioners, that what was sacrilegious could not ever be a part of Muslim
‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’.  The  manner  in  which  one  learned  counsel
expressed  the  proposition,  during  the  course  of  hearing,  was  very
interesting.  We may therefore record the submission exactly in the manner
it was projected.  Learned counsel for evoking and arousing the Bench’s
conscience submitted, “if something is sinful or abhorrent in the eyes of
God, can any law by man validate it”.  It seems to us, that the suggestion
was, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ did not flow out of any religious foundation, and
therefore, the practice need not be considered as religious at all.  One of the
non-professional  individuals  assisting  this  Court  on  behalf  of  the
petitioners’, went to the extent of stating, that the fear of the fact, that the
197wife could be thrown out of the matrimonial house, at any time, was like a
sword hanging over the matrimonial alliance, during the entire duration of
the marriage.  It was submitted, that the fear of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, was a
matter of continuous mental torture, for the female spouse.  We were told,
that the extent of the practice being abhorrent, can be visualized from the
aforesaid,  position.   It was  submitted,  that  the  practice  was  extremely
self-effacing,  and  continued  to  be  a  cause  of  insecurity,  for  the  entire
duration of the matrimonial life.  It was pointed out, that this practice
violated the pious and noble prescripts of the Quran.  It was highlighted,
that  even  those  who  had  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  respondents,  had
acknowledged,  that  the  practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  was  described  as
irregular and sinful, even amongst Muslims.  It was accordingly asserted,
that it was accepted by one and all, that the practice was bad in theology. It
was  also  acknowledged,  that  it  had  no  place  in  modern  day  society.
Learned counsel  therefore suggested, that triple talaq should be simply
declared as unacceptable in law, and should be finally done away with.  
127.A simple issue, would obviously have a simple answer.  Irespective
of what has been stated by the learned counsel for the rival parties, there
can be no dispute on two issues.  Firstly, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’
has been in vogue since the period of Umar, which is roughly more than
1400 years ago.  Secondly, that each one of learned counsel, irrespective of
who they represented, (-the petitioners or the respondents), acknowledged
in one voice, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ though bad in theology, was considered as
“good” in law.  All learned counsel representing the petitioners were also
198unequivocal, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was accepted as a “valid” practice in law.
That being so, it is not possible for us to hold, the practice to be invalid in
law, merely at the asking of the petitioners, just because it is considered
bad in theology.
III. Is the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, approved/disapproved by “hadiths”? 
128.At  the  beginning  of  our  consideration,  we  have  arrived  at  the
conclusion, that the judgment rendered by the Privy Council in the Rashid
Ahmad  case1, needs a reconsideration, in view of the pronouncements of
various High Courts including a Single Judge of the Gauhati High Court in
the Jiauddin Ahmed case2, a Division Bench of the same High Court – the
Gauhati High Court in the Rukia Khatun case3,  by a Single Judge of the
Delhi High Court in the Masroor Ahmed case4, and finally, on account of the
decision of a Single Judge of the Kerala High Court in the Nazeer case5.  
129.Even though inconsequential, and the same can never – never be
treated as a relevant consideration, it needs to be highlighted, that each one
of the Judges who authored the judgments rendered by the High Courts
referred to above, professed the Muslim religion.  They were Sunni Muslims,
belonging  to  the  Hanafi  school.   The  understanding  by  them,  of  their
religion, cannot therefore be considered as an outsider’s view.  In the four
judgments referred to above, the High Courts relied on ‘hadiths’ to support
and supplement the eventual conclusion drawn.  There is certainly no room
for any doubt, that if ‘hadiths’ relied upon by the High Courts in their
respective judgments, validly affirmed the position expressed with reference
to ‘talaq-e-biddat’, there would be no occasion for us to record a view to the
199contrary.  It is in the aforestated background, that we proceed to examine
the ‘hadiths’ relied upon by learned counsel appearing for the rival parties,
to support their individual claims.
130.A number of learned counsel who had appeared in support of the
petitioners’ claim, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was un-Islamic, and
that this Court needed to pronounce it as such, invited our attention to a
set of ‘hadiths’, to substantiate their position.  The assertions made on
behalf of the petitioners were opposed, by placing reliance on a different set
of ‘hadiths’.  Based thereon, we will endeavour to record a firm conclusion,
whether  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  was  or  was  not,  recognized  and  supported  by
‘hadiths’.
131.First of all, we may refer to the submissions advanced by Mr. Amit
Singh  Chadha,  Senior  Advocate,  who  had  painstakingly referred  to  the
‘hadiths’ in the four judgments of the High Courts (-for details, refer to
Part-6  –  Judicial  pronouncements,  on  the  subject  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’).
Insofar as the Jiauddin Ahmed case2 is concerned, details of the entire
consideration have been narrated in paragraph 31 hereinabove.  Likewise,
the  consideration  with  reference  to  the  Rukia  Khatun  case3 has  been
recorded in paragraph 32.  The judgment in the Masroor Ahmed case4 has
been dealt with in paragraph 33.  And finally, the Nazeer case5 has been
deciphered,  by  incorporating  the  challenge,  the  consideration  and  the
conclusion in paragraph 34 hereinabove.  For reasons of brevity, it is not
necessary to record all the above ‘hadiths’ for the second time.  Referefence
may therefore be made to the paragraphs referred to above, as the first
200basis expressed on behalf of the petitioners, to lay the foundation of their
claim, that the practice, of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ cannot be accepted as a matter of
‘personal law’ amongst Muslims, including Sunni Muslims belonging to the
Hanafi school.  In fact, learned senior counsel, asserted, that the position
expressed by the High Courts, had been approved by this Court in the
Shamim Ara case12.
132.Mr. Anand Grover, Senior Advocate, reiterated and reaffirmed the
position expressed in the four judgments (two of the Gauhati High Court,
one of the Delhi High Court, and the last one of the Kerala High Court) to
emphasize his submissions, as a complete justification for accepting the
claims of the petitioners.  Interestingly, learned senior counsel made a
frontal attack to the ‘hadiths’ relied upon by the AIMPLB.  To repudiate the
veracity of the ‘hadiths’ relied upon by the respondents, it was pointed out,
that it was by now settled, that there were various degrees of reliability
and/or authenticity of different ‘hadiths’.  Referring to the Principles of
Mohomedan Law by Sir Dinshaw Fardunji Mulla (LexisNexis, Butterworths
Wadhwa, Nagpur, 20th edition), it was asserted, that the ‘hadiths’ relied
upon by the AIMPLB (to which a reference will be made separately), were far
– far removed from the time of the Prophet Mohammad.  It was explained,
that  ‘hadiths’  recorded  later  in  point  of  time,  were  less  credible  and
authentic,  as with the passage of time, distortions were likely to set in,
making them unreliable.  It was asserted, that ‘hadiths’ relied upon in the
four  judgments  rendered  by  the  High  Courts,  were  the  truly  reliable
‘hadiths’, as they did not suffer from the infirmity expressed above.  In
201addition to the above, learned senior counsel drew our attention, to Sunan
Bayhaqi 7/547 referred to on behalf of the AIMPLB, so as to point out, that
the same was far removed from the time of Prophet Mohammad.  As against
the above, it was submitted, that the ‘hadiths’ of Bhukahri (published by
Darussalam, Saudi Arabia), also relied upon by the AIMPLB, were obvious
examples  of  a  clear  distortion.   Moreover,  it  was  submitted,  that  the
‘hadiths’, relied upon by the AIMPLB were not found in the Al Bukhari
Hadiths. It was therefore submitted, that reliance on the ‘hadiths’ other
than those noticed in the individual judgments referred to hereinabove,
would be unsafe (-for details, refer to paragraph 42).  
133.Learned senior counsel also asserted, that as a historical fact Shia
Muslims believe, that during the Prophet’s time, and that of the First Caliph
– Abu Baqhr, and the Second Caliph – Umar, pronouncements of talaq by
three consecutive utterances were treated as one.  (Reference in this behalf
was made to “Sahih Muslim” compiled by Al-Hafiz Zakiuddin Abdul-Azim
Al-Mundhiri, and published by Darussalam).   Learned senior counsel also
placed reliance on “The lawful and the prohibited in Islam” by Al-Halal Wal
Haram Fil Islam (edition – August 2009).  It was pointed out, that the
instant transcript was of Egyptian origin, and further emphasized, that the
same therefore needed to be accepted as genuine and applicable to the
dispute,  because  Egypt  was  primarily  dominated  by  Sunni  Muslims
belonging to the Hanafi school.  In the above publication, it was submitted,
that the practice of instant triple talaq was described as sinful. Reference
was then made to “Woman in Islamic Shariah” by Maulana Wahiduddin
202Khan  (published  by  Goodword  Books,  reprinted  in  2014),  wherein,
irrespective of the number of times the word ‘talaq’ was pronounced (if
pronounced at the same time, and on the same occasion), was treated as a
singular pronouncement of talaq, in terms of the ‘hadith’ of Imam Abu
Dawud in Fath al-bari 9/27.   It was submitted, that the aforesaid ‘hadith’
had rightfully been taken into consideration by the Delhi High Court in the
Masroor Ahmed case4.  In addition to the above, reference was made to
“Marriage  and  family  life  in  Islam”  by  Prof.  (Dr.)  A.  Rahman  (Adam
Publishers and Distributors, New Delhi, 2013 edition), wherein by placing
reliance on a Hanafi Muslim scholar, it was opined that triple talaq was not
in consonance with the verses of the Quran.  Reliance was also placed on
“Imam  Abu  Hanifa  –  Life  and  Work”  by  Allamah  Shiblinu’mani’s  of
Azamgarh, who founded the Shibli College in the 19th century.  Relying
upon a prominent Hanafi Muslim scholar, it was affirmed, that Abu Hanifa
himself had declared, that it was forbidden to give three divorces at the
same time, and whoever did so was a sinner (-for details, refer to paragraph
42).  Based on the aforestated text available in the form of ‘hadiths’, it was
submitted, that the position adopted by the AIMPLB in its pleadings, was
clearly unacceptable, and need to be rejected.  And that, the coclusions
drawn by the four High Courts referred to above, need to be declared as a
valid determination on the subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, in exercise of this
Court’s power under Article 141 of the Constitution.
134. Mr. Kapil Sibal, appearing on behalf of the AIMPLB, contested the
submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners.  In the first instance,
203learned senior counsel placed reliance on verses from the Quran.  Reference
was made to Quran, Al-Hashr 59:71; Quran, Al-Anfal 8:20; Quran, Al-Nisa
4:64; Quran, Al-Anfal 8:13; Quran, Al-Ahzab 33:36; and Quran, Al-Nisa
4:115 (-for details, refer to paragraph 86 above).  Pointedly on the subject of
triple  talaq,  and  in  order  to  demonstrate,  that  the  same  is  not  in
consonance with the Quranic verses, the Court’s attention was drawn to
Quran,  Al-Baqarah  2:229;  Quran,  Al-Baqarah  2:229  and  230;  Quran,
Al-Baqarah 2:232; and Quran, Al-Talaq 65:1 (-for details, refer to paragraph
86 above).  Besides the aforesaid, learned senior counsel invited this Court’s
attention to the statements attributed to the Prophet Mohammad, with
reference to talaq.  On this account, the Court’s attention was drawn to
Daraqutni, Kitab Al-Talaq wa Al-Khula wa Al-Aiyla, 5/23, Hadith number:
3992; Daraqutni, 5/81; Kitab al-Talaq wa Al-Khulawa aI-Aiyala, Hadith
number: 4020; Sunan Bayhaqi, 7/547, Hadith number: 14955; AI-Sunan
AI-Kubra Iil Bayhaqi, Hadith number: 14492; and Sahi al-Bukhari Kitab
al-Talaq, Hadith number: 5259 (-for details, refer to paragraph 86 above).
Representing the AIMPLB, learned senior counsel, also highlighted ‘hadiths’
on the subject of ‘talaq’ and drew our attention to Sunan Abu Dawud, Bad
Karahiya al-Talaq, Hadith no: 2178; Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah, Bab man
kara  an  yatliq  aI  rajal  imratahuu  thalatha  fi  maqad  wahadi  wa  ajaza
dhalika alayhi,  Hadith number: 18089; (Musannaf ibn Abi Shayba, Kitab
al-Talaq, bab fi al rajal yatlaqu imratahuu miata aw alfa,  Hadith number:
18098; Musannaf Abd al-Razzaq, Kitab al-talaq, Hadith number 11340;
Musannaf ibn Abi Shayba, Kitab aI-Talaq, Hadith no: 18091; Musannaf Ibn
204Abi  Shayba,  Hadith  no:  18087;  Al-Muhadhdhab,  4/305;  and  Bukhari,
3/402 (-for details, refer to paragraph 87 above).
135.Having  dealt  with  the  position  expounded  in  the  Quran  and
‘hadiths’ as has been noticed above, learned senior counsel attempted to
repudiate the veracity of the ‘hadiths’ relied upon, in all the four judgments
rendered by the High Courts.  In this behalf learned senior counsel provided
the following complilation for this Court’s consideration:
   1. The Jiauddin Ahmed case2
Sl. No. Reference Comments
(i)Maulana  Mohammad  Ali
(referred to  at paras 7, 11,
12 and 13 of the judgment)He is a Qadiyani.  Mirza Ghulam
Ahmed (founder of the Qadiani
School)  declared  himself  to  be
the  Prophet  after  Prophet
Mohammed  and  it  is  for  this
reason that all Muslims do not
consider the Qadiyani sect to be
a part of the Islamic community.
2. The Rukia Khatun case   3
Sl.
No.Reference Comments
(i) Authorities in this judgment are
identical to the above mentioned
judgment of Jiauddin Ahmed v.
Anwara Begum.
3. The Masroor Ahmed case4
Sl.
No.Reference Comments
(i)Mulla  (Referred  at  the
footnote at page 153 of the
judgment)Approves  the  proposition  that
triple talaq is sinful, yet effective
as an irrevocable divorce.
4. The Nazeer case  5  .
Sl. No.Reference Comments
(i)Basheer  Ahmad  Mohyidin
(Referred at paras 1 and 6
of the judgment)He  wrote  a  commentary  on  the
Quran  entitled  as  Quran:  The
Living Truth, however the extract
relied upon in the decision does
not discuss triple talaq.
205paras  1  and  8  of  the
judgment)Quran  entitled  as  Tafsir  Ibn
Kathir.  He takes the view, that
three  pronouncements  at  the
same time were unlawful.  It is
submitted that he belonged to the
Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi school, which
school  does  not  recognize  triple
talaq.
(iii)Dr.  Tahir  Mahmood
(Referred in para 6 of the
judgment)He was a Professor of Law, Delhi
University.
He wrote a book entitled “Muslim
Law  in  India  and  Abroad”  and
other  books.   Referred  to  other
Islamic scholars to state, that it is
a misconception that three talaqs
have to be pronounced in three
consecutive  months,  it  is  not  a
general  rule  as  the  three
pronouncements have to be made
when  the  wife  is  not  in  her
menses,  which  would  obviously
require about three months.
It  is  submitted,  that  the  said
extract  is  irrelevant  and  out  of
context as it does not specifically
deal with validity of triple talaq.
(iv)Sheikh  Yusuf  Al-Qaradawi
(Referred in para 8 of the
judgment)He  regarded  triple  talaq  as
against God’s law.  It is submitted
that  he  was  a  follower  of  the
Ahl-e-Hadith School.
(v)Mahmoud  Rida  Murad
(Referred in para 8 of the
judgment)He authored the book entitled as
Islamic  Digest  of  Aqeedah  and
Fiqh.  He took the view that triple
talaq  does  not  conform  to  the
teachings of the Prophet.  He is a
follower  of  the  Ahl-e-Hadith
school.
(vi) Sayyid Abdul Ala Maududi
(Referred in para 11 of the
judgment)He  is  a  scholar  of  the  Hanafi
School.   Though  the  passages
extracted  in  the  judgment
indicate that he was of the view
that  three  pronouncements  can
be treated as one depending on
the  intention.   However,
subsequently he has changed his
own  view  and  has  opined  that
triple  talaq  is  final  and
irrevocable.
206(vii)Dr.  Abu  Ameenah  Bilal
Philips (Referred in para 19
of the judgment)He authored the book ‘Evolution
of Fiqh’.  He states that Caliph
Umar  introduced  triple  talaq  in
order  to  discourage  abuse  of
divorce.  He is a follower of the
Ahl-e Hadith school.
(viii)Mohammed Hashim Kamali
(Referred in para 23 of the
judgment)He was of the view that Caliph
Umar  introduced  triple  talaq  in
order  to  discourage  abuse  of
divorce.  He is a professor of law.
It was the submitted on behalf of the AIMPLB, that the views of persons
who are not Sunnis, and those who did not belong to the Hanafi school,
could not have been validly relied upon.  It was submitted, that reliance on
Maulana Muhammad Ali was improper because he was a Qadiyani, and
that Muslims do not consider the Qadiyani sect to be a part of the Islamic
community.  Likewise, it was submitted, that reference to Basheer Ahmad
Mohyidin was misplaced, as the commentary authored by him, did not deal
with the concept of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  Reference to Tafsir Ibn Kathir was
stated to be improper, as he belonged to the Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi school,
which school does not accept triple talaq.  It was submitted, that Dr. Tahir
Mahmood was a Professor of Law at the Delhi University, and his views
must be treated as personal to him, and could not be elevated to the
position of ‘hadiths’.  It was pointed out, that Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi,
was a follower of Ahl-e-Hadith school, and therefore, his views could not be
taken into consideration.  So also, it was submitted, that Mahmoud Rida
Murad was a follower of Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi school.  Reference to Sayyid
Abdul  Ala  Maududi,  it  was  pointed  out,  was  improperly  relied  upon,
because  the  view  expressed  by  the  above  scholar  was  that  “three
207pronouncements  of  talaq  could  be  treated  as  one,  depending  on  the
‘intention’  of  the husband”.   This  position, according to  learned  senior
counsel,  does  not  support  the  position  propounded  on  behalf  of  the
petitioners, because if the ‘intention’ was to make three pronouncements, it
would constitute a valid ‘talaq’.  With reference to Dr. Abu Ameenah Bilal
Philips,  it  was  submitted,  that  he  was  also  a  follower  of  the
Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi  school.   Last  of  all,  with  reference  to  Mohammed
Hashim Kamali, it was pointed out, that he was merely a Professor of Law,
and the views expressed by him should be considered as his personal views.
It was accordingly asserted, that supplanting the views of other schools of
Sunni Muslims, with reference to the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by the
proponents of the Hanafi school, and even with the beliefs of Shia Muslims,
was a clear  breach of a rightful  understanding of the  school,  and the
practice in question.
136.Based on the submissions advanced on behalf of the AIMPLB, as
have been noticed hereinabove, it was sought to be emphasized, that such
complicated issues relating to norms applicable to a religious sect, could
only be determined by the community itself.  Learned counsel cautioned,
this Court from entering into the thicket of the instant determination, as
this Court did not have the expertise to deal with the issue.  
137.Having given our thoughtful consideration, and having examined
the rival ‘hadiths’ relied upon by  learned counsel for the parties, we have
no other option, but to accept the contention of learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the AIMPLB, and to accept his counsel, not to enter
208into the thicket of determining (on the basis of the ‘hadiths’ relied upon)
whether or not ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq, constituted a valid practice
under the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  In fact, even Mr. Salman
Khurshid appearing on behalf of the petitioners (seeking the repudiation of
the practice of the ‘talaq-e-biddat’) had pointed out, that it was not the role
of a court to interprete nuances of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was
pointed out, that under the Muslim ‘personal law’, the religious head – the
Imam would be called upon to decipher the teachings expressed in the
Quran and the ‘hadiths’, in order to resolve a conflict between the parties.
It was submitted, that the Imam alone, had the authority to resolve a
religious  conflict,  amongst Muslims.   It was  submitted,  that  the  Imam
would do so, not on the basis of his own views, but by relying on the verses
from the Quran, and the ‘hadiths’, and based on other jurisprudential tools
available, and thereupon he would render the correct interpretation.  Mr.
Salman Khurshid, learned Senior Advocate also cautioned this Court, that
it was not its role to determine the true intricacies of faith.  
138.All  the  submissions  noted  above,  at  the  behest  of  the  learned
counsel representing the AIMPLB would be inconsequential, if the judgment
rendered by this Court in the Shamim Ara case12, can be accepted as
declaring the legal position in respect of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  Having given a
thoughtful consideration to the contents of the above judgment, it needs to
be recorded, that this Court in the Shamim Ara case12 did not debate the
issue of validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  No submissions have been noticed for or
against,  the  proposition.  Observations  recorded  on  the  subject,  cannot
209therefore be treated as ratio decendi in the matter. In fact, the question of
validity of talaq-e-biddat’ has never been debated before this Court.  This is
the first occasion that the matter is being considered after rival submissions
have been advanced.  Moreover, in the above judgment the Court was
adjudicating a dispute regarding maintenance under Section 125 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure.  The husband, in order to avoid the liability of
maintenance pleaded that he had divorced his wife.  This Court in the above
judgment decided the factual issue as under:
“15. The plea taken by Respondent 2 husband in his written statement
may  be  renoticed.  Respondent  2  vaguely  makes  certain  generalized
accusations against the appellant wife and states that ever since the
marriage  he  found  his  wife  to  be  sharp,  shrewd  and  mischievous.
Accusing the wife of having brought disgrace to the family, Respondent 2
proceeds  to  state,  vide  para  12  (translated  into  English)  —  “The
answering respondent, feeling fed up with all such activities unbecoming
of the petitioner wife, has divorced her on 11-7-1987.” The particulars of
the alleged talaq are not pleaded nor the circumstances under which and
the persons, if any, in whose presence talaq was pronounced have been
stated. Such deficiency continued to prevail even during the trial and
Respondent 2, except examining himself, adduced no evidence in proof of
talaq said to have been given by him on 11-7-1987. There are no reasons
substantiated in justification of talaq and no plea or proof that any effort
at reconciliation preceded the talaq.
16. We are also of the opinion that the  talaq to be effective has to be
pronounced. The term “pronounce” means to proclaim, to utter formally,
to utter rhetorically, to declare, to utter, to articulate (see Chambers 20th
Century Dictionary , New Edition, p. 1030). There is no proof of  talaq
having taken place on 11-7-1987. What the High Court has upheld as
talaq is the plea taken in the written statement and its communication to
the wife by delivering a copy of the written statement on 5-12-1990. We
are  very  clear  in  our  mind  that  a  mere  plea  taken  in  the  written
statement of a divorce having been pronounced sometime in the past
cannot by itself be treated as effectuating talaq on the date of delivery of
the copy of the written statement to the wife. Respondent 2 ought to have
adduced evidence and proved the pronouncement of talaq on 11-7-1987
and if he failed in proving the plea raised in the written statement, the
plea ought to have been treated as failed. We do not agree with the view
propounded in the decided cases referred to by Mulla and Dr Tahir
Mahmood  in  their  respective  commentaries,  wherein  a  mere  plea  of
previous talaq taken in the written statement, though unsubstantiated,
210has been accepted as proof of  talaq bringing to an end the marital
relationship with effect from the date of filing of the written statement. A
plea of previous divorce taken in the written statement cannot at all be
treated as pronouncement of  talaq by the husband on the wife on the
date of filing of the written statement in the Court followed by delivery of
a copy thereof to the wife. So also the affidavit dated 31-8-1988, filed in
some  previous  judicial  proceedings  not  inter  partes,  containing  a
self-serving statement of Respondent 2, could not have been read in
evidence as relevant and of any value.
17. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed. Neither the marriage
between the parties stands dissolved on 5-12-1990 nor does the liability
of Respondent 2 to pay maintenance comes to an end on that day.
Respondent  2  shall  continue  to  remain  liable  for  payment  of
maintenance until the obligation comes to an end in accordance with
law. The costs in this appeal shall be borne by Respondent 2.”
The liability to pay maintenance was accepted, not because ‘talaq-e-biddat’
– triple talaq was not valid in law, but because the husband had not been
able to establish the factum of divorce.  It is therefore not possible to accept
the submission made by learned counsel on the strength of the Shamim Ara
case12.
139.Having given our thoughtful consideration on the entirety of the
issue, we are persuaded to accept the counsel of Mr. Kapil Sibal and Mr.
Salman Khurshid, Senior Advocates.  It would be appropriate for us, to
refrain from entertaining a determination on the issue in hand, irrespective
of the opinion expressed in the four judgments relied upon by learned
counsel for the petitioners, and the Quranic verses and ‘hadiths’ relied upon
by the rival parties.  We truly do not find ourselves, upto the task.  We have
chosen this course, because we are satisfied, that the controversy can be
finally adjudicated, even in the absence of an answer to the proposition
posed in the instant part of the consideration.
IV. Is the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, a matter of faith for Muslims? If yes,
whether it is a constituent of their ‘personal law’ ?
211140.In the two preceding parts of our consideration, we have not been
able to persuade ourselves to disapprove and derecognize the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It may however  still be possible for us, to accept the
petitioners’ prayer, if it can be concluded, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was not a
constituent of ‘personal law’ of Sunni Muslims belonging to the Hanafi
school.  And may be, it was merely a usage or custom. We would, now
attempt to determine an answer to the above  noted poser.
141.As a historical fact, ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is known to have crept into
Muslim tradition more than 1400 years ago, at the instance of Umayyad
monarchs.  It can certainly be traced to the period of Caliph Umar – a senior
companion  of  Prophet Muhammad.  Caliph Umar  succeeded  Abu Bakr
(632-634) as the second Caliph on 23.8.634.  If this position is correct, then
the  practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  can  most  certainly  be  stated  to  have
originated some 1400 years ago.  Factually, Mr. Kapil Sibal had repeatedly
emphasized the above factual aspects, and the same were not repudiated by
any  of  learned  counsel  (-and  private  individuals)  representing  the
petitioner’s cause.
142.The fact, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was widespread can
also not be disputed.  In Part-5 of the instant judgment – Abrogation of the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ by legislation, the world over, in Islamic, as well
as, non-Islamic States, we have dealt with legislations at the hands of Arab
States – Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libiya, Mrocco,
Sudan, Syria, Tunesia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen; we have also dealt
with  legislations  by  South-east  Asian  States  –  Indonesia,  Malaysia,
212Philippines; we have additionally dealt with legislations by sub-continental
States – Pakistan and Bangladesh.  All these countries have legislated with
reference to - ‘talaq-e-biddat’, in one form or the other.  What can certainly
be drawn from all these legislations is, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was a prevalent
practice  amongst  Muslims,  in  these  countries.   Had  it  not  been  so,
legislation would not have been required on the subject.   It is therefore
clear that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was not limited to certain areas,
but was widespread. 
143.We have also extracted in the submissions advanced by learned
counsel representing the rival parties, ‘hadiths’ relied upon by them, to
substantiate their rival contentions.  The debate and discussion amongst
Islamic jurists in the relevant ‘hadiths’ reveal, that the practice of triple
talaq was certainly, in vogue amongst Muslims, whether it was considered
and treated as irregular or sinful, is quite another matter.  All were agreed,
that  though  considered  as  improper  and  sacrilegious,  it  was  indeed
accepted as lawful.  This debate and discussion in the Muslim community –
as has been presently demonstrated by the disputants during the course of
hearing, and as has been highlighted through articles which appeared in
the  media  (at  least  during  the  course  of  hearing),  presumably  by
knowledgeable individuals, reveal views about its sustenance.  The only
debate in these articles was about the consistence or otherwise, of the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – with Islamic values.  Not that, the practice was
not  prevalent.   The  ongoing  discussion  and  dialogue,  clearly  reveal,  if
nothing else, that the practice is still widely prevalent and in vogue.
213144.The fact, that about 90% of the Sunnis in India, belong to the
Hanafi school, and that, they have been adopting ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as a valid
form of divorce, is also not a matter of dispute.  The very fact, that the issue
is being forcefully canvassed, before the highest Court of the land, and at
that – before a Constitution Bench, is proof enough.  The fact that the
judgment of the Privy Council in the Rashid Ahmad case1 as far back as in
1932, upheld the severance of the matrimonial tie, based on the fact that
‘talaq’ had been uttered thrice by the husband, demonstrates not only its
reality, but its enforcement, for the determination of the civil rights of the
parties.  It is therefore clear, that amongst Sunni Muslims belonging to the
Hanafi  school,  the  practice  of   ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  has  been  very  much
prevalent,  since  time  immemorial.   It  has  been  widespread  amongst
Muslims in countries with Muslim popularity.  Even though it is considered
as irreligious within the religious denomination in which the practice is
prevalent, yet the denomination considers it valid in law.  Those following
this practice have concededly allowed their civil rights to be settled thereon.
‘Talaq-e-biddat’ is practiced in India by 90% of the Muslims (who belong to
the Hanafi school).  The Muslim population in India is over 13% (-about
sixteen crores) out of which 4-5 crores are Shias, and the remaining are
Sunnis (besides, about 10 lakhs Ahmadias) – mostly belonging to the Hanafi
school.  And  therefore,  it  would  not  be  incorrect  to  conclude,  that  an
overwhelming majority of Muslims in India, have had  recourse to the
severance of their matrimonial ties, by way of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – as a matter
of their religious belief – as a matter of their faith.  
214145.We  are  satisfied,  that  the  practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  has  to  be
considered  integral  to  the  religious  denomination  in  question  –  Sunnis
belonging to the Hanafi school.  There is not the slightest reason for us to
record otherwise.  We are of the view, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
has had the sanction and approval of the religious denomination which
practiced it, and as such, there can be no doubt that the practice, is a part
of their ‘personal law’.
V. Did the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 confer
statutory status to the subjects regulated by the said legislation ?
146.‘Personal law’ has a constitutional protection.  This protection is
extended to ‘personal law’ through Article 25 of the Constitution.  It needs
to  be  kept  in  mind,  that  the  stature  of  ‘personal  law’  is  that  of  a
fundamental right.  The elevation of ‘personal law’ to this stature came
about when the Constitution came into force.  This was because Article 25
was included in Part III of the Constitution.  Stated differently, ‘personal
law’ of every religious denomination, is protected from invasion and breach,
except as provided by and under Article 25.  
147.The contention now being dealt with, was raised with the object of
demonstrating,  that  after  the  enactment  of  the  Muslim  Personal  Law
(Shariat) Application Act, 1937, the questions and subjects covered by the
Shariat Act, ceased to be ‘personal law’, and got transformed into ‘statutory
law’.  It is in this context, that it was submitted, by Ms. Indira Jaising,
learned senior counsel and some others, that the tag of ‘personal law’ got
removed from the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, after the enactment of
the Shariat Act, at least for the questions/subjects with reference to which
215the  legislation  was  enacted.   Insofar  as  the  present  controversy  is
concerned, suffice it to notice, that the enactment included “… dissolution
of marriage, including talaq …” amongst the questions/subjects covered by
the  Shariat  Act.  And  obviously,  when  the  parties  are  Muslims,  ‘talaq’
includes ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  The pointed contention must be understood to
mean, that after the enactment of the Shariat Act, dissolution of marriage
amongst  Muslims  including  ‘talaq’  (and,  ‘talaq-e-biddat’)  had  to  be
considered as regulated through a State legislation.
148.Having become a part of a State enactment, before the Constitution
of India came into force, it was the submission of learned senior counsel,
that  all  laws  in  force  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  the
Constitution, would continue to be in force even afterwards.  For the instant
assertion, reliance was placed on Article 372 of the Constitution.  We may
only state at this juncture, if the first proposition urged by the learned
senior counsel is correct (that dissolution of marriage amongst Muslims
including ‘talaq’ was regulated statutorily after the 1937 Act), then the latter
part  of  the  submission  advanced,  has  undoubtedly  to  be  accepted  as
accurate. 
149.We have already enumerated the relevant provisions of the Shariat
Act (-for details, refer to Part-4 – Legislation in India, in the field of Muslim
‘personal law’).  A perusal of Section 2 thereof (extracted in paragraph 23
above)  reveals,  that  on  the  questions/subjects  of  intestate  succession,
special  property  of  females,  including  personal  property  inherited  or
obtained under contract or gift or any other provision of ‘personal law’,
216marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq, ila, zihar, lian, khula and
mubaraat,  maintenance,  dower,  guardianship,  gifts,  trusts  and  trust
properties, and wakfs, “… the rule of decision …”, where the parties are
Muslims, shall be “… the Muslim Personal Law – Shariat.  The submission
of the learned counsel representing the petitioners, in support of the instant
contention was, that since the “rule of the decision” inter alia with reference
to ‘talaq’ (-‘talaq-e-biddat’), was thereafter to be regulated in terms of the
Shariat Act, what was ‘personal law’ (-prior to the above enactment), came
to be transformed into ‘statutory law’.  This, according to learned counsel
for  the  petitioners,  has  a  significant  bearing,  inasmuch  as,  what  was
considered as ‘personal law’ prior to the Shariat Act, became an Act of the
State.  Having become an Act of the State, it was submitted, that it has to
satisfy  the  requirements  of  Part  III  –  Fundamental  Rights,  of  the
Constitution.  This, it was pointed out, is indeed the express mandate of
Article  13(1),  which  provides  that  laws  in  force  immediately before  the
commencement of the Constitution, insofar as they are inconsistent with
the provisions of Part III of the Constitution, shall to the extent of such
inconsistency, be considered as void.
150.In order to support the issue being canvassed, it was submitted,
that no “rule of decision” can be violative of Part III of the Constitution.  And
“rule of decision” on questions/subjects covered by the Shariat Act, would
be deemed to be matters of State determination. Learned senior counsel
was however candid, in fairly acknowledging, that ‘personal laws’ which
pertained to disputes between the family and private individuals (where the
217State had no role), cannot be subject to a challenge on the ground, that they
are  violative  of  the  fundamental  rights  contained  in  Part  III  of  the
Constitution.  The simple logic canvassed by learned counsel was, that all
questions pertaining to different ‘personal laws’ amongst Muslims having
been converted into “rule of decision” could no longer be treated as private
matters  between  the  parties,  nor  would  they  be  treated  as  matters  of
‘personal law’’.  In addition, the logic adopted to canvass the above position
was, that if it did not alter the earlier position, what was the purpose of
bringing in the legislation (the Shariat Act). 
151.On  the  assumption,  that  ‘personal  law’  stood  transformed  into
‘statutory  law’,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  petitioners  assailed  the
constitutional validity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, on the touchstone of Articles 14,
15 and 21 of the Constitution.
152.Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for the AIMPLB,
drew our attention to the debates in the Legislative Assembly, whereupon,
the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was enacted (for
details, refer to paragraph 94).  Having invited our attention to the above
debates  and  more  particularly  to  the  statements  of  Abdul  Qaiyum
(representing  North-West  Frontier  Province),  it  was  contended,  that  the
legislation under reference, was not enacted with the object of giving a
statutory status to the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was asserted,
that the object was merely to negate the effect of usages and customs.  It
was pointed out, that even though Muslims were to be regulated under the
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, yet customs and usages to the contrary
218were being given an overriding effect.  To the extent that customs and
usages even of local tribes (-as also of local villages), were being given an
overriding position over Muslim ‘personal law’, in the course of judicial
determination,  even  where  the  parties  were  Muslims.   It was  therefore
asserted, that it would be wrong to assume, that the aim and object of the
legislators, while enacting the Shariat Act, was to give statutory status to
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  In other words, it was the contention of
learned senior counsel, that the Shariat Act should only be understood as
having negated customary practices and usages, which were in conflict with
the existing Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.
153.Mr. V. Giri, learned senior counsel, supported the above contention
by placing reliance on Section 2 of the Muslim Personal  Law (Shariat)
Application Act, 1937, on  behalf of the AIMPLB.  It was asserted, that
Section 2 has a non obstante clause.  It was pointed out, that aforestated
non obstante clause was merely relatable to customs and usages.  A perusal
of Section 2, according to learned senior counsel, would leave no room for
any doubt, that the customs and usages referred to in Section 2 of the
Shariat Act, were only such customs and usages as were in conflict with the
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was accordingly submitted, that the
object behind  Section  2 of  the  Shariat Act was  to  declare  the  Muslim
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, as the “rule of decision”, in situations where
customs and usages were to the contrary.
154.Learned senior counsel for the respondents desired us to accept
their point of view, for yet another reason.  It was submitted, that the
219Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, did not decide what
was, and what was not, Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was therefore
pointed out, that it would be a misnomer to consider, that the Shariat Act,
legislated in the field of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’  in any manner on
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  It was submitted, that Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’ remained what it was. It was pointed out, that articles of
faith as have been expressed on the questions/subjects regulated by the
Shariat Act, have not been dealt with in the Act, they remained the same as
were  understood  by  the  followers  of  that  faith.   It  was  accordingly
contended,  that  the  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’,  was  not
introduced/enacted through the Shariat Act.  It was also pointed out, that
the Shariat Act did not expound or propound the parameters on different
questions or subjects, as were applicable to the Sunnis and Shias, and their
different  schools.   It  was  accordingly  submitted,  that  it  would  be  a
misnomer to interpret the provisions of the Shariat Act, as having given
statutory status to different questions/subjects, with respect to ‘personal
law’ of Muslims.  It was therefore contended, that the Muslim ‘personal law’
– ‘Shariat’ was never metamorphosed  into a statute.  It was therefore
contended,  that  it  would  be  wholly  improper  to  assume  that  Muslim
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ was given statutory effect, through the Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.
155.Based on the above contentions, it was submitted, that the Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 cannot be treated as having
conferred statutory status on the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, and as
220such, the same cannot be treated as a statutory enactment, so as to be
tested for its validity in the manner contemplated under Article 13(1) of the
Constitution.
156.We have  given  our thoughtful  consideration to  the submissions
advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the rival parties.  Having
closely examined Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application
Act, 1937, we are of the view, that the limited purpose of the aforesaid
provision was to negate the overriding effect of usages and customs over the
Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’.   This  determination  of  ours  clearly
emerges  even  from  the  debates  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  before  the
enactment of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.  In fact,
the statements of H.M. Abdullah (representing West Central Punjab) and
Abdul Qaiyum (representing North-West Frontier Province), leave no room
for any doubt, that the objective sought to be achieved by the ‘Shariat’ was
inter alia to negate the overriding effect on customs and usages over the
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  The debates reveal that customs and
usages  by  tribals  were  being  given  overriding  effect  by  courts  while
determining  issues  between  Muslims.   Even  usages  and  customs  of
particular villages were given overriding effect over Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’.  We are also satisfied to accept the contention of the learned
senior counsel, that a perusal of Section 2 and the non obstante clause used
therein, has that effect.  The Shariat Act, in our considered view, neither
lays down nor declares the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.  Not even, on
the questions/subjects covered by the legislation.  There is no room for any
221doubt, that there is substantial divergence of norms regulating Shias and
Sunnis.  There was further divergence of norms, in their respective schools.
The Shariat Act did not crystalise the norms as were to be applicable to
Shias and Sunnis, or their respective schools.  What was sought to be done
through the Shariat Act, in our considered view, was to preserve Muslim
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, as it existed from time immemorial.  We are of the
view, that the Shariat Act recognizes the Muslim ‘personal law’ as the ‘rule
of decision’ in the same manner as Article 25 recognises the supremacy and
enforceability of ‘personal law’ of all religions.  We are accordingly satisfied,
that Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ as body of law, was perpetuated by
the Shariat Act, and what had become ambiguous (due to inundations
through customs and usages), was clarified and crystalised. In contrast, if
such a plea had been raised with reference to the Dissolution of Muslim
Marriages Act, 1939, which legislatively postulated the grounds of divorce
for Muslim women, the submission would have been acceptable.  The 1939
Act would form a part of ‘statutory law’, and not ‘personal law’.  We are
therefore constrained to accept the contention advanced by learned counsel
for  the  respondents,  that  the  proposition  canvassed  on  behalf  of  the
petitioners, namely, that the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act,
1937 conferred statutory status, on the questions/subjects governed by the
Shariat Act, cannot be accepted.  That being the position, Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’ cannot be considered as a State enactment. 
157.In view of the conclusions recorded in the foregoing paragraph, it is
not possible for us to accept, the contention advanced on behalf of the
222petitioners, that the questions/subjects covered by the Muslim Personal
Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 ceased to be ‘personal law’ and got
transformed into ‘statutory law’.  Having concluded as above, we must also
hold (-which we do), that the practices of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’
cannot  be  required  to  satisfy  the  provisions  contained  in  Part  III  –
Fundamental Rights, of the Constitution, applicable to State actions, in
terms of Article 13 of the Constitution.
VI. Does ‘talaq-e-biddat’, violate the parameters expressed in Article 25 of
the Constitution ?
158.In our consideration recorded hereinabove, we have held, that the
provisions of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 did
not alter the ‘personal law’ status of the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.
We shall now deal with the next step. Since ‘talaq-e-biddat’ remains a
matter of ‘personal law’, applicable to a Sunni Muslim belonging to the
Hanafi school, can it be declared as not enforceable in law, as it violates the
parameters  expressed  in  Article  25  (which  is  also  one  of  the  pointed
contentions of those supporting the petitioners case)?
159.The above proposition is strenuously opposed by all the learned
counsel who appeared on behalf of the respondents, more particularly,
learned senior counsel representing the AIMPLB.  During the course of the
instant opposition, our attention was invited to the judgment rendered by
the Bombay High Court in the Narasu Appa Mali case23.  We may briefly
advert thereto.  In the said judgment authored by M.C. Chagla, CJ, in
paragraph 13 and Gajendragadkar, J. (as he then was) in paragraph 23,
recorded the following observations:
223“13. That this distinction is recognised by the Legislature is clear if one looks to
the language of S. 112, Government of India Act, 1915. That section deals with
the law to be administered by the High Courts and it provides that the High
Courts shall, in matters of inheritance and succession to lands, rents and
goods, and in matters of contract and dealing between party and party, when
both parties are subject to the same personal law or custom having the force of
law, decide according to that personal law or custom, and when the parties are
subject to different personal laws or customs having the force of law, decide
according to the law or custom to which the defendant is subject . Therefore, a
clear distinction is drawn between personal law and custom having the force of
law. This is a provision in the Constitution Act, and having this model before
them the Constituent Assembly in defining “law” in Art. 13 have expressly and
advisedly  used  only  the  expression  “custom  or  usage”  and  have  omitted
personal law. This, in our opinion, is a very clear pointer to the intention of the
Constitution-making body to exclude personal law from the purview of Art. 13.
There  are  other  pointers  as  well.  Article  17  abolishes  untouchability  and
forbids its practice in any form. Article 25(2)(b) enables the State to make laws
for the purpose of throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public
character to all classes and sections of Hindus. Now, if Hindu personal law
became  void by reason of Art. 13 and by reason of any of its provisions
contravening any fundamental right, then it was unnecessary specifically to
provide in Art. 17 and Art. 25(2)(b) for certain aspects of Hindu personal law
which contravened Arts. 14 and 15 . This clearly shows that only in certain
respects has the Constitution dealt with personal law. The very presence of Art.
44 in the Constitution recognizes the existence of separate personal laws, and
Entry No. 5 in the Concurrent List gives power to the Legislatures to pass laws
affecting personal law. The scheme of the Constitution, therefore, seems to be
to leave personal law unaffected except where specific provision is made with
regard to it and leave it to the Legislatures in future to modify and improve it
and ultimately to put on the statute book a common and uniform Code . Our
attention has been drawn to S. 292, Government of India Act, 1935, which
provides that all the law in force in British India shall continue in force until
altered or repealed or amended by a competent Legislature or other competent
authority, and S. 293 deals with adaptation of existing penal laws. There is a
similar  provision  in  our  Constitution  in  Art.  372(1)  and  Art.  372(2).  It  is
contended that the laws which are to continue in force under Art. 372(1)
include personal laws, and as these laws are to continue in force subject to the
other provisions of the Constitution, it is urged that by reason of Art. 13(1) any
provision in any personal law which is inconsistent with fundamental rights
would be void. But it is clear from the language of Arts. 372(1) and (2) that the
expression “laws in force” used in this article does not include personal
law because Art. 372(2) entitles the President to make adaptations and
modifications to the law in force by way of repeal or amendment, and
surely it cannot be contended that it was intended by this provision to
authorise  the  President  to  make  alterations  or  adaptations  in  the
personal law of any community.  Although the point urged before us is
not  by any  means  free  from  difficulty,  on  the  whole  after  a  careful
consideration of the various provisions of the Constitution, we have come
to the conclusion that personal law is not included in the expression
“laws in force” used in Art. 13(1) .
22423.  …..T  he Constitution of India itself recognises the existence of these
personal  laws  in  terms  when  it  deals  with  the  topics  falling  under
personal law in item 5 in the Concurrent List—List III. This item deals
with the topics of marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption;
wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and partition; all matters in
respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before
the commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law.
Thus it is competent either to the State or the Union Legislature to
legislate on topics falling within the purview of the personal law and yet
the expression “personal law” is not used in Art. 13. because, in my
opinion, the framers of the Constitution wanted to leave the personal
laws outside the ambit of Part III of the Constitution . They must have
been aware that these personal laws needed to be reformed in many
material particulars and in fact they wanted to abolish these different
personal laws and to evolve one common code. Yet they did not wish that
the provisions of the personal laws should be challenged by reason of the
fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution and so they
did not intend to include these personal laws within the definition of the
expression  “laws  in  force.”  Therefore,  I  agree  with  the  learned  Chief
Justice in holding that the personal laws do not fall within Art. 13(1) at
all.”
160.It seems to us, that the position expressed by the Bombay High
Court,  as  has  been  extracted  above,  deserves  to  be  considered  as  the
presently  declared  position  of  law,  more  particularly,  because  it  was
conceded on behalf of the learned Attorney General for India, that the
judgment rendered by the Bombay High Court in the Narasu Appa Mali
case23, has been upheld by the Court in the Shri Krishna Singh case29 and
the  Maharshi  Avadhesh32 cases,  wherein,  this  Court  had  tested  the
‘personal laws’ on the touchstone of fundamental rights in the cases of
Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum49 (by a 5-Judge Constitution
Bench), Daniel Latifi v. Union of India50 (by a 5-Judge Constitution Bench),
and in the John Vallamattom case9, (by a 3-Judge Division Bench).  An
extract of the written submissions placed on the record of the case, on
49
50
225behalf of the Union of India, has been reproduced verbatim in paragraph 71
above.
161.The fair concession made at the hands of the learned Attorney
General, is reason enough for us to accept the proposition, and the legal
position expressed by the Bombay High Court, relevant part whereof has
been extracted above.  Despite our instant determination, it is essential for
us to notice a few judgments on the issue, which would put a closure to the
matter.
(i)Reference may first of all be made to the Shri Krishna Singh case29.
The factual position which arose in the above case, may be noticed as
under:
 ‘S’, a Hindu ascetic, established the Garwaghat Math at Varanasi in 1925.
The ‘math’ (monastery) comprised of Bangla Kuti and other buildings and
lands endowed by his devotees.  ‘S’ belonged to the Sant Math Sampradaya,
which is a religious denomination of the Dasnami sect, founded by the
‘Sankaracharya’ (head of a monastery).  During this lifetime, ‘S’ initiated ‘A’
as his ‘chela’ (disciple) and gave him full rights of initiation and ‘bhesh’
(spiritual authority).  After the death of ‘S’, his ‘bhesh’ and sampradaya
(succession of master or disciples) gave ‘A’ the ‘chadar mahanti’ (cloak of the
chief  priest)  of  the  ‘math’  and  made  him  the  ‘mahant’  (chief  priest),
according to the wishes of ‘S’.  ‘A’ thereafter initiated the plaintiff, a ‘sudra’
(lowest caste of the four Hindu castes), as his ‘chela’ according to the
custom and usage of the sect and after this death, in accordance with his
wishes the ‘mahants’ and ‘sanyasis’ (persons leading a life of renunciation)
226of the ‘bhesh’ and ‘sampradaya’ gave the ‘chadar mahanti’ to the plaintiff,
and installed him as the ‘mahant’ of the ‘math’ in the place of ‘A’, by
executing a document to that effect.  ‘A’ during his life time purchased two
houses in the city of Varanasi, from out of the income of the ‘math’.  When
the  plaintiff  became  the  ‘mahant’,  he  brought  a  suit  for  ejectment  of
Respondents  2  to  5  from  one  of  those  houses,  on  the  ground  that
Respondent 2 after taking the house on rent from ‘A’, had unlawfully sublet
the premises to Respondents 3 to 5.  The defendant respondents inter alia
pleaded, that they were in occupation of the house as ‘chelas’ of ‘A’, in their
own rights, by virtue of a licence granted to them by ‘A’, and therefore, on
his death his natural son and disciple, the appellant became the owner
thereof.  One of the questions which needed to be determined in the above
controversy, was formulated as under:
(1) Whether the plaintiff being a ‘sudra’ could not be ordained to a
religious order and become a ‘sanyasi’ or ‘yati’ and therefore, installed as
‘mahant’ according to the tenets of the Sant Mat Sampradaya?
In  recording  its  conclusions  with  reference  to  Article  25,  in  the  above
disputed issue, this Court held as under:
“17. It  would  be  convenient,  at  the  outset,  to  deal  with  the  view
expressed by the High Court that the strict rule enjoined by the Smriti
writers as a result of which Sudras were considered to be incapable of
entering the order of yati or sanyasi, has ceased to be valid because of
the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. In
our opinion, the learned Judge failed to appreciate that Part III of the
Constitution does not touch upon the personal laws of the parties.  In
applying the personal laws of the parties, he could not introduce his own
concepts of modern times but should have enforced the law as derived
from recognised and authoritative sources of Hindu law i.e. Smritis and
commentaries referred to, as interpreted in the judgments of various
High Courts, except, where such law is altered by any usage or custom
or is modified or abrogated by statute .”
227(ii) Reference is also essential to  Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar51, 
wherein this Court observed a under:
“It is worthwhile to account some legislation on the subject.     The Hindu
Succession Act     governs and prescribes rules of succession applicable to
a large majority of Indians being Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains etc.
whereunder since 1956, if not earlier, the female heir is put on a par with
a male heir. Next in the line of numbers is the Shariat law, applicable to
Muslims,  whereunder  the  female  heir  has  an  unequal  share  in  the
inheritance, by and large half of what a male gets. Then comes the     Indian
Succession Act     which applies to Christians and by and large to people
not covered under the aforesaid two laws, conferring in a certain manner
heirship on females as also males . Certain chapters thereof are not made
applicable to certain communities.  Sub-section (2) of     Section 2   of the
Hindu Succession Act significantly provides that nothing contained in
the Act shall apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the
meaning  of  clause  (25)  of    Article  366     of  the  Constitution,  unless
otherwise directed by the Central Government by means of a notification
in the Official Gazette .  Section 3(2) further provides that in the Act,
unless the context otherwise requires, words importing the masculine
gender shall not be taken to include females. General rule of legislative
practice is that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or
context, words importing the masculine gender used in statutes are to be
taken to include females. Attention be drawn to  Section 13 of the General
Clauses Act. But in matters of succession the general rule of plurality
would have to be applied with circumspection. The afore provision thus
appears to have been inserted ex abundanti cautela. Even under     Section
3     of the Indian Succession Act, the State Government is empowered to
exempt any race, sect or tripe from the operation of the Act and the
tribes of Mundas, Oraons, Santhals etc. in the State of Bihar, who are
included in our concern, have been so exempted. Thus neither the     Hindu
Succession  Act  ,  nor  even  the  Shariat  law  is  applicable  to  the
custom-governed tribals. And custom, as is well recognized, varies from
people to people and region to region .”
In  the  face  of  these  divisions  and  visible  barricades  put  up  by  the
sensitive tribal people valuing their own customs, traditions and usages,
judicially enforcing on them the principles of personal laws applicable to
others,  on  an  elitist  approach  or  on  equality  principle,  by  judicial
activism, is a difficult and mind-boggling effort. Brother K. Ramaswamy,
J.  seems  to  have  taken  the  view  that  Indian  legislatures  (and
Governments  too)  would  not  prompt  themselves  to  activate  in  this
direction because of political reasons and in this situation, an activist
court. apolitical as it avowedly is, could get into action and legislate
broadly on the lines as suggested by the petitioners in their written
submissions. However laudable, desirable and attractive the result may
seem, it has happily been viewed by our learned brother that an activist
51
228court is not fully equipped to cope with the details and intricacies of the
legislative subject and can at best advise and focus attention on the
State polity on the problem and shake it from its slumber, goading it to
awaken, march and reach the goal. For, in whatever measure be the
concern of the court, it compulsively needs to apply, motion, described in
judicial parlance as self-restraint. We agree therefore with brother K.
Ramaswamy, J. as summed up by him in the paragraph ending on p.36
(para 46) of his judgment that under the circumstances it is not desirable
to declare the customs of tribal inhabitants as offending Articles 14, 45
and 21 of the Constitution and each case must be examined when full
facts are placed before the court .
With regard to the statutory provisions of the Act, he has proposed to the
reading  down  of  Sections  7 and  8 in  order  to  preserve  their
constitutionality. This approach is available from p.36 (paras 47, 48)
onwards  of  his  judgment.  The  words  ""male  descendant  wherever
occurring , would include ""female descendants"". It is also proposed that
even though the provisions of the  Hindu Succession Act , 1925 in terms
would  not  apply  to  the  Schedule  Tribes,  their  general  principles
composing of justice, equity and fair play would apply to them. On this
basis it has been proposed to take the view that the Scheduled Tribe
women  would  succeed  to  the  estate  of  paternal  parent,  brother  or
husband as heirs by intestate succession and inherit the property in
equal shares with the male heir with absolute rights as per the principles
of the Hindu Succession Act  as also the Indian Succession Act . However,
much we may like the law to be so we regret our inability to subscribe to
the means in achieving such objective. If this be the route of return on
the court's entering the thicket, it would follow a beeline for similar
claims in diverse situations, not stopping at tribal definitions, and a
deafening uproar to bring other systems of law in line with the line with
the systems of law in line with the     Hindu Succession Act     and the     Indian
Succession Act     as models. Rules of succession are, indeed susceptible of
providing differential treatment, not necessarily equal. Non-uniformities
would not in all events violate  Article 14. Judge-made amendments to
provisions, should normally be avoided. We are thus constrained to take
this view. even though it may appear to be conservative for adopting a
cautious approach, and the one proposed by our learned brother is,
regretfully not acceptable to us.”
(iii) In the Ahmedabad Women Action Group case30, this Court recorded
the questions arising for consideration  in pargraphs 1 to 3, which are
reproduced below:
“All these Writ Petitions are filed as Public Interest Litigation. In W.P. (C)
No. 494 of 1996, the reliefs prayed for are as follows:
(a) to declare Muslim Personal Law which allows polygamy as void as
offending Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution;
229(b) to declare Muslim Personal Law which enables a Muslim male to give
unilateral Talaq to his wife without her consent and without resort to
judicial process of courts, as void, offending Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the
Constitution;
(c) to declare that the mere fact that a Muslim husband takes more than
one  wife  is  an  act  of  cruelty  within  the  meaning  of  Clause  VIII  (f)
of Section 2 of Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939;
(d) to declare that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act,
1986 is void as infringing Articles 14 and 15;
(e) to further declare that the provisions of Sunni and Shia laws of
inheritance  which  discriminate  against  females  in  their  share  as
compared  to  the  share  of  males  of  the  same  status,  void  as
discriminating against females only on the ground of sex.
2.In writ Petition (C) No. 496 of 1996, the reliefs prayed for are the
following:-
(a) to declare Sections 2(2), 5(ii) and (iii), 6 and Explanation to  Section
30 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, as void offending Articles 14 and 15
read with Article 13 of the Constitution of India;
(b) to declare Section (2) of  Hindu Marriage Act , 1955, as void offending
Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India;
(c)  to  declare  Sections  3 (2),  6  and  9  of  the  Hindu  Minority
and Guardianship Act  read with Section 6 of Guardians and Wards Act
void;
(d) to declare the unfettered and absolute discretion allowed to a Hindu
spouse  to  make  testamentary  disposition  without  providing  for  an
ascertained share of his or her spouse and dependant, void. 
3. In writ Petition (C) No. 721 of 1996, the   reliefs    prayed   for   are the
following :
(a) to declare Sections 10 and 34 of Indian Divorce Act void and also to
declare Sections 43 to 46 of the Indian Succession Act void.”
The position expressed in respect of the above questions, after noticing the
legal position propounded by this Court in the Madhu Kishwar case39, was
recorded in paragraph 4 as under:
“4. At the outset. we would like to state that these Writ Petitions do not
deserve disposal on merits inasmuch as the arguments advanced by the
learned Senior Advocate before us wholly involve issues of State policies
with which the Court will not ordinarily have any concern. Further, we
find that when similar attempts were made, of course by others, on
earlier occasions this Court held that the remedy lies somewhere else
and not by knocking at the doors of the courts.”
(iv) Reference may also be made to the Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin
Saheb case28, wherein, this Court held as under:
230“The content of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution came up for
consideration before this Court in the Commissioner, Hindu Religious
Endowments Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur
Matt;  Mahant  Jagannath  Ramanuj  Das  v.  The  State  of  Orissa;  Sri
Ventatamana Devaru v. The State of Mysore; Durgah Committee, Ajmer
v. Syed Hussain Ali and several other cases and  the main principles
underlying these provisions have by these decisions been placed beyond
controversy.  The first is that the protection of these articles is not
limited to matters of doctrine or belief they extend also to acts done in
pursuance of religion and therefore contain a guarantee for rituals and
observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts
of religion.  The second is that what constitutes an essential part of a
religion  or  religious  practice  has  to  be  decided  by  the  courts  with
reference to the doctrine of a particular religion and include practices
which are regarded by the community as a part of its religion ”.
(v) It is also essential to note the N. Adithyan case33, wherein this
Court observed as under:
“9. This Court, in Seshammal v. State of T.N., (1972) 2 SCC 11 again
reviewed the principles underlying the protection engrafted in Articles 25
and 26 in the context of a challenge made to abolition of hereditary right
of Archaka, and reiterated the position as hereunder: (SCC p.21, paras
13-14)
“13. This Court in Sardar Taher Saifuddin Saheb v. State of Bombay AIR
1962 SC 853 has summarized the position in law as follows (pp.531 and
532):
‘The content of Articles 25  and 26 of the Constitution  came  up  for
consideration before this Court in Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments
v.  Sri  Lakshmindra  Thirtha  Swamiar  of  Sri  Shirur  Mutt,  Mahant
Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. State of Orissa, Venkataramana Devaru v.
State of Mysore, Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali and
several other cases and the main principles underlying these provisions
have by these decisions been placed beyond controversy.  The first is that
the protection of these articles is not limited to matters of doctrine or
belief they extend also to acts done in pursuance of religion and therefore
contain a guarantee for rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes
of worship which are integral parts of religion.  The second is that what
constitutes an essential part of a religion or religious practice has to be
decided  by the  courts  with  reference  to  the  doctrine  of  a particular
religion and include practices which are regarded by the community as a
part of its religion .’
14.  Bearing  these  principles  in  mind,  we  have  to  approach  the
controversy in the present case.”
16.  It is now well settled that Article 25 secures to every person, subject
of course to public order, health and morality and other provisions of
Part III, including Article 17 freedom to entertain and exhibit by outward
231acts as well as propagate and disseminate such religious belief according
to his judgment and conscience for the edification of others .  The right of
the State to impose such restrictions as are desired or found necessary
on grounds of public order, health and morality is inbuilt in Articles 25
and 26 itself.  Article 25(2)(b) ensures the right of the State to make a law
providing for social welfare and reform besides throwing open of Hindu
religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of
Hindus and any such rights of the Sate or of the communities or classes
of society were also considered to need due regulation in the process of
harmonizing the various rights .  The vision of the founding fathers of the
Constitution to liberate the society from blind and ritualistic adherence
to mere traditional superstitious beliefs sans reason or rational basis has
found expression in the form of Article 17.  The legal position that the
protection under Articles 25 and 26 extends a guarantee for rituals and
observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts
of religion and as to what really constitutes an essential part of religion
or religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the
doctrine of a particular religion or practices regarded as parts of religion,
came to be equally firmly laid down .”
(vi)  Relevant  to  the  issue  is  also  the  judgment  in  the  Sri  Adi
Visheshwara of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi case34, wherein it was
held:
“28…..All secular activities which may be associated with religion but
which do not relate or constitute an essential part of it may be amenable
to State regulations but what constitutes the essential part of religion
may be ascertained primarily from the doctrines of that religion itself
according to its tenets, historical background and change in evolved
process etc.  The concept of essentiality is not itself a determinative
factor.  It is one of the circumstances to be considered in adjudging
whether the particular matters of religion or religious practices or belief
are an integral part of the religion.  It must be decided whether the
practices or matters are considered integral by the community itself .
Though not conclusive, this is also one of the facets to be noticed.  The
practice in question is religious in character and whether it could be
regarded as an integral and essential part of the religion and if the court
finds upon evidence adduced before it that it is an integral or essential
part of the religion, Article 25 accords protection to it. …..”
(vii)  The position seems to be clear, that the judicial interference with
‘personal law’ can be rendered only in such manner as has been provided
for in  Article  25 of the  Constitution.   It is  not possible  to breach the
232parameters of matters of faith, as they have the protective shield of Article
25 (except as provided in the provision itself).
162. To be fair to the learned Attorney General, it is necessary to record,
that he contested the determination recorded by the Bombay High Court in
the Narasu Appa Mali case23, and the judgments rendered by this Court
affirming the same, by assuming the stance that the position needed to be
revisited (-for details, refer to paragraph 71 above).  There are two reasons
for us not to entertain this plea.  Firstly, even according to the learned
Attorney General, the proposition has been accepted by this Court in at
least two judgments rendered by Constitution Benches (-of 5-Judge each),
and as such, we (-as a 5-Judge Bench) are clearly disqualified to revisit the
proposition.  And secondly, a challenge to ‘personal law’ is also competent
under Article 25, if the provisions of Part III – Fundamental Rights, of the
Constitution, are violated, which we shall in any case consider (hereinafter)
while examining the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners.
Likewise, we shall not dwell upon the submissions advanced in rebuttal by
Mr. Kapil Sibal, Senior Advocate.
163.So  far  as  the  challenge  to  the  practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  with
reference  to  the  constitutional  mandate  contained  in  Article  25  is
concerned, we have also delved into the submissions canvassed, during the
course of hearing. It would be pertinent to mention, that the constitutional
protection to tenets of ‘personal law’ cannot be interfered with, as long as
the same do not infringe “public order, morality and health”, and/or “the
233provisions  of  Part  III  of  the  Constitution”.   This  is  the  clear  position
expressed in Article 25(1).  
164.We will now venture to examine the instant challenge with reference
to the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  It is not possible for us to accept, that the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ can be set aside and held as unsustainable in
law for the three defined purposes expressed in Article 25(1), namely, for
reasons of it being contrary to public order, morality and health.  Viewed
from any angle, it is impossible to conclude, that the practice impinges on
‘public order’, or for that matter on ‘health’.  We are also satisfied, that it
has no nexus to ‘morality’, as well.  Therefore, in our considered view, the
practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  cannot  be  struck  down  on  the  three
non-permissible/prohibited areas which Article 25 forbids even in respect of
‘personal law’. It is therefore not possible for us to uphold the contention
raised on behalf of the petitioners on this account.  
165.The  only  remaining  ground  on  which  the  challenge  to
‘talaq-e-biddat’ under Article 25 could be sustainable is, if ‘talaq-e-biddat’
can be seen as violative of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.  The
challenge raised at the behest of the petitioners, as has been extensively
noticed during the course of recording the submissions advanced on behalf
of the petitioners, was limited to the practice being allegedly violative of
Articles 14, 15 and 21.  We shall now examine the veracity of the instant
contention.  The fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 14, 15 and 21 are
as against State actions.  A challenge under these provisions (Articles 14,
15 and 21) can be invoked only against the State.  It is essential to keep in
234mind, that Article 14 forbids the State from acting arbitrarily.  Article 14
requires the State to ensure equality before the law and equal protection of
the laws, within the territory of India.  Likewise, Article 15 prohibits the
State from taking discriminatory action on the grounds of religion, race,
caste, sex or place of birth, or any of them. The mandate of Article 15
requires, the State to treat everyone equally.  Even Article 21 is a protection
from State action, inasmuch as, it prohibits the State from depriving anyone
of the rights enuring to them, as a matter of life and liberty (-except, by
procedure established by law).  We have already rejected the contention
advanced on behalf of the petitioners, that the provisions of the Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, did not alter the ‘personal law’
status of ‘Shariat’.  We have not accepted, that after the enactment of the
Shariat Act, the questions/subjects covered by the said legislation ceased to
be ‘personal law’, and got transformed into ‘statutory law’.  Since we have
held  that  Muslim  ‘personal  law’  –  ‘Shariat’  is  not  based  on  any  State
Legislative action, we have therefore held, that Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’,  cannot  be  tested  on  the  touchstone  of  being  a  State  action.
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, in our view, is a matter of ‘personal law’ of
Muslims, to be traced from four sources, namely, the Quran, the ‘hadith’,
the ‘ijma’ and the ‘qiyas’. None of these can be attributed to any State
action.  We have also already concluded, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is a practice
amongst  Sunni  Muslims  of  the  Hanafi  school.   A  practice  which  is  a
component of the ‘faith’ of those belonging to that school.  ‘Personal law’,
being a matter of religious faith, and not being State action, there is no
235question of its being violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India,
more particularly, the provisions relied upon by the petitioners, to assail the
practice  of  ‘talaq-e-biddat’,  namely,  Articles  14,  15  and  21  of  the
Constitution.
VII. Constitutional morality and ‘talaq-e-biddat’:
166.One of the issues canvassed on behalf of the petitioners, which was
spearheaded by the learned Attorney General for India, was on the ground,
that the constitutional validity of the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple
talaq, was in breach of constitutional morality.  The question raised before
us  was,  whether  under  a  secular  Constitution,  women  could  be
discriminated against, only on account of their religious identity?  It was
asserted, that women belonging to any individual religious denomination,
cannot  suffer  a  significantly  inferior  status  in  society,  as  compared  to
women professing some other religion.  It was pointed out, that Muslim
women,  were  placed  in  a  position  far  more  vulnerable  than  their
counterparts, who professed other faiths.  It was submitted, that Hindu,
Christian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain women, were not subjected to
ouster from their matrimonial relationship, without any reasonable cause,
certainly  not,  at  the  whim  of  the  husband;  certainly  not,  without  due
consideration of the views expressed by the wife, who had the right to repel
a husband’s claim for divorce.  It was asserted, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’, vests
an  unqualified  right  with  the  husband,  to  terminate  the  matrimonial
alliance forthwith, without any reason or justification.  It was submitted,
that the process of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is extra-judicial, and as such, there are
236no remedial measures in place, for raising a challenge, to the devastating
consequences  on  the  concerned  wife.   It  was  pointed  out,  that  the
fundamental right to equality, guaranteed to every citizen under Article 14
of the Constitution, must be read to include, equality amongst women of
different religious denominations.  It was submitted, that gender equality,
gender equity and gender justice, were values intrinsically intertwined in
the guarantee assured to all (-citizens, and foreigners) under Article 14.  It
was asserted, that the conferment of social status based on patriarchal
values, so as to place womenfolk at the mercy of men, cannot be sustained
within the framework of the fundamental rights, provided for under Part III
of the Constitution.  It was contended, that besides equality, Articles 14 and
15 prohibit gender discrimination.  It was pointed out, that discrimination
on the ground of sex, was expressly prohibited under Article 15.  It was
contended, that the right of a woman to human dignity, social esteem and
self-worth were vital facets, of the right to life under Article 21.  It was
submitted, that gender justice was a constitutional goal, contemplated by
the  framers  of  the  Constitution.   Referring  to  Article  51A(e)  of  the
Constitution, it was pointed out, that one of the declared fundamental
duties contained in Part IV of the Constitution, was to ensure that women
were not subjected to derogatory practices, which impacted their dignity.  It
was  pointed  out,  that  gender  equality  and  dignity  of  women,  were
non-negotiable.  It was highlighted, that women constituted half of the
nation’s  population,  and  inequality  against  women,  should  necessarily
entail an inference of wholesale gender discrimination.  
237167.In order to support the submissions advanced on behalf of the
petitioners, as have been noticed hereinabove, reliance was placed on Sarla
Mudgal  v.  Union  of  India52.   Our  pointed  attention  was  drawn  to  the
following observations recorded therein:
“44. Marriage, inheritance, divorce, conversion are as much religious in
nature and content as any other belief or faith. Going round the fire
seven rounds or giving consent before Qazi are as much matter of faith
and conscience as the worship itself . When a Hindu becomes a convert
by  reciting  Kalma  or  a  Mulsim  becomes  Hindu  by  reciting  certain
Mantras it is a matter of belief and conscience. Some of these practices
observed by members of one religion may appear to be excessive and
even violative of human rights to members of another. But these are
matters of faith . Reason and logic have little role to play . The sentiments
and emotions have to be cooled and tempered by sincere effort. But today
there is no Raja Ram Mohan Rai who single handedly brought about that
atmosphere which paved the way for Sati abolition. Nor is a statesman of
the stature of Pt. Nehru who could pilot through, successfully, the Hindu
Succession  Act  and Hindu Marriage  Act  revolutionising  the  customary
Hindu Law. The desirabilit  y of uniform Code can hardly be doubted. But
it can concretize only when social climate is properly built up by elite of
the society, statesmen amongst leaders who instead of gaining personal
mileage rise above and awaken the masses to accept the change .”
Reliance was also placed on the Valsamma Paul case20, wherefrom learned
counsel  emphasized  on  the  observations  recorded  in  the  following
paragraphs:
“6. The rival contentions give rise to the question of harmonising the
conflict  between  the  personal  law  and  the  constitutional  animation
behind Articles 16(4) and 15(4) of the Constitution. The concepts of
“equality before law” and “equal protection of the laws” guaranteed by
Article 14 and its species Articles 15(4) and 16(4) aim at establishing
social  and  economic  justice  in  political  democracy to  all  sections  of
society, to eliminate inequalities in status and to provide facilities and
opportunities not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of
people belonging  to  Scheduled  Castes  (for  short  ‘Dalits’),  Scheduled
Tribes (for short ‘Tribes’) and Other Backward Classes of citizens (for
short ‘OBCs’) to secure adequate means of livelihood and to promote with
special  care  the  economic  and  educational  interests  of  the  weaker
sections of the people, in particular, Dalits and Tribes so as to protect
52
238them  from  social  injustice  and  all  forms  of  exploitation.  By  42  nd
Constitution (Amendment) Act, secularism and socialism were brought in
the Preamble of the Constitution to realise that in a democracy unless all
sections of society are provided facilities and opportunities to participate
in political democracy irrespective of caste, religion and sex, political
democracy would not last long . Dr Ambedkar in his closing speech on
the draft Constitution stated on 25-11-1949 that “ what we must do is
not to be attained with mere political democracy; we must make our
political  democracy  a  social  democracy  as  well.  Political  democracy
cannot last unless there lies on the base of it a social democracy ”.
Social democracy means “a way of life which recognises liberty, equality
and fraternity as principles of life ”. They are not separate items in a
trinity but they form union of trinity. To diversity one from the other is to
defeat the very purpose of democracy. Without equality, liberty would
produce  the  supremacy  of  the  few  over  the  many.  Equality  without
liberty  would  kill  individual  initiative.  Without  fraternity,  liberty  and
equality could not become a natural course of things. Articles 15(4) and
16(4), therefore, intend to remove social and economic inequality to make
equal opportunities available in reality . Social and economic justice is a
right enshrined for the protection of society.  The right to social and
economic  justice  envisaged  in  the  Preamble  and  elongated  in  the
Fundamental  Rights  and  Directive  Principles  of  the  Constitution,  in
particular, Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 38, 39 and 46 of the Constitution, is
to make the quality of the life of the poor, disadvantaged and disabled
citizens of society, meaningful . Equal protection in Article 14 requires
affirmative  action  for  those  unequals  by  providing  facilities  and
opportunities. While Article 15(1) prohibits discrimination on grounds of
religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, Article 15(4) enjoins upon the
State, despite the above injunction and the one provided in Article 29(2),
to  make  special  provision  for  the  advancement  of  any  socially  and
educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Dalits and Tribes.
Equally, while Article 16(1) guarantees equality of opportunity for all
citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office
under the State, Article 16(4) enjoins upon the State to make provision
for reservation for these sections which in the opinion of the State are
not adequately represented in the services under the State . Article 335 of
the Constitution mandates that claims of the members of the Dalits and
Tribes  shall  be  taken  into  consideration  in  making  appointments  to
services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union or of a State
consistent  with  the  maintenance  of  efficiency  of  administration.
Therefore, this Court interpreted that equal protection guaranteed by
Articles  14,  15(1)  and  16(1)  is  required  to  operate  consistently  with
Articles 15(4), 16(4), 38, 39, 46 and 335 of the Constitution, vide per
majority in     Indra Sawhney     v.  Union of India     [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 ]
known as Mandal case [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217]. In other words, equal
protection requires affirmative action for those unequals handicapped
due to historical facts of untouchability practised for millennium which
239is  abolished  by  Article  17;  for  tribes  living  away  from  our  national
mainstream due to social and educational backwardness of OBCs.

16. The Constitution seeks to establish a secular socialist democratic
republic in which every citizen has equality of status and of opportunity,
to promote among the people dignity of the individual, unity and integrity
of the nation transcending them from caste, sectional, religious barriers
fostering fraternity among them in an integrated Bharat . The emphasis,
therefore, is on a citizen to improve excellence and equal status and
dignity  of  person.  With  the  advancement  of  human  rights  and
constitutional  philosophy  of  social  and  economic  democracy  in  a
democratic polity to all the citizens on equal footing, secularism has been
held  to  be  one  of  the  basic  features  of  the  Constitution  (Vide:  S.R.
Bommai v. Union of India  (1994) 3 SCC 1) and egalitarian social order is
its foundation. Unless free mobility of the people is allowed transcending
sectional, caste, religious or regional barriers, establishment of secular
socialist  order  becomes  difficult.  In     State  of  Karnataka     v.     Appa  Balu
Ingale     [1995 Supp (4) SCC 469] this Court has held in para 34 that
judiciary acts as a bastion of the freedom and of the rights of the people.
The Judges are participants in the living stream of national life, steering
the law between the dangers of rigidity and formlessness in the seamless
web  of  life.  A  Judge  must  be  a  jurist  endowed  with  the  legislator's
wisdom,  historian's  search  for  truth,  prophet's  vision,  capacity  to
respond to the needs of the present, resilience to cope with the demands
of the future to decide objectively, disengaging himself/herself from every
personal influence or predilections . The Judges should adapt purposive
interpretation of the dynamic concepts under the Constitution and the
Act with its interpretative armoury to articulate the felt necessities of the
time. Social legislation is not a document for fastidious dialects but
means of ordering the life of the people. To construe law one must enter
into its spirit, its setting and history . Law should be capable to expand
freedom of the people and the legal order can weigh with utmost equal
care to provide the underpinning of the highly inequitable social order.
Judicial  review  must  be  exercised  with  insight  into  social  values  to
supplement the changing social needs. The existing social inequalities or
imbalances  are  required  to  be  removed  readjusting  the  social  order
through rule of law . In that case, the need for protection of right to take
water, under the Civil Rights Protection Act, and the necessity to uphold
the constitutional mandate of abolishing untouchability and its practice
in any form was emphasised.
xxx xxx xxx
21. The  Constitution  through  its  Preamble,  Fundamental  Rights  and
Directive Principles created a secular State based on the principle of
equality and non-discrimination, striking a balance between the rights of
the individuals and the duty and commitment of the State to establish an
egalitarian social order. Dr K.M. Munshi contended on the floor of the
Constituent Assembly that “we want to divorce religion from personal
240law, from what may be called social relations, or from the rights of
parties as regards inheritance or succession. What have these things got
to do with religion, I fail to understand? We are in a stage where we must
unify and consolidate the nation by every means without interfering with
religious practices . If, however, in the past, religious practices have been
so construed as to cover the whole field of life, we have reached a point
when we must put our foot down and say that these matters are not
religion, they are purely matters for secular legislation. Religion must be
restricted to spheres which legitimately appertain to religion, and the rest
of life must be regulated, unified and modified in such a manner that we
may evolve, as early as possible, a strong and consolidated nation ” [Vide:
Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. VII, pp. 356-58].
xxx xxx xxx
26. Human rights are derived from the dignity and worth inherent in the
human  person.  Human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  have  been
reiterated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Democracy,
development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
are interdependent and have mutual reinforcement.  The human rights
for women, including girl child are, therefore, inalienable, integral and an
indivisible  part  of  universal  human  rights .  The  full  development  of
personality and fundamental freedoms and equal participation by women
in  political,  social,  economic  and  cultural  life  are  concomitants  for
national development, social and family stability and growth — cultural,
social and economical. All forms of discrimination on grounds of gender
is violative of fundamental freedoms and human rights . Convention for
Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (for short,
“CEDAW”) was ratified by the UNO on 18-12-1979 and the Government
of India had ratified as an active participant on 19-6-1993 acceded to
CEDAW and reiterated that discrimination against women violates the
principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity and it is an
obstacle to the participation on equal terms with men in the political,
social, economic and cultural life of their country; it hampers the growth
of the personality from society and family, making more difficult for the
full development of potentialities of women in the service of the respective
countries and of humanity.”
Reference  was  also  made  to  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  the  John
Vallamattom case9, wherefrom learned counsel for the petitioner highlighted
the following observations:
“42. Article  25  merely  protects  the  freedom  to  practise  rituals  and
ceremonies etc. which are only the integral parts of the religion. Article
25 of the Constitution of India will, therefore, not have any application in
the instant case .
xxx xxx xxx
24144. Before I part with the case, I would like to state that Article 44
provides  that  the  State  shall  endeavour  to  secure  for  the  citizens  a
uniform  civil  code  throughout  the  territory  of  India .  The  aforesaid
provision is based on the premise that there is no necessary connection
between religious and personal law in a civilized society. Article 25 of the
Constitution confers freedom of conscience and free profession, practice
and propagation of religion. The aforesaid two provisions viz. Articles 25
and 44 show that the former guarantees religious freedom whereas the
latter divests religion from social relations and personal law. It is no
matter of doubt that marriage, succession and the like matters of a
secular character cannot be brought within the guarantee enshrined
under  Articles  25  and  26  of  the  Constitution.  Any legislation  which
brings succession and the like matters of secular character within the
ambit  of  Articles  25  and  26  is  a  suspect  legislation,  although  it  is
doubtful whether the American doctrine of suspect legislation is followed
in this country . In Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India  (1995) 3 SCC 635 it
was held that marriage, succession and like matters of secular character
cannot be brought within the guarantee enshrined under Articles 25 and
26 of the Constitution.  It is a matter of regret that Article 44 of the
Constitution has not been given effect to. Parliament is still to step in for
framing a common civil code in the country. A common civil code will
help the cause of national integration by removing the contradictions
based on ideologies .”
Last of all, our attention was drawn to the Masilamani Mudaliar case16,
wherefrom reliance was placed on the following:
“15. It is seen that if after the Constitution came into force, the right to
equality  and  dignity  of  person  enshrined  in  the  Preamble  of  the
Constitution, Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles which are a
trinity intended to remove discrimination or disability on grounds only of
social status or gender, removed the pre-existing impediments that stood
in  the  way  of  female  or  weaker  segments  of  the  society .  In S.R.
Bommai v. Union  of  India  (1994)  3  SCC  1  this  Court  held  that  the
Preamble is part of the basic structure of the Constitution.  Handicaps
should be removed only under rule of law to enliven the trinity of justice,
equality and liberty with dignity of person . The basic structure permeates
equality of status and opportunity. The personal laws conferring inferior
status on women is anathema to equality. Personal laws are derived not
from the Constitution but from the religious scriptures. The laws thus
derived must be consistent with the Constitution lest they become void
under Article 13 if they violate fundamental rights. Right to equality is a
fundamental  right.  Parliament,  therefore,  has  enacted  Section  14  to
remove pre-existing disabilities fastened on the Hindu female limiting her
right to property without full ownership thereof. The discrimination is
sought to be remedied by Section 14(1) enlarging the scope of acquisition
of the property by a Hindu female appending an explanation with it .”
242168.We have  given  our thoughtful  consideration to  the submissions
noticed  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs.   We  are  of  the  view,  that  in  the
determination of the matter canvassed, the true purport and substance of
Articles 25 and 44  have to be understood.  We shall now endeavour to deal
with the above provisions.
169.During the course of hearing our attention has been drawn to the
Constituent Assembly debates, with reference to Article 25 (-draft Article
19).  The debates reveal that the members of the Constituent Assembly
understood a clear distinction between ‘personal law’ and the ‘civil code’.
‘Personal law’ was understood as based on the practices of members of
communities.  It was to be limited to the community itself, and would not
affect members of other communities.  The ‘civil code’ on the other hand,
had an unlimited reach.  The ‘civil code’ was understood to apply to every
citizen of the land, to whatever community he may belong.  So far as
‘personal law’ is concerned, it was recognized as arising out of, practices
followed by members of particular communities, over the ages.  The only
member of the Assembly, who made a presentation during the debates
(-Mohammed Ismail Sahib) stated, “This practice of following ‘personal law’
has been there amongst the people for ages.  What we want under this
amendment is that that practice should not be disturbed now and I want
only the continuance of a practice that has been going on among the people
for ages past …..  Under this amendment what I want this House to accept
is that when we speak of the State doing anything with reference to the
secular aspect of religion, the question of personal law shall not be brought
243in and it shall not be affected. ….. The question of professions, practicing
and propagating one’s faith is a right which the human being had from the
very beginning of time and that has been recognized as an inalienable right
of every human being, not only in this land, but the world over and I think
that nothing should be done to affect that right of man as a human being.
That part of the article as it stands is properly worded and it should stand
as it is.”  It is apparent, that the position expressed in the  Sarla Mudgal
case40,  clearly  reiterates  the  above  exposition  during  the  Constituent
Assembly debates.  The response to the above statement (-of Mohammed
Ismail Sahib), was delivered by Laksnmikanta Mitra, who observed, “ This
article 19 of the Draft Constitution confers on all persons the right to
profess, practise and propagate any religion they like but this right has
been circumscribed by certain conditions which the State would be free to
impose in the interests of public morality, public order and public health
and also in so far as the right conferred here does not conflict in any way
with the other provisions elaborated under this part of the Constitution.
Some of my Friends argued that this right ought not to be permitted in this
Draft Constitution for the simple reason that we have declared time and
again that this is going to be a secular State and as such practice of religion
should not be permitted as a fundamental right. It has been further argued
that by conferring the additional right to propagate a particular faith or
religion the door is opened for all manner of troubles and conflicts which
would eventually paralyse the normal life of the State. We would say at once
that this conception of a secular State is wholly wrong. By secular State, as
244we  understand  it,  is  meant  that  the  State  is  not  going  to  make  any
discrimination whatsoever on the ground of religion or community against
any person professing any particular form of religious faith. This means in
essence  that  no  particular  religion  in  the  State  will  receive  any  State
patronage whatsoever. The State is not going to establish, patronise or
endow any particular religion to the exclusion of or in preference to others
and that no citizen in the State will have any preferential treatment or will
be  discriminated  against  simply  on  the  ground  that  he  professed  a
particular form of religion. ….. At the same time we must be very careful to
see that this land of ours we do not deny to anybody the right not only to
profess  or  practise  but  also  to  propagate  any  particular  religion.
…..Therefore I feel that the Constitution has rightly provided for this not
only as a right but also as a fundamental right. In the exercise of this
fundamental right every community inhabiting this State professing any
religion will have equal right and equal facilities to do whatever it likes in
accordance with its religion provided it does not clash with the conditions
laid down here.”
170.The debates in the Constituent Assembly with reference to Article
25, leave no room for any doubt, that the framers of the Constitution were
firm in making ‘personal law’ a part of the fundamental rights.  With the
liberty to the State to provide for social reform.  It is also necessary to notice
at this stage, that the judgment in the Valsamma Paul case20, cannot be the
basis for consideration in the present controversy, because it did not deal
with  issues  arising  out  of  ‘personal  law’  which  enjoy  a  constitutional
245protection.  What also needs to be recorded is, that the judgment in the
John Vallamattom case9, expresses that the matters of the nature, need to
be dealt with through legislation, and as such, the view expressed in the
above judgment cannot be of any assistance to further the petitioners’
cause.
171.The debates of the Constituent Assembly with reference to Article
44, are also relevant. We may refer to draft Article 25 (which came to be
enacted as Article 44).  The Article requires the State to endeavour to secure
a uniform ‘civil code’.  A member who debated the provision during the
deliberations  of  the  Constituent  Assembly,  canvassed  that  groups  and
sections of religious denominations be given the right to adhere to their own
personal law (-Mohamed Ismail Sahib), as it was felt, that interference in
‘personal  law’  would  amount  to  interfering  with  “…the  way  of  life  and
religion of the people…”.  It was also argued (-by Naziruddin Ahmad), that
what was extended as a protection through Article 25 (-draft Article 19),
namely, “…all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the
right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion…”, was sought to be
taken away via Article 44.  The position highlighted, was that all religious
practices should remain, beyond the purview of law.  One member of the
Constituent Assembly (-Mahbood Ali Baig Sahib Bahadur), said that the
uniform civil code, in the Article, should not include ‘personal law’.  He
refuted the suggestions of M.Ananthasayanam Ayyangar by asserting, that
practices  of Muslims, in vogue  for 1350 years  could not be altered.  
Another member – Pocker Sahib Bahadur, supported the suggestion of
246Mohamed Ismail Sahib.  The question he posed was “…whether by the
freedom we have obtained for this country, are we going to give up the
freedom  of  conscience  and  that  freedom  of  religion  practices  and  that
freedom of following ones own personal law…”  But all these submissions
were  rejected.   All  this  leads  to  the  clear  understanding,  that  the
Constitution requires the State to provide for a uniform civil code, to remedy
and assuage, the maladies expressed in the submissions advanced by the
learned Attorney General.  
172.There can be no doubt, that the ‘personal law’ has been elevated to
the stature of a fundamental  right in the Constitution.  And as such,
‘personal law’ is enforceable as it is.  All constitutional Courts, are the
constitutional guardians of all the Fundamental Rights (– included in Part
III of the Constitution).  It is therefore the constitutional duty of all Courts
to protect, preserve and enforce, all fundamental rights, and not the other
way around.  It is judicially unthinkable for a Court, to accept any prayer to
declare as unconstitutional (-or unacceptable in law), for any reason or
logic, what the Constitution declares as a fundamental right.  Because, in
accepting the prayer(s), this Court would be denying the rights expressly
protected under Article 25. 
173.It is not possible to adopt concepts emerging from the American
Constitution, over the provisions of the Indian Constitution. It is therefore
not possible to refer to substantive due process, as the basis of the decision
of the present controversy, when there are express provisions provided for,
on the matter in hand, under the Indian  Constitution.  It is also not
247possible, to  read into  the Constitution, what the Constituent Assembly
consciously and thoughtfully excluded (-or, to overlook provisions expressly
incorporated).   One  cannot  make  a  reference  to  decisions  of  the  U.S.
Supreme Court, though there would be no difficulty of their being taken
into  consideration  for  persuasive  effect,  in  support  of  a  cause,  in
consonance with the provisions of the Constitution of India and the laws.
In fact, this Court is bound by the judgments of the Supreme Court of
India,  which  in  terms  of  Article  141  of  the  Constitution,  are  binding
declarations of law.
174.The prayer made to this Court by those representing the petitioners’
cause, on the ground that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is violative of the
concept of constitutional morality cannot be acceded to, and is accordingly
declined.
VIII. Reforms to ‘personal law’ in India:
175.In our consideration, it is also necessary to briefly detail legislation
in India with regard to matters strictly pertaining to ‘personal law’, and
particularly to  the issues  of  marriage and  divorce, i.e., matters  strictly
within the confines of ‘personal law’. 
176(i).Reference in this context may first of all be made to the Divorce Act,
1869.  The Statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, delineates the
purpose that was sought to be achieved through the enactment.  Relevant
part thereof, is reproduced hereunder:-
“Statement of objects and reasons
The  object  of  Indian  Divorce  Bill  is  to  place  the  Matrimonial    Law
administered  by  the  High  Courts,  in  the  exercise  of  their  original
248jurisdiction, on the same footing as the Matrimonial Law administered
by the court for Divorce and   Matrimonial Causes in England .
The 9th Section of the Act of Parliament for establishing High Courts of
Judicature in India (24 and 25 Vic., C.104) provides that the High Courts
shall exercise such Matrimonial Jurisdiction as Her Majesty by Letters
Patent shall grant and direct. Under the authority  thus conferred by
Parliament, the 35th Section of the Letters Patent, constituting the High
Courts of Judicature, provides as follows:—
""And we do further ordain that the said High Court of Judicature at
Fort William in    Bengal shall have jurisdiction in matters matrimonial
between our subjects professing the    Christian religion, and that such
jurisdiction shall extend to the local limits within which the    Supreme
Court now has Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction . Provided always that nothing
herein contained shall be held to interfere with the exercise of any
Jurisdiction in matters matrimonial by any court not established by
Royal Charter within the said Presidency lawfully possessed thereof.""
In the Despatch of the Secretary of State transmitting the Letters Patent
the 33rd and 34th paragraphs are to the following effect:—
“33.  Her Majesty's Government are desirous of placing the Christian
subjects of the Crown within the Presidency in the same position under
the High Court, as to matters   matrimonial in general as they now are
under the Supreme Court, and this they believe to be effected by Clause
35 of the Charter. But they consider it expedient that the High Court
should   possess, in addition, the power of decreeing divorce which the
Supreme Court does not   possess, in other words, that the High Court
should  have  the  same  jurisdiction  as  the  Court    for  Divorce  and
Matrimonial Causes in England , established in virtue of the Act 20 and
21 Vic., C. 85, and in regard to which further provisions were made by 22
and 23 Vic., C.61, and 23 and 24 Vic., C.144. The Act of Parliament for
establishing the High Courts, however, does    not purport to give to the
Crown the power of importing into the Charter all the provisions of the
Divorce Court Act, and some of them, the Crown clearly could not so
import,  such,  for  instance,  as  those  which  prescribe  the  period  of
re-marriage,  and  those  which  exempt  from  punishment  clergymen
refusing to re-marry adulterers. All these are, in truth, matters for Indian
legislation, and I request that you will immediately take the subject into
your consideration, and introduce into your Council a Bill for conferring
upon the High Court, the jurisdiction and powers of the Divorce Court in
England, one of the provisions of which should be to give an appeal to the
Privy Council in those cases in which the Divorce Court Act gives an appeal
to the House of Lords.
34. The objects of the provision at the end of Clause 35 is to obviate any
doubt that may possibly arise as to whether, by vesting the High Court
with the powers of the Court for  Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in
England, it was intended to take away from the Courts within Divisions of
the Presidency, not established by Royal Charter, any jurisdiction which
they might have in matters matrimonial, as for instance in a suit for
249alimony  between  Armenians  or  Native  Christians.  With  any  such
jurisdiction it is not intended to interfere.""
In addition to the Act of Parliament mentioned by the Secretary of State as
regulating the jurisdiction of the England Divorce Court the Statute 25 and
26 Vic., Ch.81 has been passed in the year just expired (1862). The object of
this statute is to render perpetual 23 and 24 Vic., Ch. 144 the duration of
which had been originally limited to two years.
The draft of a Bill has been prepared to give effect to the Secretary of State’s
instructions,  but some variations from the English Statutes in respect of
Procedure have been adopted.
With  a  view  to  uniformity  in  practice  in  the  several  branches  of
jurisdiction,  the  Bill  provides that the Procedure of the Code of Civil
Procedure shall be followed, instead of the Rules of Her Majesty's Court for
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in England, and it omits the provision in
20 and 21 Vic., Ch. 85 respecting the occasional trial of questions of fact by
juries.”
(ii)The Divorce Act, 1869 provided for the grounds for dissolution of
marriage in Section 10 thereof.  The same is extracted hereunder:-
“10.Grounds for dissolution of marriage .-(1) Any marriage solemnized,
whether  before  or  after  the  commencement  of  the  Indian  Divorce
(Amendment) Act, 2001, may, on a petition presented to the District
Court either by the husband or the wife, be dissolved on the ground that
since the solemnization of the marriage, the respondent —
(i) has committed adultery ; or
(ii) has ceased to be Christian  by conversion to another religion; or
(iii) has been incurably of unsound  mind for a continuous period of not
less  than  two  years  immediately  preceding  the  presentation  of  the
petition; or
(iv) has, for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the
presentation of the petition, been suffering from a virulent and incurable
form of leprosy ; or
(v) has, for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the
presentation of the petition, been  suffering from venereal disease in a
communicable form ; or
(vi) has not been heard of as being alive  for a period of seven years or
more  by  those  persons  who  would  naturally  have  heard  of  the
respondent if the respondent had been alive; or
(vii) has wilfully refused to consummate the marriage  and the marriage
has not therefore been consummated; or
(viii) has failed to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights
for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of the decree
against the respondent; or
(ix) has  deserted  the  petitioner  for  at  least  two  years  immediately
preceding the presentation of the petition; or
250(x) has treated the petitioner with such cruelty  as to cause a reasonable
apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it would be harmful or
injurious for the petitioner to live with the respondent.
(2) A wife may also present a petition for the dissolution of her marriage
on the ground that the husband has, since the solemnization of the
marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality.”
(iii)In addition to the above, consequent upon a further amendment,
Section 10A was added thereto, to provide for dissolution of marriage by
consent.  What is sought to be highlighted is, that it required legislation to
provide for divorce amongst the followers of the Christian faith in India.
The instant legislation provided for grounds on which Christian husbands
and wives could obtain divorce.
177 (i).Parsis in India, are the followers of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster.
The Parsis, are stated to have migrated from Iran to India, to avoid religious
persecution by the Muslims.  Parsis in India were governed in the matter of
marriage and divorce by their ‘personal law’.  For the first time in 1865, the
Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act was passed.  The same was substituted by
the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936 after substantial amendments to
the original enactment.  The statement of objects and reasons of the Parsi
Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936 clearly demonstrates the above position.
The same is reproduced below:-
“Statement of objects and reasons
The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act at present in force was passed in
1865. Since then circumstances have greatly altered and to some extent
there has also been a change in the sentiments and views of the Parsi
community. Hence a necessity for some change in the law has been felt
for years.  The Parsi Central Association took up the question in 1923
and  appointed  a  Sub-Committee  to  suggest  amendments .  The
Sub-Committee submitted a report which the Association got printed and
circulated  for  opinion  to  most  other  Parsi  Associations  as  well  as
prominent members of the community both in Bombay and outside.
Many suggestions were made, and among them by the Trustees of the
251Bombay  Parsi  Panchayat  who  had  the  advantage  of  seeing  the
suggestions of others. The Central Association adopted the suggestions of
the Panchayat Trustees and reprinted the whole and again circulated it.
Fresh suggestions were thereupon made in the press, on the platform, by
associations and individuals. These were fully considered by the Trustees
as well as the Association and the present draft is the result . On the
whole it represents, the views of the great majority of the community,
and has been approved by leading Parsis like Sir Dinshaw E. Wacha and
the late Rt. Hon. Sir Dinshaw F. Mulla.”
(ii)Chapter II of the aforesaid enactment, deals with the subject of
marriages between Parsis.  Section 3 provides for requisites of a valid Parsi
marriage.  Section 6 denotes a requirement of a certificate of marriage.
Chapter IV provides for a variety of matrimonial suits, wherein Section 30
deals with suits for nullity.  Section 31 deals with suits for dissolution of
marriage.  The grounds for divorce are set out in Section 32, which is
reproduced herein below:-
“32.Grounds for divorce .-  Any married person may sue for divorce on
any one or more of the following  grounds, namely:—
 (a) that the marriage has not been consummated within one year after its
solemnization owing to the wilful refusal of the defendant to consummate
it;
(b) that the defendant at the time of the marriage was of unsound mind
and has been habitually so up to the date of the suit:
Provided that divorce shall not be granted on this ground, unless the
plaintiff; (1) was ignorant of the fact  at the time of the marriage, and (2)
has filed the suit within three years from the date of the marriage;
(bb) that the defendant has been incurable of the unsound mind for a
period of two years or upwards immediately preceding the filing of the
suit or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from mental
disorder of such kind and to such an extent that the plaintiff cannot
reasonable be expected to live with the defendant.
Explanation.- In this clause,-
(a)  the expression “mental disorder” means mental illness, arrested or
incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder or any other
disorder or disability of mind and includes schizophrenia;
(b) the expression “psychopathic disorder” means a persistent disorder of
disability of mind (whether or not including subnormality of intelligence)
which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct
on  the  part  of  the  defendant,  and  whether  or  not  it  requires  or  is
susceptible to medical treatment;
252(c) that  the defendant was at the time of marriage pregnant by some
person other than the plaintiff :
Provided that divorce shall not be granted on this ground, unless: (1) the
plaintiff was at the time of the marriage ignorant of the fact alleged, (2)
the suit has been filed within two years of the date of marriage, and (3)
marital intercourse has not taken place after the plaintiff came to know
of the fact;
(d)   that  the defendant has since the marriage committed adultery or
fornication or bigamy or rape or an unnatural offence :
Provided that divorce shall not be granted on this ground if the suit has
been filed more than two years after the plaintiff came to know of the
fact;
(dd) that the defendant has since the solemnization  of the marriage
treated the plaintiff with cruelty or has behaved in such a way as to
render it in the judgment of the Court improper to compel the plaintiff to
live with the defendant:
Provided that in every suit for divorce on this ground it shall be in the
discretion of the Court whether it should grant a decree for divorce or for
judicial separation only;
(e) that the defendant has since the marriage voluntarily caused grievous
hurt to the plaintiff or has infected the plaintiff with venereal disease or,
where the defendant is the husband, has compelled the wife to submit
herself to prostitution : 
Provided that divorce shall not be granted on this ground if the suit has
been filed more than two years (i) after the infliction of the grievous hurt,
or (ii) after the plaintiff came to know of the infection, or (iii) after the last
act of compulsory prostitution;
(f)  that  the defendant is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for
seven years or more for an offence as defined in the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860):
Provided that divorce shall not be granted on this ground, unless the
defendant has prior to the filing of the suit undergone at least one year's
imprisonment out of the said period;
(g)  that the defendant has deserted the plaintiff  for at least two years;
(h) that an order has been passed against the defendant by a Magistrate
awarding separate maintenance to the plaintiff, and the parties have not
had marital intercourse for one year or more since such decree or order ;
(j) that the defendant has ceased to be a Parsi by conversion to another
religion;
Provided that divorce shall not be granted on this ground if the suit has
been filed more than two years after the  plaintiff came to know of the
fact.
(iii)In addition to the above, Section 32B introduced by way of an
amendment,  provides  for  divorce  by  mutual  consent,  and  Section  34
253provides for suits for judicial separation, and  Section 36 provides for suits
for restitution of conjugal rights.
178(i). The Special Marriage Act, 1872 provided for inter-faith marriages.
The same came to be replaced by the Special Marriage Act, 1954.  The
statement of objects and reasons thereof is reproduced hereunder:-
“Statement of objects and reasons
This Bill revises and seeks to replace the Special Marriage Act of 1872 so
as to provide a special form of marriage which can be taken advantage of
by any person in India and by all Indian nationals in foreign countries
irrespective of the faith which either party to the marriage may profess.
The parties may observe any ceremonies for the solemnization of their
marriage, but certain formalities are prescribed before the marriage can
be registered by the Marriage Officers . For the benefit of Indian citizens
abroad, the Bill provides for the appointment of Diplomatic and Consular
Officers as Marriage Officers for solemnizing and registering marriages
between citizens of India in a foreign country.
2.  Provision is also sought to be made for permitting persons who are
already married under other forms of marriage to register their marriages
under this Act and thereby avail themselves of these provisions .
3.  The  bill  is  drafted  generally  on  the  lines  of  the  existing  Special
Marriage Act of 1872 and the notes on clauses attached hereto explain
some of the changes made in the Bill in greater detail.”
(ii) The subject of solemnization of special marriages, is provided for in
Section 4 of the above enactment.  Section 4 lays down the conditions
related to solemnization of special marriages, which requires a notice of the
parties intending to get married, the procedure and conditions whereof are
contained in Section 5.  The provisions of the enactment require, entering a
copy of the notice in the ‘marriage notice book’, and the publication thereof
by affixation of the copy thereof to some conspicuous place in the office of
marriage officer.  Objections to the contemplated marriage can be preferred
under Section 7.  The manner in which the objections have to be dealt with
is provided for in Sections 8, 9 and 10.  Consequent upon the completion of
254the  formalities  postulated  in  Chapter  II  of  the  enactment,  parties  are
permitted to solemnize their marriage, for which the marriage officer shall
issue  a certificate  of marriage, that would  be considered as conclusive
evidence of the fact that parties are married under the provisions of the
Special Marriages Act, 1954.  
(iii)Parties who have entered into a matrimonial alliance by way of
ceremonies of marriage conducted under different faiths, and have been
living together,  are  also  permitted  to  register  their  marriage  under  the
Special Marriage Act, 1954, under Section 15 thereof.  
(iv)Chapter IV of the enactment deals with consequences of marriage
under the Act.  Chapter V provides the remedies of restitution of conjugal
rights  and  judicial  separation.   Chapter  VI  defines  void  and  voidable
marriages, and provides for nullity of marriage and divorce.  Section 27
included in Chapter VI incorporates the grounds for divorce, which are
extracted hereunder:-
“27.Divorce.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and to the rules
made thereunder, a petition for divorce may be presented to the district
court  either  by  the  husband  or  the  wife  on  the  ground  that  the
respondent— 
(a) has,  after the solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual
intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse ; or
(b) has deserted the petitioner  for a continuous period of not less than
two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or
(c) is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment  for seven years or more for
an offence as defined in the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860);
(d) has since the solemnization of the marriage treated the petitioner with
cruelty; or 
(e)has  been  incurably  of  unsound  mind ,  or  has  been  suffering
continuously or intermittently from mental disorder  of such a kind and
to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to
live with the respondent. 
Explanation.—In this clause,—
255(a) the expression “mental disorder” means mental illness, arrested or
incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder or any other
disorder or disability of mind and includes schizophrenia;
(b) the expression “psychopathic disorder” means a persistent disorder or
disability of mind (whether or not including sub-normality of intelligence)
which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct
on the part of the respondent, and whether or not it requires or is
susceptible to medical treatment; or
(f)has been suffering from venereal disease in a communicable form;
or
(g)has been suffering from leprosy, the disease not having been contacted
from the petitioner; or
(h)has not been heard of as being alive for a period of seven years or
more  by  those  persons  who  would  naturally  have  heard  of  the
respondent if the respondent had been alive; 
Explanation.—In  this  sub-section,  the  expression  “desertion”  means
desertion of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage without
reasonable cause and without the consent or against the wish of such
party, and includes the wilful neglect of the petitioner by the other party
to the marriage, and its grammatical variations and cognate expressions
shall be construed accordingly; 
(1A)A wife may also present a petition for divorce to the district court on
the ground,—
(i)that her husband has, since the solemnization of the marriage, been
guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality ;
(ii)that  in  a  suit  under  section  18  of  the  Hindu  Adoptions  and
Maintenance Act, 1956 (78 of 1956), or in a proceeding under section
125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) (or under the
corresponding section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898) (5 of
1898), a decree or order, as the case may be, has been passed against
the husband awarding maintenance to the wife notwithstanding that she
was living apart  and that since the passing of such decree or order,
cohabitation between the parties has not been resumed for one year or
upwards. 
(2)  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  Act  and  to  the  rules  made
thereunder, either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or
after the commencement of the Special Marriage (Amendment) Act, 1970
(29 of 1970), may present a petition for divorce to the district court on
the ground—
(i)that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the
parties to the marriage for a period of one year or upwards  after the
passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceeding to which they
were parties; or
(ii)that there has been  no restitution of conjugal rights as between the
parties to the marriage for a period of one year or upwards after the
passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in a proceeding to
which they were parties.”
256In addition to the above, Section 28 provides for divorce by mutual consent.
179.The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969 followed the Special Marriage Act,
1954.  It was enacted on account of uncertainty of law related to foreign
marriages.  The statement of objects and reasons of the Foreign Marriage
Act,  1969 expresses the holistic  view,  which led  to  the  passing of  the
legislation.  The same is reproduced below:-
“Statement of objects and reasons
This  Bill  seeks  to  implement  the  Twenty-third  Report  of  the  Law
Commission on the law relating to foreign marriages. There is, at present
considerable uncertainty as to the law on the subject, as the existing
legislation touches only the fringes of the subject and the matter is
governed  by  principles  of  private  international  law  which  are  by  no
means well-settled, and which cannot readily be applied to a country
such  as  ours  in  which  different  marriage  laws  apply  to  different
communities.  The  Special  Marriage  Act,  1954  sought  to  remove  the
uncertainty to some extent by providing that marriages abroad between
citizens of India who are domiciled in India might be solemnized under it .
In the course of the debates in relation to that Act in Parliament, it was
urged that a provision should be made for marriages abroad where one of
the parties alone is an Indian citizen. In this context, an assurance was
given  that  Government  would,  after  careful  consideration,  introduce
comprehensive  legislation  on  the  subject  of  foreign  marriages.  The
present Bill is the outcome of that assurance .
(2) The Bill is modelled on the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and the
existing English  and Australian  Legislation  on the  subject of foreign
marriages, subject to certain important modifications rendered necessary
by the peculiar conditions obtaining in our country.
The following are the salient features of the Bill:—
(i) It provides for an enabling form of marriage more or less on the same
lines as the Special Marriage Act, 1954 which can be availed of outside
India where one of the parties to the marriage is an Indian citizen ; the
form of marriage thus provided being not in supersession of, but only in
addition  to  or  as  an  alternative  to,  any  other  form  that  might  be
permissible to the parties.
(ii) It seeks to lay down certain rules in respect of capacity of parties and
conditions of validity of marriage  and also provides for registration of
marriage on lines similar to those in the Special Marriage Act, 1954.
(iii) The  provisions  of  the  Special  Marriage  Act,  1954,  in  regard  to
matrimonial  reliefs  are  sought  to  be  made  applicable,  with  suitable
modifications, not only to marriages solemnized or registered under the
257proposed legislation, but also to other marriages solemnized abroad to
which a citizen of India is a party .”
(ii)Chapter  II  of  the  Foreign  Marriage  Act,  1969  provides  for  the
solemnization  of  the  foreign  marriages.   Section  4  contained  therein
expresses the conditions relating to solemnization of foreign marriages.  The
notice  of  an  intended  marriage  is  provided  for  in  Section  5.   The
incorporation of the said marriage in the ‘marriage notice book’ is contained
in Section 6.  The publication of such notice is provided for in Section 7.
Objections  to  the  proposed  marriage  can  be  filed  under  Section  8.
Consequent upon the fulfillment of the conditions and determination by the
marriage  officer,  the  place  and  form  of  solemnization  of  marriage  are
detailed in Section 13, whereupon, the marriage officer is required to enter
a certificate of marriage, which is accepted as evidence of the fact that the
marriage between the parties had been solemnized.  Chapter III mandates
the registration of foreign marriages, solemnized under other laws.  Section
17 provides for necessary requirements therefor.  
(v)It would be relevant to mention, that matrimonial reliefs as are
provided for under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 (- which are contained in
Chapters IV, V and VI thereof) have been adopted for marriages registered
under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969 (-see paragraph 179 above).
180.Muslims are followers of Islam.  Muslims  consider the Quran their
holy book.  For their personal relations, they follow the Muslim ‘personal
law’ – ‘Shariat’.  The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937,
as  already  noticed  above  provided,  “the  rule  of  decision”  in  matters
pertaining, inter alia, to marriage, dissolution of marriage including talaq,
258ila, zihar, lian, khula and mubaraat would be the Muslim ‘personal law’ –
‘Shariat’, and not, any custom or usage to the contrary.  It is therefore, that
by a statutory intervention, customs and usages in conflict with Muslim
‘personal  law’,  were  done  away  with,  in  connection  with  ‘personal  law’
matters, in relation to Muslims.  The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act,
1939  provided,  grounds  for  dissolution  of  marriage  to  Muslim  women,
under Section 2 of the above enactment.  Details with reference to 1937 and
1939 legislations, have already been narrated, in Part IV – Legislation in
India, in the field of Muslim ‘personal law’.  Reference may, therefore, be
made to Part IV above.
181 (i). The  law  of  marriage  and  divorce  amongst  Hindus,  has  had  a
chequered  history.   A  marriage,  according  to  Hindu  law,  is  a  holy
sacrament, and not a contract (as is the case of Muslims).  Originally there
were eight forms of Hindu marriages, four of which were considered regular
– and the rest irregular.  The choice of marriage, was limited only to one’s
own religion and caste.  Polygamy was permitted amongst Hindus, but not
polyandry.   Widow marriage was also not permitted.  Legislation in respect
of Hindu marriages commenced in 1829 when Sati was abolished by law.
In 1856, Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act, legalized the marriage of Hindu
widows.  In 1860, the Indian Penal Code made polygamy a criminal offence.
In 1866, Native Converts Marriage Dissolution Act facilitated divorce for
Hindus, who had adopted the Christian faith.  In 1872, Special Marriage
Act was enacted, but it excluded Hindus.  In 1869, the Indian Divorce Act
was passed, but this too remained inapplicable to Hindus.  In 1909, the
259Anand Marriage Act legalized marriages amongst Sikhs (called – Anand).  In
1923, by an amendment to the Special Marriage Act, inter-religious civil
marriages between Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains were legalized.  In
1937, the Arya Marriage Validation Act legalized the inter-caste marriages,
and marriages with converts to Hinduism, among the followers of Arya
Samaj.   In  1949,  Hindu  Marriages  Validity  Act  legalized  inter-religious
marriages.  
(ii)The Hindu Marriage Act, was passed in 1955.  Section 5 of the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, provides for the conditions of a valid Hindu
marriage.  Section 7 incorporates the ceremonies required for  a Hindu
marriage.  Section 8 provides for the requirement of registration of Hindu
marriages.   The  remedies  of  restitution  of  conjugal  rights  and  judicial
separation, are provided for in Sections 9 and 10 respectively.  Provisions
related to nullity of marriages and divorce are contained in Sections 11 and
12.  The  grounds of divorce have been expressed in Section 13, which is
reproduced below:-
“13.Divorce.- (1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the
commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the
husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground

intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse ; or 
(ia) has, after the solemnization of the marriage,  treated the petitioner
with cruelty; or 
(ib) has deserted the petitioner  for a continuous period of not less than
two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or

desertion of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage without
reasonable cause and without the consent or against the wish of such
party, and includes the willful neglect of the petitioner by the other party
to the marriage, and its grammatical variations and cognate expression
shall be construed accordingly. 
(1-A) Either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the
commencement  of  this  Act,  may  also  present  a  petition  for  the
dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground-

corresponding Section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (5 of
1898), a decree or order, as the case may be, has been passed against
the husband awarding maintenance to the wife notwithstanding that she
261was living apart and that since the passing of such decree or order ,
cohabitation between the parties has not been resumed for one year or
upwards; or 
(iv)  that her marriage (whether consummated or not) was solemnized
before she attained the age of fifteen years and she  has repudiated the
marriage after attaining that age but before attaining the age of eighteen
years. 
Explanation.- This clause applies whether the marriage was solemnized
before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment)
Act, 1976 (68 of 1976). ”
By subsequent amendments, Section 13B was introduced, which provides
for divorce by mutual consent.
182.A perusal of the details pertaining to legislation in India with regard
to  matters  pertaining  to  ‘personal  law’,  and  particularly  to  issues  of
marriage and divorce for different religious communities reveals, that all
issues governed by ‘personal law’, were only altered by way of legislation.
There is not a singular instance of judicial intervention, brought to our
notice except a few judgments rendered by High Courts (-for details, refer to
Part-6 – Judicial pronouncements, on the subject of ‘talaq-e-biddat’).  These
judgments, however, attempted the interpretative course, as against an
invasive  one.  The  details  depicted  above  relate  to  marriage  between
Christians, Parsis, inter-faith marriages, Muslims and Hindus, including
Buddhists,  Sikhs  and  Jains.   The  unbroken  practice  during  the
pre-independence period, and the post independence period – under the
Constitution,  demonstrates  a  clear  and  unambiguous  course,  namely,
reform  in  the  matter  of  marriage  and  divorce  (which  are  integral
components  of  ‘personal  law’)  was  only  introduced  through  legislation.
Therefore in continuation of the conclusion already recorded, namely, that
it is the constitutional duty of all courts to preserve and protect ‘personal
262law’  as  a  fundamental  right,  any  change  thereof,  has  to  be  only  by
legislation under Articles 25(2) and 44, read with entry 5 of the Concurrent
List contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
IX.Impact  of  international  conventions  and  declarations  on  ‘talaq-e-
biddat’:
183.A number of learned counsel who assisted us in support of the
petitioners’ cause were emphatic, that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was
rendered impermissible, as soon as, India accepted to be a signatory to
international conventions and declarations, with which the practice was in
clear  conflict.   It  was  submitted,  that  continuation  of  the  practice  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’,  sullied the  image  of  the country internationally, as  the
nation was seen internationally as a defaulters to those conventions and
declarations.   It  was  pointed  out,  that  by  not  consciously  barring
‘talaq-e-biddat’, and by knowingly allowing the practice to be followed, India
was seen as persisting and propagating, what the international community
considers  abhorrent.   It  was  therefore  submitted,  that  the  practice  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ be declared as unacceptable in law, since it was in conflict
with international conventions and declarations.
184.We may, in the first instance, briefly point out to the submissions
advanced by Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel.  She placed reliance
on  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  adopted  by the  United
Nations General Assembly as far back as in 1948.  She drew our attention
to the preamble thereof, to emphasise, that the declaration recognized the
inherent dignity of human beings as equal and inalienable.  She highlighted
263the fact, that the declaration envisioned equal rights for men and women –
both in dignity and rights. For this, she placed reliance on Article 1 of the
Declaration.  Referring to Article 2, she asserted, that there could be no
discrimination on the basis of sex.  Learned senior counsel evoked the
conscience of this Court, to give effect to the declaration, to which India was
a signatory.  This Court’s attention was also invited to the International
Conventions  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  Rights  (ICESCR).   The
pointed aim whereof was to eliminate all forms of discrimination, including
discrimination on the basis of sex.  It was highlighted, that the International
Conventions Bill for Rights for Women was ratified by 189 States.  Referring
to Article 1 thereof, it was submitted, that the objective of the convention
was  to  eradicate  discrimination  against  women.   Having  signed  the
aforesaid convention, it was submitted, that it was the obligation of all the
signatory States, to take positive and effective steps for elimination of all
facets  of  discrimination  against  women.   It  was  highlighted,  that
‘talaq-e-biddat’ was the worst form of discrimination, against women.
185.Learned Attorney General for India strongly supported the instant
contention.   It  was  his  pointed  assertion,  that  the  Indian  State  was
obligated to adhere the principles enshrined in international conventions.  It
was highlighted, that India was a founding member of the United Nations,
and was bound by its charter.  It was submitted, that gender equality as a
human  right,  had  been  provided  for  in  various  conventions  and
declarations.  We do not consider the necessity to repeat the submissions
canvassed at the hands of the learned Attorney General, who painstakingly
264adverted to the same, to support his prayer, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was a
practice which violated a number of conventions to which India was a
signatory.  Details in this behalf, have been recorded by us in paragraph 74,
while recording the submissions advanced by the learned Attorney General.
The same be read herein, in continuation of the submissions briefly noticed
above. 
186.We have considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the
petitioners,  pointedly  with  reference  to  international  conventions  and
declarations.   We  have  not  the  least  doubt,  that  the  Indian  State  is
committed to gender equality.  This is the clear mandate of Article 14 of the
Constitution.  India is also committed to eradicate discrimination on the
ground of sex.  Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, prohibit any kind of
discrimination on the basis of sex.  There is therefore no reason or necessity
while examining the issue of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, to fall back upon international
conventions and declarations.  The Indian Constitution itself provides for
the same.
187.The reason for us, not to accede to the submissions advanced at the
behest of those who support the petitioners’ cause, with pointed reference to
international conventions and declarations, is based on Article 25 of the
Constitution,  whereby  ‘personal  law’  of  all  religious  denominations,  is
sought  to  be  preserved.   The  protection  of  ‘personal  laws’  of  religious
sections, is elevated to the stature of a fundamental right, inasmuch as
Article 25 of the Constitution, which affords such protection to ‘personal
law’ is a part of Part III (– Fundamental Rights), of the Constitution.  It is
265therefore  apparent,  that  whilst  the  Constitution  of  India  supports  all
conventions  and  declarations  which  call  for  gender  equality,  the
Constitution preserves ‘personal law’ through which religious communities
and denominations have governed themselves, as an exception.
188.Our affirmation, that international conventions and declarations are
not binding to the extent they are in conflict with domestic laws, can be
traced from a series of judgments rendered by this Court on the subject.
Reference is being made to some of them herein below:
(i)  Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra  53  , 
The question that arose for consideration before this Court, in the instant
case was, whether an action of a superior against a sub-ordinate female
employee,  which  is  against  moral  sanctions  can  withstand  the  test  of
decency and modesty, not amounting to sexual harassment?  The question
that arose was, whether the allegation that a superior tried to molest an
inferior female employee at the work place, constituted an act unbecoming
of the conduct and behaviour expected from the superior?  And, whether an
inferior  female  employee,  has  recourse  to  a  remedial  action?   While
examining  the  above  proposition,  this  Court  relying  on  international
conventions and declarations arrived at the conclusion, that the same have
to be given effect to unless they were contrary to domestic laws, by holding
as under:
“26. There is no gainsaying that each incident of sexual harassment at
the place of work, results in violation of the fundamental right to gender
equality  and  the  right  to  life  and  liberty  —  the  two  most  precious
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India . As early as
in 1993, at the ILO Seminar held at Manila, it was recognized that sexual
53
266harassment  of  women  at  the  workplace  was  a  form  of  “gender
discrimination  against  women”.  In  our  opinion,  the  contents  of  the
fundamental  rights  guaranteed  in  our  Constitution  are  of  sufficient
amplitude  to  encompass  all    facets   of  gender  equality,  including
prevention of sexual harassment and abuse and the courts are under a
constitutional  obligation  to  protect  and  preserve  those  fundamental
rights.  That  sexual  harassment  of  a  female  at  the  place  of  work  is
incompatible with the dignity and honour of a female and needs to be
eliminated and that there can be no compromise with such violations,
admits of no debate. The message of international instruments such as
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women, 1979 (“CEDAW”) and the Beijing Declaration which directs all
State parties to take appropriate measures to prevent discrimination of
all forms against women besides taking steps to protect the honour and
dignity  of  women  is  loud  and  clear.  The  International  Covenant  on
Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  Rights  contains  several  provisions
particularly important for women. Article 7 recognises her right to fair
conditions of work and reflects that women shall not be subjected to
sexual harassment at the place of work which may vitiate the working
environment. These international instruments cast an obligation on the
Indian State to gender-sensitise its laws and the courts are under an
obligation to see that the message of the international instruments is not
allowed to be drowned . This Court has in numerous cases emphasised
that while discussing constitutional  requirements, court and  counsel
must  never  forget  the  core  principle  embodied  in  the  international
conventions and instruments and as far as possible, give effect to the
principles contained in those international instruments. The courts are
under an obligation to give due regard to international conventions and
norms  for  construing  domestic  laws,  more  so,  when  there  is  no
inconsistency between them and there is a void in domestic law . (See
with advantage —  Prem Shankar Shukla  v.  Delhi Admn. Mackinnon
Mackenzie  and  Co.  Ltd.  v.  Audrey  D’  Costa ;  Sheela  Barse v.  Secy.,
Children’s  Aid  Society  SCC  at  p.  54;  Vishaka v.  State  of  Rajasthan
People’s Union for Civil Liberties  v. Union of India  and D.K. Basu v. State
of W.B. SCC at p. 438.)
27. In cases involving violation of human rights, the courts must forever
remain alive to the international instruments and conventions and apply
the same to a given case when there is no inconsistency between the
international norms and the domestic law occupying the field. In the
instant case, the High Court appears to have totally ignored the intent
and content of the international conventions and norms while dealing
with the case.”
(ii)  Krishna Janardhan Bhat v. Dattaraya G. Hegde  54
54
267In the instant case, this Court relied upon international conventions to
determine  the  true  import  of  ‘burden  of  proof’,  under  the  Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881.  This Court held as under:
“44. The presumption of innocence is a human right . (See  Narendra
Singh v.  State of M.P.,  Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma  v.  State of
Maharashtra and  Rajesh  Ranjan  Yadav  v.  CBI.)  Article  6(2)  of  the
European Convention on Human  Rights  provides: “Everyone  charged
with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law.” Although India is not bound by the aforementioned
Convention and as such it may not be necessary like the countries
forming European countries to bring common law into land with the
Convention, a balancing of the accused’s rights and the interest of the
society is required to be taken into consideration . In India, however,
subject to the statutory interdicts, the said principle forms the basis of
criminal jurisprudence. For the aforementioned purpose the nature of
the  offence,  seriousness  as  also  gravity  thereof  may  be  taken  into
consideration.  The courts must be on guard to see that merely on the
application of presumption as contemplated under Section 139 of the
Negotiable  Instruments  Act,  the  same  may  not  lead  to  injustice  or
mistaken conviction . It is for the aforementioned reasons that we have
taken into consideration the decisions operating in the field where the
difficulty of proving a negative has been emphasised. It is not suggested
that a negative can never be proved but there are cases where such
difficulties are faced by the accused e.g. honest and reasonable mistake
of fact. In a recent article  The Presumption of Innocence and Reverse
Burdens: A Balancing Duty  published in 2007 CLJ (March Part) 142 it
has been stated:
“In  determining  whether  a  reverse  burden  is  compatible  with  the
presumption of innocence regard should also be had to the pragmatics of
proof. How difficult would it be for the prosecution to prove guilt without
the reverse burden? How easily could an innocent defendant discharge
the  reverse  burden?  But  courts  will  not  allow  these  pragmatic
considerations  to  override  the  legitimate  rights  of  the  defendant.
Pragmatism will have greater sway where the reverse burden would not
pose the risk of great injustice—where the offence is not too serious or
the  reverse  burden  only  concerns  a  matter  incidental  to  guilt.  And
greater weight will be given to prosecutorial efficiency in the regulatory
environment.”
45. We are not oblivious of the fact that the said provision has been
inserted  to  regulate  the  growing  business,  trade,  commerce  and
industrial activities of the country and the strict liability to promote
greater vigilance in financial matters and to safeguard the faith of the
creditor in the drawer of the cheque which is essential to the economic
life of a developing country like India. This, however, shall not mean that
the courts shall put a blind eye to the ground realities. Statute mandates
268raising  of  presumption  but  it  stops  at  that.  It  does  not  say  how
presumption drawn should be held to have rebutted. Other important
principles of legal jurisprudence, namely, presumption of innocence as
human rights and the doctrine of reverse burden introduced by Section
139 should be delicately balanced . Such balancing acts, indisputably
would largely depend upon the factual matrix of each case, the materials
brought on record and having regard to legal principles governing the
same.”
(iii) State of Kerala v. Peoples Union for Civil Liberties  55
The issue that arose for consideration in the instant case was with reference
to the binding nature of the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention,
1957 and the declarations on the Rights of Indigenous People, 2007.  Even
though India had ratified convention and declaration, it was held, that the
same  were  not  binding.   Reference  may  be  made  to  the  following
observations recorded in the above judgment:
“105. We  may  notice  that  in  Indigenous  and  Tribal  Populations
Convention, 1957 which has been ratified by 27 countries including
India contained the following clauses:
“Article  11.—The  right  of  ownership,  collective  or  individual,  of  the
members  of  the  populations  concerned  over  the  lands  which  these
populations traditionally occupy shall be recognised.
Article 12.—1. The populations concerned shall not be removed without
their free consent from their habitual territories except in accordance
with  national  laws  and  regulations  for  reasons  relating  to  national
security, or in the interest of national economic development or of the
health of the said populations.
2. When in such cases removal of these populations is necessary as an
exceptional measure, they shall be provided with lands of quality at least
equal  to  that  of  the  lands  previously  occupied  by them,  suitable  to
provide for their present needs and future development. In cases where
chances  of  alternative  employment  exist  and  where  the  populations
concerned prefer to have compensation in money or in kind, they shall
be so compensated under appropriate guarantees.
3. Persons thus removed shall be fully compensated for any resulting
loss or injury.
Article 13.—1. Procedures for the transmission of rights of ownership
and use of land which are established by the customs of the populations
concerned shall be respected, within the framework of national laws and
55
269regulations, insofar as they satisfy the needs of these populations and do
not hinder their economic and social development.
2. Arrangements shall be made to prevent persons who are not members
of the populations concerned from taking advantage of these customs or
of lack of understanding of the laws on the part of the members of these
populations to secure the ownership or use of the lands belonging to
such members.”
Thus, removal of the population, by way of an exceptional measure, is
not ruled out. It is only subject to the condition that lands of quality at
least equal to that of the lands previously occupied by them, suitable to
provide  for  their  present  needs  and  future  development.  We  may,
however, notice that this Convention has not been ratified by many
countries in the Convention held in 1989. Those who have ratified the
1989 Convention are not bound by it.
106. Furthermore,  the  United  Nations  adopted  a  Declaration  on  the
Rights of Indigenous People in September 2007. Articles 3 to 5 thereof
read as under:
“3. Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of
that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue
their economic, social and cultural development.
4. Indigenous peoples, in exercising their right to self-determination,
have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their
internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing their
autonomous functions.
5. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their
distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions, while
retaining their right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political,
economic, social and cultural life of the State.”
107. It is now accepted that the Panchasheel doctrine which provided
that the tribes could flourish and develop only if the State interfered
minimally and functioned chiefly as a support system in view of passage
of time is no longer valid. Even the notion of autonomy contained in the
1989 Convention has been rejected by India. However, India appears to
have softened its stand against autonomy for tribal people and it has
voted  in  favour  of  the  United  Nations  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of
Indigenous People which affirms various rights to autonomy that are
inherent in the tribal peoples of the world. This declaration, however, is
not binding.”
(iv) Safai Karamchari Andolan v. Union of India  56
In  the  instant  case,  the  question  that  arose  for  consideration  revolved
around the validity of the inhuman practice of manually removing night
soil, which involves removal of human excrements from dry toilets with bare
56
270hands, brooms or metal scrappers, and thereupon, carrying the same in
baskets to dumping sites for disposal.  Dealing with the issue in the context
of  international  conventions  and  declarations,  this  Court  observed  as
under:
“16. Apart from the provisions of the Constitution, there are various
international conventions and covenants to which India is a party, which
proscribe the inhuman practice of manual scavenging. These are the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the Convention on the
Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Racial  Discrimination  (CERD)  and  the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women (CEDAW). The relevant provisions of UDHR, CERD and CEDAW
are hereunder:
Article 1 of UDHR
“1. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They
are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one
another in a spirit of brotherhood.”
Article 2 of UDHR
“2. Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedom set forth in this
Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin,
property, birth or other status.”
Article 23(3) of UDHR
“23.  (3) Everyone  who  works  has  the  right  to  just  and  favourable
remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of
human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social
protection.”
Article 5(a) of CEDAW
“5. States parties shall take all appropriate measures—
(a) to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and
women,  with  a  view  to  achieving  the  elimination  of  prejudice  and
customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the
inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles
for men and women;”
Article 2 of CERD
“2. (1) States parties condemn racial discrimination and undertake to
pursue  by  all  appropriate  means  and  without  delay  a  policy  of
eliminating  racial  discrimination  in  all  its  forms  and  promoting
understanding among all races, and, to this end—
***
(c) each State party shall take effective measures to review governmental,
national and local policies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws and
regulations  which  have  the  effect  of  creating  or  perpetuating  racial
discrimination wherever it exists;
271(d) each State party shall prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate
means,  including  legislation  as  required  by  circumstances,  racial
discrimination by any persons, group or organisation;”
The above provisions of the International Covenants, which have been
ratified by India, are binding to the extent that they are not inconsistent
with the provisions of the domestic law .”
189.In view of the above, we are satisfied, that international conventions
and declarations are of utmost importance, and have to be taken into
consideration while interpreting domestic laws.  But, there is one important
exception to the above rule, and that is, that international conventions as
are not in conflict with domestic law, alone can be relied upon.  We are of
the  firm opinion, that the disputation in hand falls in the above exception.
Insofar  as  ‘personal  law’  is  concerned,  the  same  has  constitutional
protection.   Therefore  if  ‘personal  law’  is  in  conflict  with  international
conventions and declarations, ‘personal law’ will prevail.  The contention
advanced on behalf of the petitioners to hold the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’,
on account it being in conflict with conventions and declarations to which
India is a signatory can therefore not be acceded to.
X.   Conclusions emerging out of the above consideration :
190.The following conclusions emerge from the considerations recorded
at I to IX above:
(1)Despite the decision of the Rashid Ahmad case1 on the subject of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, by the Privy Council, the issue needs a fresh examination,
in view of the subsequent developments in the matter.
(2)All  the  parties  were  unanimous,  that  despite  the  practice  of
‘talaq-e-biddat’  being considered  sinful, it was accepted amongst Sunni
272Muslims belonging to the Hanafi school, as valid in law, and has been in
practice amongst them.
(3)It would not be appropriate for this Court, to record a finding,
whether the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ is, or is not, affirmed by ‘hadiths’, in
view of the enormous contradictions in the ‘hadiths’, relied upon by the rival
parties.
(4)‘Talaq-e-biddat’  is integral to the religious denomination of Sunnis
belonging to the Hanafi school.  The same is a part of their faith, having
been followed for more than 1400 years, and as such, has to be accepted as
being constituent of their ‘personal law’.
(5)The  contention  of  the  petitioners,  that  the  questions/subjects
covered by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, ceased
to be ‘personal law’, and got transformed into ‘statutory law’, cannot be
accepted, and is accordingly rejected.
(6)‘Talaq-e-biddat’, does not violate the parameters expressed in Article
25  of  the  Constitution.   The  practice  is  not  contrary  to  public  order,
morality and health.  The practice also does not violate Articles 14, 15 and
21 of the Constitution, which are limited to State actions alone.
(7)The practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ being a constituent of ‘personal law’
has a stature equal to other fundamental rights, conferred in Part III of the
Constitution.  The practice cannot therefore be set aside, on the ground of
being violative of the concept of the constitutional morality, through judicial
intervention.
273(8)Reforms  to  ‘personal  law’  in  India,  with  reference  to   socially
unacceptable practices in different religions, have come about only by way
of legislative intervention. Such legislative intervention is permissible under
Articles 25(2) and 44, read with entry 5 of the Concurrent List, contained in
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.  The said procedure alone need to
be followed with reference to the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, if the same is to
be set aside.
(9)International conventions and declarations are of no avail in the
present controversy, because the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, is a component
of ‘personal law’, and has the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution.
Part-10.
The declaration:
191.The whole nation seems to be up in arms.  There is seemingly an
overwhelming majority of Muslim-women, demanding that the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ which is sinful in theology, be declared as impermissible in
law.  The Union of India, has also participated in the debate.  It has adopted
an  aggressive  posture,  seeking  the  invalidation  of  the  practice  by
canvassing, that it violates the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of
the  Constitution,  and  by  further  asserting,  that  it  even  violates
constitutional morality.  During the course of hearing, the issue was hotly
canvassed in the media.  Most of the views expressed in erudite articles on
the subject, hugely affirmed that the practice was demeaning.  Interestingly
even during the course of hearing, learned counsel appearing for the rival
parties, were in agreement, and described the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’
differently as, unpleasant, distasteful and unsavory.  The position adopted
274by others was harsher, they considered it as disgusting, loathsome and
obnoxious.   Some  even  described  it  as  being  debased,  abhorrent  and
wretched.
192.We have arrived at the conclusion, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’, is a matter
of ‘personal law’ of Sunni Muslims, belonging to the Hanafi school.  It
constitutes a matter of their faith. It has been practiced by them, for at least
1400  years.   We  have  examined  whether  the  practice  satisfies  the
constraints provided for under Article 25 of the Constitution, and have
arrived at the conclusion, that it does not breach any of them.  We have also
come to the conclusion, that the practice being a component of ‘personal
law’, has the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution.
193.  Religion is a matter of faith, and not of logic.  It is not open to a
court to accept an egalitarian approach, over a practice which constitutes
an integral part of religion.  The Constitution allows the followers of every
religion, to follow their beliefs and religious traditions.  The Constitution
assures believers of all faiths, that their way of life, is guaranteed, and
would not be subjected to any challenge, even though they may seem to
others (-and even rationalists, practicing the same faith) unacceptable, in
today’s world and age.  The Constitution extends this guarantee, because
faith constitutes the religious consciousness, of the followers.  It is this
religious consciousness, which binds believers into separate entities.  The
Constitution endevours to protect and preserve, the beliefs of each of the
separate entities, under Article 25.
275194.Despite the views expressed by those who challenged the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’, being able to demonstrate that the practice transcends the
barriers of constitutional morality (emerging from different provisions of the
Constitution), we have found ourselves unable to persuade ourselves, from
reaching out in support of the petitioners concerns.  We cannot accept the
petitioners’ claim, because the challenge raised is in respect of an issue of
‘personal law’ which has constitutional protection.
195.In  continuation  of  the  position  expressed  above,  we  may
acknowledge, that most of the prayers made to the Court (-at least on first
blush) were persuasive enough, to solicit acceptance.  Keeping in mind, that
this opportunity had presented itself, so to say, to assuage the cause of
Muslim women, it was felt, that the opportunity should not be lost.  We are
however satisfied that, that would not be the rightful course to tread.  We
were obliged to keep reminding ourselves, of the wisdoms of the framers of
the Constitution, who placed matters of faith in Part III of the Constitution.
Therefore, any endeavour to proceed on issues canvassed before us would,
tantamount to overlooking the clear letter of law.   We cannot nullify and
declare as unacceptable in law, what the Constitution decrees us, not only
to protect, but also to enforce.  The authority to safeguard and compel
compliance, is vested under a special jurisdiction in constitutional Courts
(-under Article 32, with the Supreme Court; and under Article 226, with the
High  Courts).  Accepting  the  petitioners  prayers,  would  be  in  clear
transgression of the constitutional mandate contained in Article 25.
276196.Such a call of conscience, as the petitioners desire us to accept,
may well have a cascading effect.  We say so, because the contention of the
learned Attorney General was, that ‘talaq-e-ahsan’ and ‘talaq-e-hasan’ were
also liable to be declared unconstitutional, for the same reasons as have
been  expressed  with  reference  to  ‘talaq-e-biddat’  (-for  details,  refer  to
paragraph 77 above).  According to the learned Attorney General, the said
forms of talaq also suffered from the same infirmities as ‘talaq-e-biddat’.
The practices of ‘polygamy’ and ‘halala’ amongst Muslims are already under
challenge  before  us.  It  is  not  difficult  to  comprehend,  what  kind  of
challenges would be raised by rationalists, assailing practices of different
faiths on diverse grounds, based on all kinds of enlightened sensibilities.
We have to be guarded, lest we find our conscience traversing into every
nook and corner of religious practices, and ‘personal law’.  Can a court,
based on a righteous endeavour, declare that a matter of faith, be replaced –
or be completely done away with. In the instant case, both prayers have
been  made.  Replacement  has  been  sought  by  reading  the  three
pronouncements in ‘talaq-e-biddat’, as one. Alternatively, replacement has
been sought by reading into ‘talaq-e-biddat’, measures of arbitration and
conciliation, described in the Quran and the ‘hadiths’.  The prayer is also
for setting aside the practice, by holding it to be unconstitutional. The
wisdom emerging from judgments rendered by this Court is unambiguous,
namely,  that  while  examining  issues  falling  in  the  realm  of  religious
practices  or  ‘personal  law’,  it  is  not  for  a  court  to  make  a  choice  of
something which it considers as forward looking or non-fundamentalist.  It
277is not for a court to determine whether religious practices were prudent or
progressive or regressive.  Religion and ‘personal law’, must be perceived, as
it is accepted, by the followers of the faith.  And not, how another would like
it to be (-including self-proclaimed rationalists, of the same faith).  Article
25 obliges all Constitutional Courts to protect ‘personal laws’ and not to
find fault therewith.  Interference in matters of ‘personal law’ is clearly
beyond judicial examination.  The judiciary must therefore, always exercise
absolute restraint, no matter how compelling and attractive the opportunity
to do societal good may seem.  It is therefore, that this Court had the
occasion to observe, “….. However laudible, desirable and attractive the
result may seem … an  activist Court is not fully equipped to cope with the
intricacies  of  the  legislative  subject  and  can  at  best  advise  and  focus
attention on the State polity on the problem and shake it from its slumber,
goading it to awaken, march and reach the goal.  For, in whatever measure
be  the  concern  of  this  Court,  it  compulsively  needs  to  apply,  motion,
described in judicial parlance as self-restraint …..”30
197.We have arrived at the conclusion, that the legal challenge raised at
the behest of the petitioners must fail, on the judicial front.  Be that as it
may, the question still remains, whether this is a fit case for us to exercise
our jurisdiction under Article 142, “…for doing complete justice …”, in the
matter.   The  reason  for  us  to  probe  the  possibility  of  exercising  our
jurisdiction under Article 142, arises only for one simple reason, that all
concerned are unequivocal, that besides being arbitrary the practice of
‘talaq-e-biddat’ is gender discriminatory.   
278198.A perusal of the consideration recorded by us reveals, that the
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ has been done away with, by way of legislation in
a large number of egalitarian States, with sizeable Muslim population and
even by theocratic Islamic States.  Even the AIMPLB, the main contestant of
the petitioners’ prayers, whilst accepting the position canvassed on behalf of
the petitioners, assumed the position, that it was not within the realm of
judicial discretion, to set aside a matter of faith and religion.  We have
accepted  the  position  assumed  by  the  AIMPLB.  It  was  however
acknowledged even by the AIMPLB, that legislative will, could salvage the
situation.  This assertion was based on a conjoint reading of Articles 25(2)
and Article 44 of the Constitution, read with entry 5 of the Concurrent List
contained in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.  There can be no
doubt, and it is our definitive conclusion, that the position can only be
salvaged by way of legislation.  We understand, that it is not appropriate to
tender advice to the legislature, to enact law on an issue.  However, the
position as it presents in the present case, seems to be a little different.
Herein, the views expressed by the rival parties are not in contradiction.
The Union of India has appeared before us in support of the cause of the
petitioners.  The stance adopted by the Union of India is sufficient for us to
assume,  that  the  Union  of  India  supports  the  petitioners’  cause.
Unfortunately, the Union seeks at our hands, what truly falls in its own.
The main party that opposed the petitoners’ challenge, namely, the AIMPLB
filed an affidavit before this Court affirming the following position:
“1.  I am the Secretary of All India Muslim Personal Board will issue an
advisory through its Website, Publications and Social Media Platforms
279and  thereby  advise  the  persons  who  perform  ‘Nikah’  (marriage)  and
request them to do the following:-
(a)  At the time of performing ‘Nikah’ (marriage), the person performing
the ‘Nikah’ will advise the Bridegroom/Man that in case of differences
leading to Talaq the Bridegroom/Man shall not pronounce three divorces
in one sitting since it is an undesirable practice in Shariat ;
(b)  That  at  the  time  of  performing  ‘Nikah’  (Marriage),  the  person
performing the ‘Nikah’ will advise both the Bridegroom/Man and the
Bride/Woman to incorporate a condition in the ‘Nikahnama’ to exclude
resorting to pronouncement of three divorces by her husband in one
sitting.
3.   I say and submit that, in addition, the Board is placing on record,
that the Working Committee of the Board had earlier already passed
certain resolutions in the meeting held on 15  th   & 16  th   April, 2017 in
relation to Divorce (Talaq) in the Muslim community.  Thereby it was
resolved to convey a code of conduct/guidelines to be followed in the
matters of divorce particularly emphasizing to avoid pronouncement of
three divorces in one sitting .  A copy of the resolution dated April 16,
2017 along with the relevant Translation of Resolution Nos. 2, 3, 4 & 5
relating to Talaq (Divorce) is enclosed herewith for the perusal of this
Hon’ble Court and marked as Annexure A-1 (Colly) [Page Nos. 4 to 12] to
the present Affidavit.”
A perusal of the above affidavit reveals, that the AIMPLB has undertaken to
issue an advisory through its website, to advise those who enter into a
matrimonial  alliance,  to  agree  in  the  ‘nikah-nama’,  that  their  marriage
would not be dissolvable by ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  The AIMPLB has sworn an
affidavit  to  prescribe  guidelines,  to  be  followed  in  matters  of  divorce,
emphasizing that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ be avoided.   It would not be incorrect to
assume, that even the AIMPLB is on board, to assuage the petitioner’s
cause.
199.In view of the position expressed above, we are satisfied, that  this is
a case which presents a situation where this Court should exercise its
discretion  to  issue  appropriate  directions  under  Article  142  of  the
Constitution.  We therefore hereby direct, the Union of India to consider
appropriate legislation, particularly with reference to ‘talaq-e-biddat’.  We
280hope  and  expect,  that  the  contemplated  legislation  will  also  take  into
consideration advances in Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, as have been
corrected by legislation the world over, even by theocratic Islamic States.
When the British rulers in India provided succor to Muslims by legislation,
and when remedial measures have been adopted by the Muslim world, we
find no reason, for an independent India, to lag behind.  Measures have
been adopted for other religious denominations (see at IX – Reforms to
‘personal law’ in India), even in India, but not for the Muslims.  We would
therefore implore the legislature, to bestow its thoughtful consideration, to
this  issue  of  paramount importance.   We  would  also  beseech  different
political  parties  to  keep  their  individual  political  gains  apart,  while
considering the necessary measures requiring legislation.
200.Till such time as legislation in the matter is considered, we are
satisfied in injuncting Muslim husbands, from pronouncing ‘talaq-e-biddat’
as  a  means  for  severing  their  matrimonial  relationship.   The  instant
injunction,  shall  in  the  first  instance,  be  operative  for  a  period  of  six
months.  If the legislative process commences before the expiry of the period
of  six  months,  and  a  positive  decision  emerges  towards  redefining
‘talaq-e-biddat’ (three pronouncements of ‘talaq’, at one and the same time)
– as one, or alternatively, if it is decided that the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’
be done away with altogether, the injunction would continue, till legislation
is finally enacted.  Failing which, the injunction shall cease to operate.
201.Disposed of in the above terms.

J U D G M E N T 
KURIAN, J.:
1.What is bad in theology was once good in law
but  after  Shariat  has  been  declared  as  the
personal  law,  whether  what  is  Quranically
wrong can be legally right is the issue to be
considered in this case. Therefore, the simple
question that needs to be answered in this case
283REPORTABLEis  only  whether  triple  talaq  has  any  legal
sanctity. That is no more res integra. This Court
in Shamim Ara  v. State of UP and Another  57
has held, though not in so many words, that
triple  talaq  lacks  legal  sanctity.  Therefore,  in
terms of Article 14158, Shamim Ara  is the law
that is applicable in India.
2.Having  said  that,  I  shall  also  make  an
independent  endeavor  to  explain  the  legal
position in Shamim Ara  and lay down the law
explicitly. 
3.The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application
Act, 1937 (hereinafter referred to as “the 1937
Act”) was enacted to put an end to the unholy,
oppressive  and  discriminatory  customs  and
usages in the Muslim community.59 Section 2 is
most  relevant  in  the  face  of  the  present
controversy. 
2.  Application  of  Personal  law  to
Muslims. –  Notwithstanding any custom or
usage to the contrary, in all questions (save
questions  relating  to  agricultural  land)
57
58
59
284regarding  intestate  succession,  special
property  of  females,  including  personal
property inherited or obtained under contract
or gift or any other provision of Personal Law,
marriage,  dissolution  of marriage,  including
talaq,  ila,  zihar,  lian,  khula  and  mubaraat ,
maintenance,  dower,  guardianship,  gifts,
trusts and trust properties, and wakfs (other
than charities and charitable institutions and
charitable and religious endowments) the rule
of  decision  in  cases  where  the  parties  are
Muslims  shall  be  Muslim  Personal  Law
(  Shariat  ). 
(Emphasis supplied)
4.After  the  1937  Act,  in  respect  of  the
enumerated subjects under Section 2 regarding
“marriage,  dissolution  of  marriage,  including
talaq”,  the  law  that  is applicable  to  Muslims
shall be only their personal law namely Shariat.
Nothing  more,  nothing  less.  It  is  not  a
legislation regulating talaq. In contradistinction,
The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939
provides  for  the  grounds  for  dissolution  of
marriage.  So  is  the  case  with  the  Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. The 1937 Act simply makes
Shariat applicable as the rule of decision in the
matters  enumerated  in  section  2.  Therefore,
while talaq is governed by Shariat, the specific
285grounds and procedure for talaq have not been
codified in the 1937 Act. 
5.In that view of the matter, I wholly agree with
the learned Chief Justice that the 1937 Act is
not a legislation regulating talaq. Consequently,
I respectfully disagree with the stand taken by
Nariman, J. that the 1937 Act is a legislation
regulating triple talaq and hence, the same can
be tested on the anvil of Article 14. However,
on the pure question of law that a legislation,
be it plenary or subordinate, can be challenged
on the ground of arbitrariness, I agree with the
illuminating exposition of law by Nariman, J. I
am  also  of  the  strong  view  that  the
Constitutional  democracy  of  India  cannot
conceive of a legislation which is arbitrary. 
6.Shariat,  having  been  declared  to  be  Muslim
Personal  Law  by  the  1937  Act,  we  have  to
necessarily see what Shariat is. This has been
beautifully explained by the renowned author,
Asaf  A.A.  Fyzee  in  his  book Outlines  of
286Muhammadan  Law,  5th Edition,  2008  at
page 10.60
“…What  is  morally  beautiful  that  must  be
done; and what is morally ugly must not be
done. That is law or Shariat and nothing else
can  be  law.  But  what  is  absolutely  and
indubitably beautiful, and what is absolutely
and  indubitably  ugly?  These  are  the
important  legal  questions;  and  who  can
answer  them?  Certainly  not  man,  say  the
Muslim legists.  We have the Qur’an which is
the very word of God. Supplementary to it we
have    Hadith   which are the Traditions of the
Prophet- the records of his actions and his
sayings- from which we must derive help and
inspiration  in  arriving  at  legal  decisions.  If
there is nothing either in the Qur’an or in the
Hadith   to  answer  the  particular  question
which  is  before  us,  we  have  to  follow  the
dictates of secular reason in accordance with
certain  definite  principles.  These  principles
constitute the basis of sacred law or   Shariat
as the Muslim doctors understand it.  And it is
these fundamental juristic notions which we
must  try  to  study  and  analyse  before  we
approach the study of the Islamic civil law as
a whole, or even that small part of it which in
India is known as Muslim law.”
7.There are four sources for Islamic law- (i) Quran
(ii)  Hadith  (iii)  Ijma  (iv)  Qiyas.  The  learned
author has rightly said that the Holy Quran is
the  “first  source  of  law”.  According  to  the
learned author, pre-eminence is to be given to
60
287the Quran. That means, sources other than the
Holy  Quran  are  only  to  supplement  what  is
given in it and to supply what is not provided
for. In other words, there cannot be any Hadith,
Ijma or Qiyas against what is expressly stated
in  the  Quran.   Islam  cannot  be  anti-Quran.
According  to  Justice  Bader  Durrez  Ahmad  in
Masroor Ahmed  v.  State (NCT of Delhi) &
Another  61:
   “14. In essence, the Shariat is a compendium of
rules guiding the life of a Muslim from birth to
death in all aspects of law, ethics and etiquette.
These  rules  have  been  crystallized  through  the
process  of  ijtihad employing  the  sophisticated
jurisprudential techniques.  The primary source is
the   Quran  . Yet, in matters not directly covered by
the divine book, rules were developed looking to
the    hadis    and  upon  driving  a  consensus .  The
differences arose between the schools because of
reliance  on  different  hadis,  differences  in
consensus and differences on qiyas and aql as the
case may be.”
(Emphasis supplied)
8.It is in that background that I make an attempt
to see what the Quran states on talaq. There is
reference  to  talaq  in  three  Suras-  in  Sura  II
while dealing with social life of the community,
61
288in Sura IV while dealing with decencies of family
life and in Sura LXV while dealing explicitly with
talaq.
9.Sura LXV of the Quran deals with talaq. It reads
as follows:
“Talaq, or Divorce.
In the name of God, Most Gracious,
                                         Most Merciful.             
1. O Prophet! When ye
Do divorce women,
Divorce them at their
Prescribed periods,
And count (accurately)
Their prescribed periods:
And fear God your Lord:
And turn them not out
Of their houses, nor shall
They (themselves) leave,
Except in case they are 
Guilty of some open lewdness,
Those are limits
Set by God: and any
Who transgresses the limits
Of God, does verily 
Wrong his (own) soul:
Thou knowest not if
Perchance God will
Bring about thereafter
Some new situation.
2. Thus when they fulfill
Their term appointed, 
Either take them back
On equitable terms
Or part with them
On equitable terms;
And take for witness
289T wo persons from among you,
Endued with justice,
And establish the evidence
(As) before God.  Such
Is the admonition given
T o him who believes
In God and the Last Day.
And for those who fear
God, He (ever) prepares 
A way out,
3. And He provides for him
From (sources) he never
Could imagine. And if
Any one puts his trust
In God, sufficient is (God)
For him. For God will 
Surely accomplish His purpose :
Verily, for all things
Has God appointed
A due proportion. 
4. Such of your women
As have passed the age
Of monthly courses, for them
The prescribed period, if ye
Have any doubts, is
Three months, and for those
Who have no courses
(It is the same):
For those who carry
(Life within their wombs),
Their period is until
They deliver their burdens :
And for those who 
Fear God, He will
Make their path easy. 
5. That is the Command
Of God, which He
Has sent down to you :
And if any one fears God,
He will remove his ills
From him, and will enlarge
His reward. 
2906. Let the women live 
(In ‘iddat) in the same
Style as ye live,
According to your means :
Annoy them not, so as
T o restrict them. 
And if they carry (life
In their wombs), then
Spend (your substance) on them 
Until they deliver
Their burden : and if
They suckle your (offspring),
Give them their recompense :
And take mutual counsel
T ogether, according to
What is just and reasonable.
And if ye find yourselves
In difficulties, let another
Woman suckle (the child)
On the (father’s) behalf.
7. Let the man of means
Spend according to 
His means : and the man
Whose resources are restricted,
Let him spend according
T o what God has given him.
God puts no burden
On any person beyond
What He has given him. 
After a difficulty, God
Will soon grant relief.”
Verse 35 in Sura IV of the Quran speaks on arbitration for
reconciliation-
“35. If ye fear a breach
Between them twain,
Appoint (two) arbiters,
One from his family,
And the other from hers;
If they wish for peace,
291God will cause 
Their reconciliation:
For God hath full knowledge,
And is acquainted
With all things.”
Sura II contains the following verses pertaining to divorce:
“226.For those who take
An oath for abstention
From their wives,
A waiting for four months
Is ordained;
If then they return,
God is Oft–forgiving,
Most Merciful.
227.But if their intention
Is firm for divorce,
God heareth
And knoweth all things.
228. Divorced women
Shall wait concerning themselves
For three monthly periods.
Nor is it lawful for them
T o hide what God
Hath created in their wombs,
If they have faith
In God and the Last Day.
And their husbands
Have the better right
T o take them back
In that period, if
They wish for reconciliation.
And women shall have rights
Similar to the rights
Against them, according
T o what is equitable;
But men have a degree
(of advantage) over them.
And God is Exalted in Power,
                                        Wise.”
“229. A divorce is only
292Permissible twice: after that,
The parties should either hold
T ogether on equitable terms,
Or separate with kindness.
It is not lawful for you,
(Men), to take back
Any of your gifts (from your wives), 
Except when both parties
Fear that they would be
Unable to keep the limits
Ordained by God.
If ye (judges) do indeed
Fear that they would be
Unable to keep the limits
Ordained by God,
There is no blame on either
Of them if she give
Something for her freedom.
These are the limits
Ordained by God;
So do not transgress them
If any do transgress
The limits ordained by God,
Such persons wrong
(Themselves as well as others).
230. So if a husband
Divorces his wife (irrevocably),
He cannot, after that,
Re-marry her until 
After she has married
Another husband and 
He has divorced her.
In that case there is 
No blame on either of them
If they re-unite, provided
They feel that they
Can keep the limits
Ordained by God.
Such other limits
Ordained by God,
Which He makes plain
T o those who understand.
231. When ye divorce
293Women, and they fulfill
The term of their (‘ Iddat),
Either take them back
On equitable terms
Or set them free
On equitable terms;
But do not take them back
T o injure them, (or) to take
Undue advantage;
If anyone does that,
He wrongs his own soul.
Do not treat God’s Signs
As a jest,
But solemnly rehearse
God’s favours on you,
And the fact that He
Sent down to you
The Book
And Wisdom,
For your instruction.
And fear God,
And know that God
Is well acquainted
With all things.”62
10.These instructive verses do not require any
interpretative  exercise.  They  are  clear  and
unambiguous as far as talaq is concerned. The
Holy  Quran  has  attributed  sanctity  and
permanence  to  matrimony.  However,  in
extremely  unavoidable  situations,  talaq  is
permissible. But an  attempt for reconciliation
and  if  it  succeeds,  then  revocation  are  the
Quranic  essential  step s  before  talaq  attains
62
294finality.63 In  triple  talaq,  this  door  is  closed,
hence, triple talaq is against the basic tenets of
the Holy Quran  and consequently,  it violates
Shariat. 
11.The  above  view  has  been  endorsed  by
various  High  Courts,  finally  culminating  in
Shamim  Ara  by  this  Court  which  has  since
been taken as the law for banning triple talaq.
Interestingly,  prior  to  Shamim  Ara ,  Krishna
Iyer,  J.  in  Fuzlunbi v.  K  Khader  Vali  and
Another  64, while in a three judge bench in this
Court, made a very poignant observation on the
erroneous approach of Batchelor, J. in Sarabai
v. Rabiabai  65 on the famous comment “good in
law, though bad in theology”. T o quote:
“20. Before we bid farewell to  Fuzlunbi it is
necessary  to  mention  that  Chief  Justice
Baharul  Islam,  in  an  elaborate  judgment
replete  with  quotes  from  the  Holy  Quoran,
has exposed the error of early English authors
and judges who dealt with  talaq in Muslim
Law as good even if pronounced at whim or in
tantrum, and argued against the diehard view
63
64
65
295of Batchelor, J. that this view “is good in law,
though bad in theology”. Maybe, when the
point directly arises, the question will have to
be considered by this Court but enough unto
the  day  the  evil  thereof  and  we  do  not
express  our  opinion  on  this  question  as  it
does not call for a decision in the present
case.”
12.More than two decades later, Shamim Ara
has referred to, as already noted above,  the
legal  perspective  across  the  country  on  the
issue of triple talaq starting with the decision of
the Calcutta High Court in Furzund Hossein  v.
Janu  Bibee  66 in  1878  and  finally,  after
discussing two decisions of the Gauhati High
Court  namely   Jiauddin  Ahmed  v.  Anwara
Begum  67  and   Rukia  Khatun  v.  Abdul
Khalique Laskar  68, this Court held as follows- 
“13.  There  is  yet  another  illuminating  and
weighty  judicial  opinion  available  in  two
decisions of the Gauhati High Court recorded
by  Baharul  Islam,  J.  (later  a  Judge  of  the
Supreme  Court  of  India)  sitting  singly  in
Jiauddin Ahmed v.  Anwara Begum  (1981) 1
Gau  LR  358  and  later  speaking  for  the
Division  Bench  in  Rukia  Khatun  v.Abdul
Khalique  Laskar  (1981)  1  Gau  LR  375.  In
Jiauddin  Ahmed  case  a  plea  of  previous
66
67
68
296divorce i.e. the husband having divorced the
wife on some day much previous to the date
of filing of the written statement in the Court
was taken and upheld. The question posed
before the High Court was whether there has
been valid  talaq of the wife by the husband
under  the  Muslim  law.  The  learned  Judge
observed  that  though  marriage  under  the
Muslim law is only a civil contract yet the
rights and responsibilities consequent upon it
are  of  such  importance  to  the  welfare  of
humanity, that a high degree of sanctity is
attached to it. But inspite of the sacredness
of the character of the marriage tie, Islam
recognizes  the  necessity,  in  exceptional
circumstances, of keeping the way open for
its  dissolution  (para  6).  Quoting  in  the
judgment  several  Holy  Quranic  verses  and
from  commentaries  thereon  by
well-recognized scholars of great eminence,
the learned Judge expressed disapproval of
the  statement  that  ""the  whimsical  and
capricious divorce by the husband is good in
law, though bad in theology"" and observed
that  such  a  statement  is  based  on  the
concept that women were chattel belonging
to men, which the Holy Quran does not brook.
The correct law of    talaq   as ordained by the
Holy  Quran  is  that    talaq   must  be  for  a
reasonable  cause  and  be  preceded  by
attempts  at  reconciliation  between  the
husband and the wife by two arbiters - one
from the wife's family and the other from the
husband's; if the attempts fail, ‘  talaq’   may be
effected. (para 13). In   Rukia Khatun case  , the
Division Bench stated that the correct law of
talaq   as ordained by the Holy Quran, is: (i)
that 'talaq' must be for a reasonable cause;
and  (ii)  that  it  must  be  preceded  by  an
297attempt  of  reconciliation  between  the
husband and the wife by two arbiters, one
chosen by the wife from her family and the
other  by  the  husband  from  his.  If  their
attempts  fail,  'talaq'  may  be  effected.  The
Division Bench expressly recorded its dissent
from the Calcutta and Bombay views which,
in their opinion, did not lay down the correct
law.
14. We are in respectful agreement with the
above said observations made by the learned
Judges of High Courts…. ”
                                                           (Emphasis supplied)
13.There  is  also  a  fruitful  reference  to  two
judgments of the Kerala High Court - one of
Justice Krishna Iyer in  A. Yousuf Rawther  v.
Sowramma  69 and the other of Justice V. Khalid
in Mohd. Haneefa  v. Pathummal Beevi  70. No
doubt,  Sowaramma  was not a case on triple
talaq, however, the issue has been discussed in
the judgment in  paragraph 7 which has also
been quoted in Shamim Ara .
“..The view that the Muslim husband enjoys
an arbitrary, unilateral power to inflict instant
divorce  does  not  accord  with  Islamic
injunctions.  …It  is  a  popular  fallacy  that  a
Muslim male enjoys, under the Quoranic law,
unbridled authority to liquidate the marriage.
‘The whole Quoran expressly forbids a man to
69
70
298seek pretexts for divorcing his wife, so long
as she remains faithful and obedient to him,
""if they (namely, women) obey you, then do
not  seek  a  way  against  them”.’  (Quoran
IV:34).  The  Islamic  law  gives  to  the  man
primarily  the  faculty  of  dissolving  the
marriage, if the wife, by her indocility or her
bad  character,  renders  the  married  life
unhappy;  but  in  the  absence  of  serious
reasons, no man can justify a divorce, either
in  the  eye  of  religion  or  the  law.  If  he
abandons his wife or puts her away in simple
caprice,  he  draws  upon  himself  the  divine
anger, for the curse of God, said the Prophet,
rests  on  him  who  repudiates  his  wife
capriciously.""  ….Commentators  on  the
Quoran  have  rightly  observed  -  and  this
tallies with the law now administered in some
Muslim countries like Iraq -that the husband
must satisfy the court about the reasons for
divorce. However, Muslim law, as applied in
India,  has  taken  a  course  contrary  to  the
spirit of what the Prophet or the Holy Quoran
laid  down  and  the  same  misconception
vitiates the law dealing with the wife's right
to divorce…""  
14.Khalid,  J.  has  been  more  vocal  in  Mohd.
Haneefa:
“5..Should Muslim wives suffer this tyranny
for  all  times?  Should  their  personal  law
remain  so  cruel  towards  these  unfortunate
wives?  Can  it  not  be  amended  suitably  to
alleviate  their  sufferings?  My  judicial
conscience is disturbed at this monstrosity.
The question is whether the conscience of the
299leaders of public opinion of the community
will also be disturbed.”
 15.After  a  detailed  discussion  on  the
aforementioned cases, it has been specifically
held  by  this  Court  in  Shamim  Ara ,  at
paragraph  15  that  “… there  are  no  reasons
substantiated  in  justification  of    talaq   and  no
plea or proof that any effort at reconciliation
preceded the    talaq.” It has to be particularly
noted  that  this  conclusion  by  the  Bench  in
Shamim  Ara  is  made  after  “ respectful
agreement” with  Jiauddin Ahmed  that “talaq
must  be  for  a  reasonable  cause  and  be
preceded by attempts at reconciliation between
the husband and the wife by two arbiters — one
from the wife’s family and the other from the
husband’s; if the attempts fail, ‘ talaq’ may be
effected.” In the light of such  specific findings
as to how triple talaq is bad in law on account
of not following the Quranic principles, it cannot
be said that there is no ratio decidendi  on triple
talaq in Shamim Ara .
30016.      Shamim Ara  has since been understood by
various High Courts across the country as the
law deprecating triple talaq as it is opposed to
the  tenets  of  the  Holy  Quran.  Consequently,
triple talaq lacks the approval of Shariat. 
17.The  High  Court  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  in
Zamrud  Begum  v.  K.  Md.  Haneef  and
another  71, is one of the first High Courts to
affirm the view adopted in  Shamim Ara . The
High Court, after referring to Shamim Ara  and
all the other decisions mentioned therein, held
in paragraphs 13 and 17 as follows: 
“13.  It is observed by the Supreme Court in
the above said decision that talaq may be
oral  or  in  writing  and  it  must  be  for  a
reasonable cause. It must be preceded by an
attempt of reconciliation of husband and wife
by two arbitrators one chosen from the family
of  the  wife and other  by husband.  If  their
attempts fail then talaq may be effected by
pronouncement.  The said procedure has not
been followed. The Supreme Court has culled
out the same from Mulla and the principles of
Mahammedan Law.
XXXX
17.  I  am  of  the  considered  view  that  the
alleged talaq is not a valid talaq as it is not in
accordance with the principles laid down by
71
301the Supreme Court.  If there is no valid talaq
the relationship of the wife with her husband
still continues and she cannot be treated as a
divorced wife….”
(Emphasis supplied)
18.In A. S. Parveen Akthar  v. The Union of
India  72, the High Court of Madras was posed
with  the  question  on  the  validity  and
constitutionality of Section 2 of the 1937 Act in
so far as it recognises triple talaq as a valid
form  of  divorce.  The  Court  referred  to  the
provisions  of  the  Quran,  opinions  of  various
eminent scholars of Islamic Law and previous
judicial  pronouncements  including  Shamim
Ara and came to the following conclusion: 
“45.Thus,  the  law  with  regard  to  talaq,  as
declared by the apex Court, is that talaq must
be  for  a  reasonable  cause  and  must  be
preceded  by  attempt  at  reconciliation
between the husband and the wife by two
arbiters one chosen by wife's family and the
other from husband's family and it is only if
their attempts fail, talaq may be effected.
                                                         XXXX
48.Having regard to the law now declared by
the apex Court in the case of  Shamim Ara,
2002 AIR SCW 4162, talaq, in whatever form,
72
302must be for a reasonable cause, and must be
preceded  by  attempts  for  reconciliation  by
arbiters chosen from the families of each of
the  spouses,  the  petitioner's  apprehension
that notwithstanding absence of cause and
no efforts having been made to reconcile the
spouses, this form of talaq is valid, is based
on a misunderstanding of the law.”
(Emphasis supplied)
As far as the constitutionality of Section 2 is concerned,
the Court refrained from going into the question in view of
the  decisions  of  this  Court  in  Shri  Krishna  Singh  v.
Mathura Ahir and Others  73 and Ahmedabad Women
Action Group (AWAG) and Ors . v. Union of India  74. 
19.The High Court of Jammu and Kashmir, in
Manzoor Ahmad Khan  v.Saja & Ors.  75, has
also  placed  reliance  on  Shamim  Ara .  The
Court, at paragraph 11, noted that in Shamim
Ara, the Apex Court relied upon the passages
from judgments of various High Courts “which
are  eye  openers  for  those  who  think  that  a
Muslim  man  can  divorce  his  wife  merely  at
whim or on caprice.” The Court finally held that
73
74
75
303the marriage between the parties did not stand
dissolved.
20.In  Ummer  Farooque  v.  Naseema  76,
Justices R Bhaskaran and K.P . Balachandran of
the  High  Court  of  Kerala,  after  due
consideration  of  the  prior  decisions  of  the
various Courts, in paragraphs 5 and 6 held that:
“5…The  general  impression  as  reflected  in
the decision of a Division Bench of this Court
in Pathayi v. Moideen (1968 KLT 763) was that
the  only  condition  necessary  for  a  valid
exercise of the right of divorce by a husband
is that he must be a major and of sound mind
at the that time and he can effect divorce
whenever he desires and no witnesses are
necessary for dissolution of the marriage and
the  moment  when  talaq  is  pronounced,
dissolution of marriage is effected; it can be
conveyed by the husband to the wife and it
need not be even addressed to her and it
takes  effect  the  moment  it  comes  to  her
knowledge  etc.  But  this  can  no  longer  be
accepted  in  view  of  the  authoritative
pronouncement  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
Shamim Ara v. State of U.P . [2002 (3) KLT 537
(SC)]. 
6. The only thing to be further considered in
this case is whether the divorce alleged to
have  been  effected  by  the  husband  by
pronouncement  of  talaq  on  23-7-1999  is
proved or not.  The mere pronouncement of
76
304talaq three times even in the presence of the
wife is not sufficient to effect a divorce under
Mohammadan Law. As held by the Supreme
Court in   Shamim Ara's   case [2002 (3) KLT 537
(SC)],  there  should  be  an  attempt  of
mediation by two mediators; one on the side
of the husband and the other on the side of
the wife and only in case it was a failure that
the husband is entitled to pronounce talaq to
divorce the wife… ”
(Emphasis supplied)
21.In  Masroor Ahmed , Justice Badar Durrez
Ahmed, held as follows:
“32.  In  these  circumstances  (the
circumstances  being  –  (1)  no  evidence  of
pronouncement of  talaq; (2) no reasons and
justification of talaq; amd (3) no plea or proof
that  talaq was preceded by efforts towards
reconciliation), the Supreme Court held that
the marriage was not dissolved and that the
liability of the husband to pay maintenance
continued. Thus, after    Shamim Ara   (supra),
the  position  of  the  law  relating  to    talaq  ,
where  it  is  contested  by  either  spouse,  is
that, if it has to take effect, first of all the
pronouncement of   talaq   must be proved (it is
not sufficient to merely state in court in a
written statement or in some other pleading
that   talaq   was given at some earlier point of
time), then reasonable cause must be shown
as also the attempt at reconciliation must be
demonstrated to have taken place… .”
(Emphasis supplied)
30522.As recently as in 2016, Mustaque, J. of the
High  Court  of  Kerala  in  Nazeer  @  Oyoor
Nazeer v. Shemeema  77, has inter alia referred
to  Shamim  Ara  and  has  disapproved  triple
talaq. 
 23.Therefore,  I  find  it  extremely  difficult  to
agree with the learned Chief Justice that the
practice  of  triple  talaq  has  to  be  considered
integral  to  the  religious  denomination  in
question  and  that  the  same  is  part  of  their
personal law. 
24.T o  freely  profess,  practice  and  propagate
religion of one’s choice is a Fundamental Right
guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. That
is subject only to the following- (1) public order,
(2) health, (3) morality and (4) other provisions
of  Part  III  dealing  with  Fundamental  Rights.
Under Article 25 (2) of the Constitution of India,
the State is also granted power to make law in
two contingencies notwithstanding the freedom
granted under Article 25(1). Article 25 (2) states
that  “nothing  in  this  Article  shall  affect  the
77
306operation  of  any existing  law  or  prevent  the
State from making any law- (a) regulating or
restricting any economic, financial, political or
other secular activity which may be associated
with religious practice; (b) providing for social
welfare  and  reform  or  the  throwing  open  of
Hindu religious institutions of a public character
to all classes and sections of Hindus.” Except to
the above extent, the freedom of religion under
the Constitution of India is absolute and on this
point, I am in full agreement with the learned
Chief Justice. However, on the statement that
triple talaq is an integral part of the religious
practice, I respectfully disagree. Merely because
a practice has continued for long, that by itself
cannot make it valid if it has been expressly
declared  to  be  impermissible.  The  whole
purpose of the 1937 Act was to declare Shariat
as  the  rule  of  decision  and  to  discontinue
anti-Shariat practices with respect to subjects
enumerated in Section 2 which include talaq.
Therefore, in any case, after the introduction of
the 1937 Act, no practice against the tenets of
307Quran is permissible. Hence, there cannot be
any Constitutional protection to such a practice
and thus,  my disagreement  with  the  learned
Chief  Justice  for  the  constitutional  protection
given to triple talaq. I also have serious doubts
as  to  whether,  even  under  Article  142,  the
exercise  of  a  Fundamental  Right  can  be
injuncted.
25.When  issues  of  such  nature  come  to  the
forefront, the discourse often takes the form of
pitting  religion  against  other  constitutional
rights. I believe that a reconciliation between
the  same  is  possible,  but  the  process  of
harmonizing  different  interests  is  within  the
powers of the legislature. Of course, this power
has  to  be  exercised  within  the  constitutional
parameters  without  curbing  the  religious
freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of
India. However, it is not for the Courts to direct
for any legislation.
26.Fortunately, this Court has done its part in
Shamim  Ara .  I  expressly  endorse  and
308re-iterate  the  law  declared  in  Shamim  Ara .
What is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot
be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is
bad in theology is bad in law as well.

R.F. Nariman, J.
Having perused a copy of the learned Chief Justice’s
judgment,  I am in respectful disagreement with the
same. 
1.This  matter  has  found  its  way  to  a  Constitution
Bench of this Court because of certain newspaper
311articles  which  a  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  in
Prakash  v. Phulavati, (2016) 2 SCC 36 , adverted
to, and then stated:
“28. An  important  issue  of  gender
discrimination  which  though  not  directly
involved in this appeal, has been raised by
some of the learned counsel for the parties
which  concerns  rights  of  Muslim  women.
Discussions on gender discrimination led to
this issue also. It was pointed out that in
spite  of  guarantee  of  the  Constitution,
Muslim  women  are  subjected  to
discrimination.  There  is  no  safeguard
against  arbitrary  divorce  and  second
marriage by her husband during currency
of the first marriage, resulting in denial of
dignity  and  security  to  her. Although  the
issue  was  raised  before  this  Court
in Ahmedabad  Women  Action  Group
(AWAG) v. Union  of  India  [Ahmedabad
Women Action Group (AWAG)  v. Union of
India, (1997) 3 SCC 573], this Court did not
go into the merits of the discrimination with
the  observation  that  the  issue  involved
State  policy  to  be  dealt  with  by  the
legislature.  [This  Court  referred  to  the
observations  of  Sahai,  J.  in  Sarla
Mudgal v. Union of India, (1995) 3 SCC 635
: 1995 SCC (Cri) 569 that a climate was
required to be built for a uniform civil code.
Reference was also made to observations
in Madhu Kishwar  v. State of Bihar, (1996)
5  SCC  125  to  the  effect  that  the  Court
could at best advise and focus attention to
the problem instead of playing an activist
role.] It was observed that challenge to the
Muslim  Women  (Protection  of  Rights  on
Divorce) Act, 1986 was pending before the
Constitution  Bench  and  there  was  no
reason to multiply proceedings on such an
issue.
31231. It was, thus, submitted that this aspect
of  the  matter  may  be  gone  into  by
separately registering the matter as public
interest litigation (PIL). We are of the view
that the suggestion needs consideration in
view of the earlier decisions of this Court.
The  issue  has  also  been  highlighted  in
recent articles appearing in the press on
this subject. [The Tribune dated 24-9-2015
“Muslim  Women’s  Quest  for  Equality”  by
Vandana  Shukla  and  Sunday  Express
Magazine  dated 4-10-2015 “In Her Court”
by Dipti Nagpaul D’Souza.]
32. For this purpose, a PIL be separately
registered  and  put  up  before  the
appropriate Bench as per orders of Hon’ble
the Chief Justice of India.”
(at pages 53 and 55)
        Several writ petitions have thereafter been filed
and are before us seeking in different forms the same
relief – namely, that a Triple Talaq at one go by a
Muslim husband which severs the marital bond is bad
in constitutional law.  
2.Wide  ranging  arguments  have  been  made  by
various counsel appearing for the parties.  These
have been referred to in great detail in the judgment
of  the  learned  Chief  Justice.   In  essence,  the
petitioners, supported by the Union of India, state
that Triple Talaq is an anachronism in today’s day
and age and, constitutionally speaking, is anathema.
313Gender discrimination is put at the forefront of the
argument, and it is stated that even though Triple
Talaq  may  be  sanctioned  by  the  Shariat  law  as
applicable to Sunni Muslims in India, it is violative of
Muslim  women’s fundamental  rights  to  be  found,
more particularly, in Articles 14, 15(1) and 21 of the
Constitution of India.  Opposing this, counsel for the
Muslim Personal Board and others who supported
them, then relied heavily upon a Bombay High Court
judgment, being State of Bombay  v. Narasu Appa
Mali, AIR  1952  Bom  84,  for  the  proposition  that
personal  laws  are  beyond  the  pale  of  the
fundamental rights Chapter of the Constitution and
hence  cannot  be  struck  down  by  this  Court.
According to them, in this view of the matter, this
Court should fold its hands and send Muslim women
and  other  women’s  organisations  back  to  the
legislature, as according to them, if Triple Talaq is to
be removed as  a  measure of  social  welfare  and
reform  under  Article  25(2),  the  legislature  alone
should do so.  To this, the counter argument of the
other  side  is  that  Muslim  personal  laws  are  not
being attacked as such.  What is the subject matter
314of attack in these matters is a statute, namely, the
Muslim Personal Law ( Shariat) Application Act, 1937
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “1937  Act”).
According  to  them,  Triple  Talaq  is  specifically
sanctioned by statutory law  vide Section 2 of the
1937 Act and what is sought for is a declaration that
Section 2 of the 1937 Act is constitutionally invalid to
the aforesaid extent.  To this, the Muslim Personal
Board states that Section 2 is not in order to apply
the  Muslim  law  of  Triple  Talaq,  but  is  primarily
intended to do away with custom or usage to the
contrary, as the non-obstante clause in Section 2
indicates.  Therefore, according to them, the Muslim
personal  law  of  Triple  Talaq  operates  of  its  own
force  and  cannot  be  included  in  Article  13(1)  as
“laws in force” as has been held in  Narasu Appa
(supra). 
 
3.The question, therefore, posed before this Court is
finally in a very narrow compass. Triple Talaq alone
is the subject matter of challenge – other forms of
Talaq are not.  The neat question that arises before
this Court is, therefore, whether the 1937 Act can be
said to recognize and enforce Triple Talaq as a rule
315of law to be followed by the Courts in India and if not
whether  Narasu  Appa  (supra)  which  states  that
personal  laws  are  outside  Article  13(1)  of  the
Constitution is correct in law. 
4.Inasmuch as the Muslims in India are divided into
two main sects, namely Sunnis and Shias, and this
case  pertains  only  to  Sunnis  as  Shias  do  not
recognize Triple Talaq, it is important to begin at the
very beginning. 
5.In  a  most  illuminating  introduction  to  Mulla’s
Principles  of  Mahomedan  Law  (16th Ed.)  (1968),
Justice Hidayatullah, after speaking about Prophet
Mahomed, has this to say:
“The  Prophet  had  established  himself  as
the  supreme  overlord  and  the  supreme
preceptor.   Arabia  was  steeped  in
ignorance and barbarism, superstition and
vice.  Female infanticide, drinking, lechery
and other vices were rampant.
However, the Prophet did not nominate a
successor.  His death was announced by
Abu Bakr and immediate action was taken
to hold an election.  As it happened, the
Chiefs of the tribe of Banu Khazraj were
holding a meeting to elect a Chief and the
Companions  went  to  the  place.  This
meeting  elected  Abu  Bakr  as  the
successor.  The  next  day  Abu  Bakr
ascended the pulpit and everyone took an
oath of allegiance ( Bai’at).  
316This  election  led  to  the  great  schism
between  the  Sunnis  and  Shias.  The
Koreish tribe was divided into Ommayads
and  Hashimites.  The  Hashimites  were
named after Hashim the great grand-father
of the Prophet.  There was bitter enmity
between  the  Ommayads  and  the
Hashimites.  The  Hashimites  favoured  the
succession of Ali and claimed that he ought
to  have  been  chosen  because  of
appointment  by  the  Prophet  and
propinquity to him. The election in fact took
place when the household of the Prophet
(including  Ali)  was  engaged  in  the
obsequies.  This offended the Hashimites.
It may, however, be said that Ali, regardless
of  his  own  claims,  immediately  swore
allegiance to Abu Bakr.  Ali was not set up
when  the  second  and  third  elections  of
Omar and Osman took place, but he never
went against these decisions and accepted
the new Caliph each time and gave him
unstinted support.
Abu  Bakr  was  sixty  years  old  and  was
Caliph  only  for  two  years  (d.  634  A.D.).
Even  when  he  was  Caliph,  the  power
behind him was Omar Ibnul Khattab. It is
said  that  Abu  Bakr  named  Omar  as  his
successor.  Even if this be not true, it is
obvious  that  the  election  was  a  mere
formality. Omar was assassinated after ten
years as Caliph (644 A.D.).  Osman was
elected as the third Caliph.  Tradition is that
Omar had formed an inner panel of electors
(six in number), but this is discountenanced
by  some  leading  historians.   Later  this
tradition was used by the Abbasids to form
an inner conclave for their elections.  This
special election used to be accepted by the
people at a general, but somewhat formal,
election.  Osman was Caliph for 12 years
and was assassinated (656 A.D.).  Ali was
at last elected as the fourth Caliph.  The
election of the first four Caliphs, who are
317known as  Khulfai-i-Rashidin  (rightly-guided
Caliphs) was real, although it may be said
that each time the choice was such as to
leave  no  room  for  opposition.   Ali  was
Caliph for five years.  He was killed in battle
in 661 A.D.  Ali’s son Hasan resigned in
favour  of  Muavia  the  founder  of  the
Ommayad dynasty.  Hasan was, however,
murdered. The partisans of Ali persuaded
Hussain, the second son of Ali, to revolt
against Mauvia’s son Yezid, but at Kerbala,
Husain  died  fighting  after  suffering  great
privations.  The rift between the Sunnis and
the Shias (Shiat-i-Ali party of Ali) became
very great thereafter.”
6.It is in this historical setting that it is necessary to
advert to the various sub-sects of the Sunnis.  Four
major sub-sects are broadly recognized schools of
Sunni  law.   They  are  the  Hanafi  school,  Maliki
school,  Shafi’i  school  and  Hanbali  school.   The
overwhelming majority of Sunnis in India follow the
Hanafi  school  of  law.   Mulla  in  Principles  of
Mahomedan Law (20th Ed.), pg. xix to xxi, has this to
say about the Hanafi school:
“This is the most famous of the four schools
of Hanafi law.  This school was founded by
Abu Hanifa (699-767 A.D.).  The school is
also  known  as  “Kufa  School”.   Although
taught by the great Imam Jafar-as-Sadik,
the founder of the Shia School, Abu Hanifa
was,  also  a  pupil  of  Abu  Abdullah
ibn-ul-Mubarak  and  Hamid  bin-Sulaiman
and this  may account for  his founding  a
separate school.  This school was favoured
by the Abbasid Caliphs and its doctrines
spread far and wide.  Abu Hanifa earned
318the appellation “The Great Imam”.   The
school  was  fortunate  in  possessing,
besides  Abu  Hanifa,  his  two  more
celebrated pupils, Abu Yusuf (who became
the  Chief  Kazi at  Baghdad)  and  Imam
Muhammad Ash-Shaybani, a prolific writer,
who has left behind a number of books on
jurisprudence.  The founder of the school
himself  left  very  little  written  work.   The
home of this school was Iraq but it shares
this  territory  with  other  schools  although
there is a fair representation.  The Ottoman
Turks and the Seljuk Turks were Hanafis.
The  doctrines  of  this  school  spread  to
Syria,  Afghanistan,  Turkish  Central  Asia
and India.  Other names connected with the
Kufa School are Ibn Abi Layla and Safyan
Thawri.   Books  on  the  doctrines  are
al-Hidaay of  Marghinani  (translated  by
Hamilton),  Radd-al-Mukhtar  and
Durr-ul-Mukhtar  of  Ibn  Abidin  and
al-Mukhtasar of  Kuduri.   The
Fatawa-i-Alamgiri  collected in Aurangzeb’s
time  contain  the  doctrines  of  this  school
with other material.”
7.Needless to add, the Hanafi school has supported
the  practice  of  Triple  Talaq  amongst  the  Sunni
Muslims in India for many centuries. 
8.Marriage  in  Islam  is  a  contract,  and  like  other
contracts,  may  under  certain  circumstances,  be
terminated.   There  is  something  astonishingly
modern  about  this  –  no  public  declaration  is  a
condition  precedent  to  the  validity  of  a  Muslim
marriage  nor  is  any  religious  ceremony  deemed
absolutely essential, though they are usually carried
319out.   Apparently,  before  the  time  of  Prophet
Mahomed, the pagan Arab was absolutely free to
repudiate his wife on a mere whim, but after the
advent of Islam, divorce was permitted to a man if
his wife by her indocility or bad character renders
marital  life  impossible.   In  the  absence  of  good
reason, no man can justify a divorce for he then
draws  upon  himself  the  curse  of  God.   Indeed,
Prophet Mahomed had declared divorce to be the
most disliked of lawful things in the sight of God.
The  reason  for  this  is  not  far  to  seek.   Divorce
breaks the marital tie which is fundamental to family
life in Islam.  Not only does it disrupt the marital tie
between  man  and  woman,  but  it  has  severe
psychological  and  other  repercussions  on  the
children from such marriage.
9.      This  then  leads  us  to  the  forms  of  divorce
recognized in Islamic Law.  Mulla  (supra), at pages
393-395, puts it thus:
“S.311. Different modes of talak . – A talak
may  be  effected  in  any  of  the  following
ways:-
(1)Talak ahsan. – This consists of a single
pronouncement of divorce made during
a  tuhr (period  between  menstruations)
320followed  by  abstinence  from  sexual
intercourse for the period of iddat .
When  the  marriage  has  not  been
consummated, a talak in the  ahsan  form
may be pronounced even if the wife is in
her menstruation. 
Where the wife has passed the age of
periods of menstruation the requirement of
a declaration during a  tuhr is inapplicable;
furthermore, this requirement only applies
to  a  oral  divorce  and  not  a  divorce  in
writing.
Talak Ahsan is based on the following
verses of Holy Quran:  “and the divorced
woman should keep themselves in waiting
for three courses.” (II:228).
“And those of your woman who despair
of menstruation, if you have a doubt,
their prescribed time is three months,
and  of  those  too,  who  have  not  had
their courses.” (LXV: 4).
(2)Talak  hasan- This  consists  of  three
pronouncements  made  during
successive tuhrs, no intercourse taking
place during any of the three tuhrs.
         The first pronouncement should be
made during a tuhr, the second during the
next  tuhr,  and  the  third  during  the
succeeding tuhr.
Talak Hasan is based on the following
Quranic injunctions:
“Divorce  may  be  pronounced  twice,
then keep them in good fellowship or
let (them) go kindness.” (II: 229).  
“So if he (the husband) divorces her
(third time) she shall not be lawful to
him afterward until she marries another
person.” (II: 230).  
321(3)   Talak-ul-bidaat or talak-i-badai. - This
consists of –
(i)Three pronouncements made during
a single  tuhr either in one sentence,
e.g.,  “I  divorce  thee  thrice,” -  or  in
separate  sentences  e.g.,  “I  divorce
thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee”,
or 
(ii)a single pronouncement made during
a  tuhr clearly indicating an intention
irrevocably  to dissolve the marriage,
e.g., “I divorce thee irrevocably.”
Talak-us-sunnat and talak-ul-biddat
The Hanafis recognized two kinds of talak,
namely, (1)  talak-us-sunnat,  that  is,  talak
according  to  the  rules  laid  down  in  the
sunnat  (traditions) of the Prophet; and (2)
talak-ul-biddat,    that  is,  new  or  irregular
talak.   Talak-ul-biddat  was  introduced  by
the  Omeyyade  monarchs  in  the  second
century  of  the  Mahomedan  era.
Talak-ul-sunnat  is of two kinds, namely, (1)
ahsan, that is, most proper, and (2) hasan,
that  is,  proper.   The    talak-ul-biddat    or
heretical divorce is good in law, though bad
in theology and it is the most common and
prevalent mode of divorce in this country,
including Oudh.  In the case of talak ahsan
and  talak  hasan,  the  husband  has  an
opportunity  of  reconsidering  his  decision,
for the  talak  in both these cases does not
become absolute until a certain period has
elapsed (S.312), and the husband has the
option to revoke it before then.  But the
talak-ul-biddat  becomes  irrevocable
immediately it is pronounced (S.312).  The
essential feature of a  talak-ul-biddat  is its
irrevocability.  One of tests of irrevocability
is the repetition three times  of the formula
322of divorce  within one tuhr.   But the triple
repetition is not a necessary condition of
talak-ul-biddat, and the intention to render a
talak  irrevocable may be expressed even
by a single declaration.  Thus if a man says
“I  have  divorced  you  by  a  talak-ul-bain
(irrevocable  divorce)”,  the  talak is
talak-ul-biddat or  talak-i-badai and  it  will
take  effect  immediately  it  is  pronounced,
though  it  may  be  pronounced  but  once.
Here  the  use  of  the  expression  “ bain”
(irrevocable) manifests of itself the intention
to effect an irrevocable divorce.”

10.Another noted author, A.A.A. Fyzee, in his
book  “Outlines  of  Muhammadan  Law”  (5th Ed.),  at
pages 120-122, puts it thus:
“The pronouncement of talaq may be either
revocable or irrevocable.  As the Prophet of
Islam did not favour the institution of talaq,
the revocable forms of talaq are considered
as the ‘approved’ and the irrevocable forms
are treated as the ‘disapproved’ forms.  A
revocable pronouncement of divorce gives
a  locus poenitentiae to  the  man;  but  an
irrevocable  pronouncement  leads  to  an
undesirable  result  without  a  chance  to
reconsider the question.  If this principle is
kept  in  mind  the  terminology  is  easily
understood.  The forms  of  talaq may be
classified as follows:
(a)talaq al-sunna (i.e., in conformity with the
dictates of the Prophet) – 
(i)  ahsan (the most approved), (ii)  hasan
(approved). 
(b)  talaq  al-bid’a   (i.e.,  of  innovation;
therefore  not  approved)  –  (i)  three
declarations (the so-called triple divorce) at
one  time,  (ii)  one  irrevocable  declaration
(generally in writing). 
323The  talaq  al-sunna ,  most  approved  form
consists of one single pronouncement in a
period of tuhr (purity, i.e., when the woman
is  free  from  her  menstrual  courses),
followed  by  abstinence  from  sexual
intercourse  during  that  period  of  sexual
purity (tuhr) as well as during the whole of
the  iddat.  If  any such intercourse  takes
place  during  the  periods  mentioned,  the
divorce  is  void  and  of  no  effect  in  Ithna
Ashari and Fatimi laws.  It is this mode or
procedure  which  seems  to  have  been
approved by the Prophet at the beginning
of  his  ministry  and  is  consequently
regarded  as  the  regular  or  proper  and
orthodox form of divorce.  
Where the parties have been away from
each other for a long time, or where the
wife  is  old  and  beyond  the  age  of
menstruation,  the  condition  of  tuhr is
unnecessary. 
A pronouncement made in the ashan form
is revocable during  iddat.  This period is
three  months  from  the  date  of  the
declaration or, if the woman is pregnant,
until delivery.  The husband may revoke the
divorce at any time during the iddat.  Such
revocation may be by express words or by
conduct.   Resumption  of  conjugal
intercourse is a clear case of revocation.
For  instance,  H pronounces  a  single
revocable  talaq against his wife and then
says ‘I have retained thee’ or cohabits with
her, the divorce is revoked under Hanafi as
well  as  Ithna  Ashari  law.   After  the
expiration of the iddat the divorce becomes
irrevocable. 
A Muslim wife after divorce is entitled to
maintenance during the iddat, and so also
her child in certain circumstances. 
The hasan form of talaq, also an approved
form  but  less  approved  than  the  first
(ahsan),  consists  of  three  successive
pronouncements during three consecutive
periods  of  purity  ( tuhr).   Each  of  these
324pronouncements should have been made
at a time when no intercourse has taken
place during that particular period of purity.
The  hasan form  of  talaq requires  some
explanation  and  a  concrete  illustration
should  suffice.   The  husband  (H)
pronounces  talaq on his wife (W) for the
first time during a period when W is free
from her menstrual courses.  The husband
and wife had not come together during this
period of purity.  This is the first talaq. H
resumes cohabitation or revokes this first
talaq in this period of purity.  Thereafter in
the  following  period  of  purity,  at  a  time
when  no  intercourse  has  taken  place,  H
pronounces the second talaq.  This talaq is
again  revoked  by  express  words  or  by
conduct  and  the  third  period  of  purity  is
entered  into.   In  this  period,  while  no
intercourse having taken place, H for the
third  time  pronounces  the  formula  of
divorce.    This  third  pronouncement
operates in law as a final and irrevocable
dissolution of the marital tie.  The marriage
is  dissolved;  sexual  intercourse  becomes
unlawful;  iddat becomes  incumbent;
remarriage  between  the  parties  becomes
impossible  unless  W  lawfully  marries
another husband, and that other husband
lawfully divorces her after the marriage has
been actually consummated. 
Thus it is clear that in these two forms there
is a chance for the parties to be reconciled
by the intervention of friends or otherwise.
They are, therefore, the ‘approved’ forms
and are recognized both by Sunni and Shia
laws.   The  Ithna  Ashari  and  the  Fatimi
schools,  however,  do  not  recognize  the
remaining two forms and thus preserve the
ancient  conventions  of  the  times  of  the
Law-giver. 
The first, or ahsan, form is ‘most approved’
because  the  husband  behaves  in  a
gentlemanly manner and does not treat the
wife as a chattel.  The second is a form in
325which the Prophet tried to put an end to a
barbarous  pre-Islamic  practice.   This
practice was to divorce a wife and take her
back several times in order to ill-treat her.
The Prophet, by the rule of the irrevocability
of  the  third  pronouncement,  indicated
clearly that such a practice could not be
continued  indefinitely. Thus  if  a  husband
really  wished  to  take  the  wife  back  he
should  do  so;  if  not,  the  third
pronouncement  after  two  reconciliations
would operate as a final bar.  These rules of
law  follow  the  spirit  of  the  Quranic
injunction: ‘when they have reached their
term take them back in kindness or part
from them in kindness’.
A disapproved form of divorce is    talaq   by
triple  declarations  in  which  three
pronouncements are made in a single   tuhr  ,
either in one sentence e.g. ‘I divorce thee
triply  or  thrice’  or  in  three  sentences  ‘I
divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee.’
Such a    talaq   is lawful, although sinful, in
Hanafi  law;  but  in  Ithna  Ashari  and  the
Fatimi laws it is not permissible.  This is
called talaq al-ba’in, irrevocable divorce. 
Another form of the disapproved divorce is
a single, irrevocable pronouncement made
either  during  the  period  of  tuhr or  even
otherwise.  This form is also called  talaq
al-ba’in and may be given in writing.  Such
a ‘bill of divorcement’ comes into operation
immediately  and  severs  the  marital  tie.
This form is not recognized by the Ithna
Ashari or the Fatimi schools.”

11.   It  is  at  this  stage  that  the  1937  Act  needs
consideration.  The Statement of Objects and Reasons
of this Act are as follows:
“For  several  years  past  it  has  been  the
cherished desire of the Muslims of British
326India  that  Customary  Law  should  in  no
case take the place of Muslim Personal
Law.  The  matter  has  been  repeatedly
agitated  in  the  press  as  well  as  on  the
platform. The Jamiat-ul-Ulema-i-Hind, the
greatest  Moslem  religious  body  has
supported  the  demand  and  invited  the
attention  of  all  concerned  to  the  urgent
necessity of introducing a measure to this
effect. Customary Law is a misnomer in as
much  as  it  has  not  any sound  basis  to
stand  upon  and  is  very  much  liable  to
frequent changes and cannot be expected
to  attain  at  any  time  in  the  future  that
certainty and definiteness which must be
the characteristic of all laws. The status of
Muslim  women  under  the  so-called
Customary Law is simply disgraceful. All
the  Muslim  Women  Organisations  have
therefore condemned the Customary Law
as  it  adversely affects  their  rights.  They
demand  that  the  Muslim  Personal  Law
(  Shariat  )  should  be  made  applicable  to
them. The introduction of Muslim Personal
Law will  automatically raise  them  to  the
position to which they are naurally entitled.
In  addition  to  this  present  measure,  if
enacted, would have very salutary effect
on  society  because  it  would  ensure
certainty  and  definiteness  in  the  mutual
rights and obligations of the public. Muslim
Personal Law ( Shariat) exists in the form
of a veritable code and is too well known
to admit of any doubt or to entail any great
labour in the shape of research, which is
the chief feature of Customary Law.”
[Emphasis Supplied]
12.It is a short Act consisting of 6 Sections.  We
are directly concerned in these cases with Section 2.
Section 2 of the 1937 Act states:
327“2.  Application  of  Personal  law  to
Muslims. - Notwithstanding any custom or
usage to the contrary, in all questions (save
questions  relating  to  agricultural  land)
regarding  intestate  succession,  special
property  of  females,  including  personal
properly  inherited  or  obtained  under
contract  or  gift  or  any other  provision  of
Personal  Law,  marriage,  dissolution  of
marriage,  including  talaq,  ila,  zihar,  lian,
khula and  mubaraat, maintenance, dower,
guardianship,  gifts,  trusts  and  trust
properties, and  wakfs (other than charities
and  charitable  institutions  and  charitable
and  religious  endowments)  the  rule  of
decision  in  cases  where  the  parties  are
Muslims shall be the Muslim Personal Law
(Shariat).”
13.A word as to the meaning of the expression
“Shariat”.  A.A.A.  Fyzee  (supra),  at  pages  9-11,
describes “Shariat” as follows: 
“Coming to law proper, it is necessary to
remember  that  there  are  two  different
conceptions of law.  Law may be considered
to be of divine origin, as is the case with the
Hindu law and the Islamic law, or it may be
conceived  as  man-made.   The  latter
conception  is  the  guiding  principle  of  all
modern  legislation;  it  is,  as  Ostrorog  has
pointed  out,  the  Greek,  Roman,  Celtic  or
Germanic  notion  of  law.   We  may  be
compelled to act in accordance with certain
principles because God desires us to do so,
or in the alternative because the King or the
Assembly of wise men or the leader of the
community or social custom demand it of
us, for the good of the people in general.  In
the case of Hindu law, it is based first on the
Vedas  or  Sruti (that  which  is  heard);
secondly  on  the  Smriti (that  which  is
remembered  by  the  sages  or  rishis).
328Although the effect of custom is undoubtedly
great  yet  dharma,  as  defined  by  Hindu
lawyers, implies a course of conduct which
is approved by God. 
Now, what is the Islamic notion of law? In
the words of Justice Mahmood, ‘It is to be
remembered that Hindu and Muhammadan
law  are  so  intimately  connected  with
religion  that  they  cannot  readily  be
dissevered  from it’.   There is  in Islam a
doctrine of ‘certitude’ ( ilm al-yaqin) in the
matter  of  Good  and  Evil.   We  in  our
weakness  cannot  understand  what  Good
and Evil are unless we are guided in the
matter by an inspired Prophet.  Good and
Evil – husn (beauty) and qubh (ugliness) –
are to be taken in the ethical acceptation of
the terms.  What is morally beautiful that
must  be  done;  and  what  is  morally ugly
must not be done.  That is law or  Shariat
and nothing else can be law.  But what is
absolutely  and  indubitably  beautiful,  and
what  is  absolutely  and  indubitably  ugly?
These  are  the  important  legal  questions;
and who can answer them? Certainly not
man, say the Muslim legists.  We have the
Qur’an  which  is  the  very  word  of  God.
Supplementary to it we have Hadith which
are Traditions of the Prophet – the records
of his actions and his sayings – from which
we  must  derive  help  and  inspiration  in
arriving  at  legal  decisions.   If  there  is
nothing either in the Qur’an or in the Hadith
to answer the particular question which is
before us, we have to follow the dictates of
secular reason in accordance with certain
definite  principles.   These  principles
constitute  the  basis  of  sacred  law  or
Shariat as the Muslim doctors understand
it.   And  it  is  these  fundamental  juristic
notions  which  we  must  try  to  study  and
analyse before we approach the study of
the Islamic civil law as a whole, or even
that small part of it which in India is known
as Muslim law. 
329Modern jurists emphasize the importance
of law for understanding the character and
ethos of a people.  Law, says a modern
jurist, ‘streams from the soul of a people
like  national  poetry, it  is  as  holy  as  the
national religion, it grows and spreads like
language;  religious,  ethical,  and  poetical
elements all contribute to its vital force’; it is
‘the distilled essence of the civilization of a
people’; it reflects the people’s soul more
clearly than any other organism.  This is
true of Islam more than of any other faith.
The Shari’at is the central core of Islam; no
understanding  of  its  civilization,  its  social
history or  its political system,  is  possible
without a knowledge and appreciation of its
legal system. 
Shariat (lit., the road to the watering place,
the path to be followed) as a technical term
means the Canon law of Islam, the totality
of  Allah’s commandments.   Each  one  of
such  commandments  is  called  hukm (pl.
ahkam).   The  law  of  Allah  and  its  inner
meaning is not easy to grasp; and Shariat
embraces  all  human  actions.   For  this
reason it is not ‘law’ in the modern sense; it
contains an infallible guide to ethics.  It is
fundamentally a Doctrine of Duties, a code
of  obligations.  Legal  considerations  and
individual rights have a secondary place in
it;  above  all  the  tendency  towards  a
religious evaluation of all the affairs of life is
supreme. 
According  to  the  Shariat religious
injunctions  are  of  five  kinds,  al-ahkam
al-khamsah.   Those  strictly  enjoined  are
farz, and those strictly forbidden are haram.
Between  them  we  have  two  middle
categories, namely, things  which  you  are
advised to do ( mandub), and things which
you are advised to refrain from ( makruh)
and  finally  there  are  things  about  which
religion  is  indifferent  ( ja’iz).   The  daily
prayers, five in number, are  farz; wine is
haram; the addition prayers like those on
330the  Eid are  mandub; certain kinds of fish
are  makruh;  and  there  are  thousands  of
ja’iz things such as travelling by air.  Thus
the Shariat is totalitarian; all human activity
is embraced in its sovereign domain.  This
fivefold division must be carefully noted; for
unless  this  is  done  it  is  impossible  to
understand  the  distinction  between  that
which  is  only  morally  enjoined  and  that
which is legally enforced. Obviously, moral
obligation  is  quite  a  different  thing  from
legal  necessity  and  if  in  law  these
distinctions are not kept in mind error and
confusion are the inevitable result.”
14.It  can  be  seen  that  the  1937  Act  is  a
pre-constitutional legislative measure which would fall
directly within Article 13(1) of the Constitution of India,
which reads as under:
“Article 13 - Laws inconsistent with or in
derogation  of the fundamental rights -
(1) All laws in force in the territory of India
immediately before the commencement of
this  Constitution,  in  so  far  as  they  are
inconsistent with the provisions of this part,
shall, to the extent of such inconsistency,
be void.
(2)xxxxxxxxx
(3)  In  this  article,  unless  the  context
otherwise requires,-
(a)  “law”  includes  any  Ordinance,  order,
bye-law,  rule,  regulation,  notification,
custom or usage having in the territory of
India the force of law;
(b) “laws in force” includes laws passed or
made by a Legislature or other competent
authority in the territory of India before the
commencement of this Constitution and not
previously  repealed,  notwithstanding  that
any such law or any part thereof may not
331be  then  in  operation  either  at  all  or  in
particular areas.”
15.However,  learned  counsel  for  the  Muslim
Personal Board as well as other counsel supporting
their  stand  have  argued  that,  read  in  light  of  the
Objects and Reasons, the 1937 Act was not meant to
enforce Muslim personal law, which was enforceable
by itself through the Courts in India. The 1937 Act was
only meant, as the non-obstante clause in Section 2
indicates, to do away with custom or usage which is
contrary to Muslim personal law.  
16.We are afraid that such a constricted reading
of the statute would be impermissible in law. True, the
Objects and Reasons of a statute throw light on the
background in which the statute was enacted, but it is
difficult to read the non-obstante clause of Section 2 as
governing the enacting part of the Section, or otherwise
it will become a case of the tail wagging the dog.  A
similar attempt was made many years ago and rejected
in  Aswini  Kumar  Ghosh  v. Arabinda  Bose , 1953
SCR 1.  This Court was concerned with Section 2 of
the Supreme Court Advocates (Practice in High Courts)
Act, 1951.   Section 2 of the said Act read as follows:
332“Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Indian Bar Councils Act, 1926, or in any
other law regulating the conditions subject
to which a person not entered in the roll of
Advocates  of  a  High  Court  may,  be
permitted  to  practice  in  that  High  Court
every Advocate of the Supreme Court shall
be entitled as of  right to practice  in any
High  Court  whether  or  not  he  is  an
Advocate of that High Court:
Provided that nothing in this section shall
be deemed to entitle any person, merely by
reason  of  his  being  an  Advocate  of  the
Supreme  Court,  to  practice  in  any  High
Court of which he was at any time a judge,
if  he  had  given  an  undertaking  not  to
practice therein after ceasing to hold office
as such judge.”
17.The argument made before this Court was
that the non-obstante clause furnishes the key to the
proper interpretation of the scope of the Section and
the enacting clause must, therefore, be construed as
conferring only a right co-extensive with the disability
removed by the opening clause.  This argument was
rejected by this Court as follows:
“23.  Turning  now  to  the  non  obstante
clause in section 2 of the new Act, which
appears to have furnished the whole basis
for the reasoning of the Court below — and
the  argument  before  us  closely  followed
that  reasoning  —  we  find  the  learned
Judges  begin  by  inquiring  what  are  the
provisions  which  that  clause  seeks  to
supersede  and  then  place  upon  the
enacting clause such construction as would
make the right conferred by it co-extensive
with  the  disability  imposed  by  the
333superseded  provisions.  “The  meaning  of
the  section  will  become  clearer”,  they
observe, “if we examine a little more closely
what  the  section  in  fact  supersedes  or
repeals.....The disability which the section
removes and the right which it confers are
co-extensive.” This is not, in our judgment,
a correct approach to the construction of
section  2.  It  should  first  be  ascertained
what  the  enacting  part  of  the  section
provides on a fair construction of the words
used according to their natural and ordinary
meaning, and the non obstante clause is to
be understood as operating to set aside as
no  longer  valid  anything  contained  in
relevant existing laws which is inconsistent
with the new enactment.”
(at pages 21-22)
This  view  was  followed  in  A.V. Fernandez  v.
State of Kerala,  1957 SCR 837 at 850.  
18.It is, therefore, clear that all forms of Talaq
recognized and enforced by Muslim personal law are
recognized and enforced by the 1937 Act.  This would
necessarily include Triple Talaq when it comes to the
Muslim  personal  law  applicable  to  Sunnis  in  India.
Therefore, it is very difficult to accept the argument on
behalf of the Muslim Personal Board that Section 2
does not recognize or enforce Triple Talaq.  It clearly
and obviously does both, because the Section makes
Triple Talaq “the rule of decision in cases where the
parties are Muslims”.
33419.As we have concluded that the 1937 Act is a
law  made  by the  legislature  before  the  Constitution
came  into  force,  it  would  fall  squarely  within  the
expression “laws in force” in Article 13(3)(b) and would
be hit by Article 13(1) if found to be inconsistent with
the  provisions  of  Part  III  of  the  Constitution,  to  the
extent of such inconsistency.
20.At this stage, it is necessary to refer to the
recognition of Triple Talaq as a legal form of divorce in
India,  as  applicable  to  Sunni  Muslims.   In  an  early
Bombay  case,  Sarabai  v. Rabiabai,  (1906)  ILR  30
Bom 537, Bachelor, J. referred to Triple Talaq and said
that “it is good in law though bad in theology”.  In a
Privy Council decision in 1932, 5 years before the 1937
Act,  namely  Rashid  Ahmad  v. Anisa  Khatun ,
(1931-32) 59 IA  21: AIR 1932 PC 25, the Privy Council
was squarely called upon to adjudicate upon a Triple
Talaq.  Lord Thankerton speaking for the Privy Council
put it thus:
“There is nothing in the case to suggest
that the parties are not Sunni Mahomedans
governed by the ordinary Hanafi law, and,
in the opinion of their Lordships, the law of
divorce  applicable  in  such  a  case  is
correctly stated by Sir R.K Wilson, in his
335Digest  of  Anglo-Muhammadan  Law,  5th
ed.,  at  p.  136,  as  follows:  “The  divorce
called talak may be either irrevocable ( bain)
or  revocable  ( raja).  A talak  bain,  while  it
always  operates  as  an  immediate  and
complete dissolution of the marriage bond,
differs  as  to  one  of  its  ulterior  effects
according  to  the  form  in  which  it  is
pronounced. A  talak bain may be effected
by  words  addressed  to  the  wife  clearly
indicating  an  intention  to  dissolve  the
marriage,  either:—( a)  Once,  followed  by
abstinence from sexual intercourse, for the
period called the  iddat; or (b) Three times
during  successive  intervals  of  purity,  i.e,
between  successive  menstruations,  no
intercourse taking place during any of the
three intervals; or ( c) Three times at shorter
intervals, or even in immediate succession;
or  (d)  Once,  by  words  showing  a  clear
intention that the divorce shall immediately
became irrevocable. The first-named of the
above methods is called  ahsan (best), the
second hasan (good), the third and fourth
are  said  to  be  bidaat (sinful),  but  are,
nevertheless,  regarded  by  Sunni  lawyers
as legally valid.” 
                                     (at page 26)
The Privy Council went on to state:
“Their  Lordships  are  of  opinion  that  the
pronouncement  of  the  triple  talak  by
Ghiyas-ud-din  constituted  an  immediately
effective  divorce,  and,  while  they  are
satisfied  that  the  High  Court  were  not
justified  in  such  a  conclusion  on  the
evidence in the present case, they are of
opinion that the validity and effectiveness of
the  divorce  would  not  be  affected  by
Ghiyas-ud-din’s  mental  intention  that  it
should not be a genuine divorce, as such a
view  is  contrary  to  all  authority.  A talak
actually pronounced under compulsion or in
jest is valid and effective: Baillie’s Digest,
2nd ed., p. 208; Ameer Ali’s Mohammedan
336Law,  3rd  ed.,  vol.  ii.,  p.  518;  Hamilton’s
Hedaya, vol. i., p. 211.” 
(at page 27)
21.It is thus clear that it is this view of the law
which the 1937 Act both recognizes and enforces so as
to  come  within  the  purview  of  Article  13(1)  of  the
Constitution.  
22. In this view of the matter, it is unnecessary for us to
decide whether the judgment in Narasu Appa (supra)
is good law.  However, in a suitable case, it may be
necessary to have a re-look at this judgment in that the
definition of “law” and “laws in force” are both inclusive
definitions, and that at least one part of the judgment of
P.B.  Gajendragadkar,  J.,  (para  26),  in  which  the
learned Judge opines that the expression “law” cannot
be read into the expression “laws in force” in Article
13(3) is itself no longer good law – See Sant Ram &
Ors. v. Labh Singh & Ors., (1964) 7 SCR 756.
23.It  has  been  argued  somewhat  faintly  that
Triple Talaq would be an essential part of the Islamic
faith and would, therefore, be protected by Article 25 of
the Constitution of India.  Article 25 reads as follows:
“Article 25 - Freedom of conscience and
free  profession,  practice  and
propagation of religion.-
337(1)  Subject  to  public  order, morality  and
health and to the other provisions of this
Part,  all  persons  are  equally  entitled  to
freedom of conscience and the right freely
to profess, practise and propagate religion.
(2) Nothing in this article shall affect the
operation of any existing law or prevent the
State from making any law—
(a) regulating or restricting any economic,
financial, political or other secular activity
which  may  be  associated  with  religious
practice;
(b) providing for social welfare and reform
or  the  throwing  open  of  Hindu  religious
institutions  of  a  public  character  to  all
classes and sections of Hindus.
Explanation I.—The wearing and carrying
of kirpans shall be deemed to be included
in the profession of the Sikh religion.
Explanation II.—In sub-clause (b) of clause
(2),  the  reference  to  Hindus  shall  be
construed  as  including  a  reference  to
persons  professing  the  Sikh,  Jaina  or
Buddhist  religion,  and  the  reference  to
Hindu  religious  institutions  shall  be
construed accordingly.”
24.“Religion”  has  been  given  the  widest
possible  meaning  by  this  Court  in  Commissioner,
Hindu  Religious  Endowments,  Madras  v. Sri
Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt ,
1954  SCR  1005  at  1023-1024.  In  this  country,
therefore, atheism would also form part of “religion”.
But one important caveat has been entered by this
Court, namely, that only what is an essential religious
practice is protected under Article 25.  A few decisions
338have laid down what constitutes an essential religious
practice. Thus, in Javed v. State of Haryana , 2003 (8)
SCC 369, this Court stated as under:
“60. Looked  at  from  any  angle,  the
challenge  to  the  constitutional  validity  of
Section 175(1)( q) and Section 177(1) must
fail. The right to contest an election for any
office in Panchayat is neither fundamental
nor a common law right. It is the creature of
a  statute  and  is  obviously  subject  to
qualifications and disqualifications enacted
by  legislation.  It  may  be  permissible  for
Muslims to enter into four marriages with
four  women  and  for  anyone  whether  a
Muslim  or  belonging  to  any  other
community or religion to procreate as many
children as he likes but no religion in India
dictates or mandates as  an  obligation to
enter into bigamy or polygamy or to have
children more than one. What is permitted
or  not  prohibited  by  a  religion  does  not
become a religious practice or a positive
tenet  of  a  religion.  A  practice  does  not
acquire  the  sanction  of  religion  simply
because  it  is  permitted.  Assuming  the
practice of having more wives than one or
procreating  more  children  than  one  is  a
practice  followed  by  any  community  or
group of people, the same can be regulated
or prohibited by legislation in the interest of
public order, morality and health or by any
law providing for social welfare and reform
which  the  impugned  legislation  clearly
does.”
(at page 394)
And  in  Commissioner  of  Police  v. Acharya
Jagdishwarananda Avadhuta, 2004 (12) SCC 770, it
was stated as under:
339“9. The  protection  guaranteed  under
Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution is not
confined to matters of doctrine or belief but
extends  to  acts  done  in  pursuance  of
religion  and,  therefore,  contains  a
guarantee  for  rituals,  observances,
ceremonies and modes of worship which
are  essential  or  integral  part  of  religion.
What  constitutes  an  integral  or  essential
part of religion has to be determined with
reference to its doctrines, practices, tenets,
historical  background,  etc.  of  the  given
religion.  (See  generally  the  Constitution
Bench  decisions  in  Commr.,  H.R.E.  v. Sri
Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur
Mutt [AIR  1954  SC  282  :  1954  SCR
1005], Sardar  Syedna  Taher  Saifuddin
Saheb v. State  of  Bombay  [AIR  1962  SC
853  :  1962  Supp  (2)  SCR  496]
and Seshammal v. State  of  T.N. [(1972)  2
SCC  11 :  AIR  1972  SC  1586]  regarding
those aspects that are to be looked into so
as to determine whether a part or practice
is essential or not.) What is meant by “an
essential part or practices of a religion” is
now  the  matter  for  elucidation.  Essential
part of a religion means the core beliefs
upon which a religion is founded. Essential
practice  means  those  practices  that  are
fundamental to follow a religious belief. It is
upon the cornerstone of essential parts or
practices  that  the  superstructure  of  a
religion is built, without which a religion will
be no religion. Test to determine whether a
part or practice is essential to a religion is
to find out whether the nature of the religion
will  be  changed  without  that  part  or
practice. If the taking away of that part or
practice  could  result  in  a  fundamental
change in the character of that religion or in
its belief, then such part could be treated as
an essential or integral part. There cannot
be additions or subtractions to such part
because  it  is  the  very  essence  of  that
religion  and  alterations  will  change  its
340fundamental  character.  It  is  such
permanent  essential  parts  which  are
protected by the Constitution. Nobody can
say  that  an  essential  part  or  practice  of
one’s religion has changed from a particular
date or by an event. Such alterable parts or
practices  are  definitely  not  the  “core”  of
religion whereupon the belief is based and
religion is founded upon. They could only
be treated as mere embellishments to the
non-essential  ( sic essential)  part  or
practices.”
(at pages 782-783)
25.Applying the aforesaid tests, it is clear that
Triple Talaq is only a form of Talaq which is permissible
in law, but at the same time, stated to be sinful by the
very Hanafi  school which  tolerates  it.  According  to
Javed  (supra), therefore, this would not form part of
any essential religious practice. Applying the test stated
in  Acharya Jagdishwarananda  (supra),  it is equally
clear  that  the  fundamental  nature  of  the  Islamic
religion,  as  seen  through  an  Indian  Sunni  Muslim’s
eyes,  will  not  change  without  this  practice.  Indeed,
Islam divides all human action into five kinds, as has
been stated by Hidayatullah, J. in his introduction to
Mulla (supra).  There it is stated:
“E.   Degrees of obedience : Islam divides all
actions into five kinds which figure differently in
the  sight  of  God  and  in  respect  of  which  His
Commands are different.  This plays an important
part in the lives of Muslims.
341(i)First degree: Fard.  Whatever is commanded in
the Koran, Hadis or ijmaa must be obeyed.
Wajib. Perhaps a little less compulsory than
Fard but only slightly less so.
(ii)Second  degree:  Masnun,  Mandub  and
Mustahab: These are recommended actions.
(iii)Third  degree:  Jaiz  or  Mubah:  These  are
permissible  actions  as  to  which  religion  is
indifferent.
(iv)Fourth  degree:  Makruh:  That  which  is
reprobated as unworthy.
(v)Fifth degree: Haram: That which is forbidden.”
        Obviously, Triple Talaq does not fall within the first
degree, since even assuming that it forms part of the
Koran,  Hadis  or  Ijmaa,  it  is  not  something
“commanded”.   Equally  Talaq  itself  is  not  a
recommended action and, therefore, Triple Talaq will
not fall within the second degree.  Triple Talaq at best
falls within the third degree, but probably falls more
squarely  within  the  fourth  degree.   It  will  be
remembered that under the third degree, Triple Talaq is
a permissible action as to which religion is indifferent.
Within the fourth degree, it is reprobated as unworthy.
We  have  already  seen  that  though  permissible  in
Hanafi  jurisprudence,  yet,  that  very  jurisprudence
castigates  Triple  Talaq  as  being  sinful.   It  is  clear,
therefore,  that  Triple  Talaq  forms  no  part  of  Article
34225(1).  This being the case, the submission on behalf
of the Muslim Personal Board that the ball must be
bounced back to the legislature does not at all arise in
that  Article  25(2)(b)  would  only apply  if  a  particular
religious practice is first covered under Article 25(1) of
the Constitution.  
26.And  this  brings  us  to  the  question  as  to
when petitions have been filed under Article 32 of the
Constitution of India, is it permissible for us to state that
we will not decide an alleged breach of a fundamental
right, but will send the matter back to the legislature to
remedy such a wrong. 
27.In  Prem  Chand  Garg  v. Excise
Commissioner, U.P.,  1963 (Supp.) 1 SCR 885, this
Court held:
“2. Article 32(1) provides that the right to
move  the  Supreme  Court  by  appropriate
proceedings  for  the  enforcement  of  the
rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed,
and sub-art. (4) lays down that this right
shall  not  be  suspended  except  as
otherwise provided for by this Constitution.
There is no doubt that the right to move this
Court  conferred  on  the  citizens  of  this
country by Article 32 is itself a guaranteed
right and it holds the same place of pride in
the Constitution as do the other provisions
in  respect  of  the  citizens  fundamental
rights. The fundamental rights guaranteed
by  Part  III  which  have  been  made
343justiciable, form the most outstanding and
distinguishing  feature  of  the  Indian
Constitution. It is true that the said rights
are  not  absolute  and  they  have  to  be
adjusted in relation to the interests of the
general public. But the scheme of Article 19
illustrates, the difficult task of determining
the propriety or the validity of adjustments
made  either  legislatively  or  by  executive
action between the fundamental rights and
the  demands  of  socio-economic  welfare
has been ultimately left in charge  of  the
High Courts and the Supreme Court by the
Constitution. It is in the light of this position
that  the  Constitution  makers  thought  it
advisable to treat the citizen’s right to move
this  Court  for  the  enforcement  of  their
fundamental rights as being a fundamental
right  by  itself.  The  fundamental  right  to
move  this  Court  can,  therefore,  be
appropriately described as the corner-stone
of  the  democratic  edifice  raised  by  the
Constitution. That is why it is natural that
this Court should, in the words of Patanjali
Sastri J., regard itself “as the protector and
guarantor  of  fundamental  rights,”  and
should declare that “it cannot, consistently
with the responsibility laid upon it, refuse to
entertain  applications  seeking  protection
against  infringements  of  such  rights.”
(Vide Romesh  Thappar  v. State  of
Madras [[1950]  SCR  594  at  697]).  In
discharging the duties assigned to it, this
Court has to play the role “of a sentinel on
the qui vive” (Vide State of Madras  v. V.C.
Row [[1952] SCR 594 at 597]) and it must
always  regard  it  as  its  solemn  duty  to
protect  the  said  fundamental  rights’
zealously  and  vigilantly
(Vide Daryao v. State of U.P. [[1962] 1 SCR
574 at p. 582])”
28.We are heartened to note that in a recent
U.S. Supreme Court decision the same thing has been
344said with respect to knocking at the doors of the U.S.
Supreme Court in order to vindicate a basic right.  In
Obergefell  v. Hodges,  135  S.  Ct.  2584  at  2605,
decided on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court put
it thus:
“The dynamic of our constitutional system
is that individuals need not await legislative
action before asserting a fundamental right.
The  Nation’s  courts  are  open  to  injured
individuals who come to them to vindicate
their own direct, personal stake in our basic
charter.  An individual can invoke a right to
constitutional protection when he or she is
harmed,  even  if  the  broader  public
disagrees  and  even  if  the  legislature
refuses to act. The idea of the Constitution
“was to withdraw certain subjects from the
vicissitudes of political controversy, to place
them beyond the reach of majorities and
officials  and  to  establish  them  as  legal
principles  to  be  applied  by  the  courts.”
West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette , 319
U.S.  624,  638  (1943).   This  is  why
“fundamental rights may not be submitted
to a vote; they depend on the outcome of
no elections.”
29.However, counsel for the Muslim Personal
Board  relied  heavily  on  this  Court’s  decision  in
Ahmedabad Women Action Group  v. Union of India ,
(1997) 3 SCC 573.  This judgment refers to several
earlier decisions to hold that the declarations sought for
did  not  deserve  disposal  on  merits,  which  involve
issues of State policy that courts ordinarily do not have
345concern  with.   This  Court,  therefore,  declined  to
entertain writ petitions that asked for very sweeping
reliefs  which,  interestingly  enough,  included  a
declaration of voidness as to “unilateral talaq”.  This
Court referred in detail to the judgment of the Bombay
High  Court  in  Narasu  Appa  (supra)  in  declining  to
review Muslim personal law.  However, when it came to
the challenge of a statutory enactment, Muslim Women
(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, this Court
did not wish to multiply proceedings in that behalf, as a
challenge  was  pending  before  a  Constitution  Bench
regarding the same.
30.Hard as we tried, it is difficult to discover any
ratio in this  judgment,  as one part  of  the  judgment
contradicts  another  part.  If  one  particular  statutory
enactment  is  already  under  challenge,  there  is  no
reason why other similar enactments which were also
challenged should not have been disposed of by this
Court.  Quite apart from the above, it is a little difficult
to  appreciate  such  declination  in  the  light  of  Prem
Chand Garg (supra). This judgment, therefore, to the
extent that it is contrary to at least two Constitution
346Bench decisions cannot possibly be said to be good
law.
31.It is at this point that it is necessary to see
whether a fundamental right has been violated by the
1937 Act insofar as it seeks to enforce Triple Talaq as a
rule of law in the Courts in India.  
32.Article 14 of the Constitution of India is a
facet of equality of status and opportunity spoken of in
the Preamble to the Constitution.  The Article naturally
divides itself into two parts- (1) equality before the law,
and (2) the equal protection of the law.  Judgments of
this Court have referred to the fact that the equality
before law concept has been derived from the law in
the U.K., and the equal protection of the laws has been
borrowed from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution
of  the  United  States  of  America.   In  a  revealing
judgment, Subba Rao, J., dissenting, in State of U.P. v.
Deoman Upadhyaya , (1961) 1 SCR 14 at 34 further
went on to state that whereas equality before law is a
negative concept, the equal protection of the law has
positive content.  The early judgments of this Court
referred to the “discrimination” aspect of Article 14, and
evolved a rule by which subjects could be classified.  If
347the classification was “intelligible” having regard to the
object sought to be achieved, it would pass muster
under  Article 14’s anti-discrimination aspect.  Again,
Subba Rao, J., dissenting, in Lachhman Das v. State
of Punjab, (1963)  2 SCR  353 at  395, warned that
overemphasis on the doctrine of classification or an
anxious and sustained attempt to discover some basis
for  classification  may  gradually  and  imperceptibly
deprive the Article of its glorious content.   He referred
to the doctrine of classification as a “subsidiary rule”
evolved by courts to give practical content to the said
Article.  
33.In the pre-1974 era, the judgments of this
Court did refer to the “rule of law” or “positive” aspect of
Article 14, the concomitant of which is that if an action
is found to be arbitrary and, therefore, unreasonable, it
would negate the equal protection of the law contained
in Article 14 and would be struck down on this ground.
In S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India , (1967) 2 SCR
703, this Court held:
“In this context it is important to emphasize
that the absence of arbitrary power is the
first essential of the rule of law upon which
our whole constitutional system is based. In
a  system  governed  by  rule  of  law,
348discretion, when conferred upon executive
authorities, must be confined within clearly
defined  limits.  The  rule  of  law  from  this
point of view means that decisions should
be  made  by  the  application  of  known
principles and rules and, in general, such
decisions  should  be  predictable  and  the
citizen  should  know  where  he  is.  If  a
decision is taken without any principle or
without  any  rule  it  is  unpredictable  and
such  a  decision  is  the  antithesis  of  a
decision taken in accordance with the rule
of  law.  (See  Dicey  —  “Law  of  the
Constitution” — 10th Edn., Introduction cx).
“Law  has  reached  its  finest  moments”,
stated  Douglas,  J.  in  United
States v. Wunderlick [342 US 98], “when it
has freed man from the unlimited discretion
of  some  ruler….  Where  discretion,  is
absolute, man has always suffered”. It is in
this sense that the rule of law may be said
to  be  the  sworn  enemy  of  caprice.
Discretion, as Lord Mansfield  stated it in
classic  terms  in  the  case  of John
Wilkes [(1770)  4  Burr.  2528  at  2539],
“means sound discretion guided by law. It
must be governed by rule, not by humour :
it  must  not  be  arbitrary,  vague,  and
fanciful”.”  
                                     (pages 718 – 719)
This  was  in  the  context  of  service  rules  being
seniority  rules,  which  applied  to  the  Income  Tax
Department, being held to be violative of Article 14 of
the Constitution of India.  
34.Similarly, again in the context of an Article 14
challenge to service rules, this Court held in State of
349Mysore  v.  S.R.  Jayaram , (1968)  1  SCR  349  as
follows:
“The  principle  of  recruitment  by  open
competition  aims  at  ensuring  equality  of
opportunity in the matter of employment and
obtaining  the  services  of  the  most
meritorious candidates. Rules 1 to 8, 9(1)
and  the  first  part  of  Rule  9(2)  seek  to
achieve this aim. The last part of Rule 9(2)
subverts and destroys the basic objectives
of  the  preceding  rules.  It  vests  in  the
Government  an  arbitrary  power  of
patronage. Though Rule 9(1) requires the
appointment  of  successful  candidates  to
Class  I  posts  in  the  order  of  merit  and
thereafter to Class II posts in the order of
merit, Rule 9(1) is subject to Rule 9(2), and
under  the  cover  of  Rule  9(2)  the
Government can even arrogate to itself the
power of assigning a Class I post to a less
meritorious and a Class II post to a more
meritorious  candidate.  We  hold  that  the
latter  part  of  Rule  9(2)  gives  the
Government an arbitrary power of ignoring
the just claims of successful candidates for
recruitment to offices under the State. It is
violative  of  Articles  14  and  16(1)  of  the
Constitution and must be struck down.”
                                      (pages 353 – 354)
35.In  the  celebrated  Indira  Gandhi  v. Raj
Narain judgment, reported in 1975 Supp SCC 1 , Article
329-A sub-clauses (4) and (5) were struck down by a
Constitution Bench of this Court. Applying the newly
evolved  basic  structure  doctrine  laid  down  in
Kesavananda Bharati  v.  State of Kerala , (1973) 4
350SCC 225, Ray, C.J. struck down the said amendment
thus:
“59.  Clause  (4)  suffers  from  these
infirmities.  First,  the  forum  might  be
changed  but  another  forum  has  to  be
created. If the constituent power became
itself the forum to decide the disputes the
constituent power by repealing the law in
relation  to  election  petitions  and  matters
connected  therewith  did  not  have  any
petition  to  seize  upon  to  deal  with  the
same.  Secondly,  any  decision  is  to  be
made in accordance with law. Parliament
has  power  to  create  law  and  apply  the
same. In the present case, the constituent
power did not have any law to apply to the
case,  because  the  previous  law  did  not
apply  and  no  other  law  was  applied  by
clause (4). The validation of the election in
the  present  case  is,  therefore,  not  by
applying any law and it, therefore, offends
rule of law.” 
(at page 44)
36.This passage is of great significance in that
the  amendment  was  said  to  be  bad  because  the
constituent power did not have any law to apply to the
case, and this being so, the rule of law contained in the
Constitution would be violated.  This rule of law has an
obvious reference to Article 14 of the Constitution, in
that it would be wholly arbitrary to decide the case
without applying any law, and would thus violate the
rule of law contained in the said Article. Chandrachud,
J.,  was  a  little  more  explicit  in  that  he  expressly
351referred to Article 14 and stated that Article 329-A is an
outright negation of the right of equality conferred by
Article 14.  This was the case because the law would
be discriminatory in that certain high personages would
be put above the law in the absence of a differentia
reasonably related to the object of the law.  He went on
to add:   
“681.  It follows that clauses (4) and (5) of
Article  329-A  are  arbitrary  and  are
calculated to damage or destroy the rule of
law.  Imperfections  of  language  hinder  a
precise definition of the rule of law as of the
definition  of  ‘law’  itself.  And  the
Constitutional law of 1975 has undergone
many changes since A.V. Dicey, the great
expounder of the rule of law, delivered his
lectures  as  Vinerian  Professor of English
law  at  Oxford,  which  were  published  in
1885  under  the  title,  “Introduction  to  the
Study of the Law of the Constitution ”. But
so  much,  I  suppose,  can  be  said  with
reasonable  certainty  that  the  rule  of  law
means  that  the  exercise  of  powers  of
Government  shall  be  conditioned  by  law
and that subject to the exceptions to the
doctrine  of  equality,  no  one  shall  be
exposed  to  the  arbitrary  will  of  the
Government. Dicey gave three meanings to
rule  of  law:  Absence  of  arbitrary  power,
equality  before  the  law  or  the  equal
subjection of all classes to the ordinary law
of  the  land  administered by ordinary law
courts and that the Constitution is not the
source but the consequence of the rights of
individuals, as defined and enforced by the
courts. The second meaning grew out of
Dicey’s unsound dislike of the French Droit
Administratif  which  he  regarded  “as  a
352misfortune inflicted upon the benighted folk
across the Channel” [See S.A. de Smith:
Judicial  Review  of  Administrative  Action,
(1968)  p.  5].  Indeed,  so  great  was  his
influence on the thought of the day that as
recently as in 1935 Lord Hewart, the Lord
Chief  Justice  of  England,  dismissed  the
term  “administrative  law”  as  “continental
jargon”.  The  third  meaning  is  hardly
apposite  in  the  context  of  our  written
Constitution for, in India, the Constitution is
the source of all rights and obligations. We
may not  therefore  rely wholly on  Dicey’s
exposition of the rule of law but ever since
the second world war, the rule has come to
acquire a positive content in all democratic
countries.  [See  Wade  and  Phillips:
Constitutional Law (Sixth Edn., pp. 70-73)]
The  International  Commission  of  Jurists,
which has a consultative status under the
United Nations, held its Congress in Delhi
in  1959  where  lawyers,  judges  and  law
teachers  representing  fifty-three  countries
affirmed that the rule of law is a dynamic
concept  which  should  be  employed  to
safeguard  and  advance  the  political  and
civil rights of the individual in a free society.
One of  the  committees  of that  Congress
emphasised that no law should subject any
individual  to  discriminatory  treatment.
These principles must vary from country to
country depending upon the provisions of
its Constitution and indeed upon whether
there exists a written Constitution. As it has
been  said  in  a  lighter  vein,  to  show  the
supremacy of the Parliament, the charm of
the English Constitution is that “it does not
exist”.  Our  Constitution  exists  and  must
continue  to  exist.  It  guarantees  equality
before law and the equal protection of laws
to everyone. The denial of such equality, as
modified by the judicially evolved theory of
classification, is the very negation of rule of
law.”   
                                                          (at page 258)
35337.This paragraph is an early application of the
doctrine of arbitrariness which follows from the rule of
law contained in Article 14.  It is of some significance
that Dicey’s formulation of the rule of law was referred
to, which contains both absence of arbitrary power and
equality before the law, as being of the essence of the
rule of law.  
38.We now come  to  the  development  of  the
doctrine  of  arbitrariness  and  its  application  to  State
action as a distinct doctrine on which State action may
be struck down as being violative of the rule of law
contained  in  Article  14.   In  a  significant  passage
Bhagwati, J., in E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N., (1974)
4 SCC 3 stated (at page 38):
“85. The last two grounds of challenge may
be  taken  up  together  for  consideration.
Though  we  have  formulated  the  third
ground  of  challenge  as  a  distinct  and
separate ground, it is really in substance
and effect merely an aspect of the second
ground  based  on  violation  of  Articles  14
and  16.  Article  16  embodies  the
fundamental guarantee that there shall be
equality  of  opportunity  for  all  citizens  in
matters  relating  to  employment  or
appointment to any office under the State.
Though  enacted  as  a  distinct  and
independent fundamental right because of
its great importance as a principle ensuring
equality  of  opportunity  in  public
354employment which is so vital to the building
up of the new classless egalitarian society
envisaged in the Constitution, Article 16 is
only an instance of the application of the
concept of equality enshrined in Article 14.
In other words, Article 14 is the genus while
Article  16  is  a  species.  Article  16  gives
effect  to  the  doctrine  of  equality  in  all
matters relating to public employment. The
basic  principle  which,  therefore,  informs
both  Articles  14  and  16  is  equality  and
inhibition against discrimination. Now, what
is  the  content  and  reach  of  this  great
equalising principle? It is a founding faith,
to use the words of Bose. J., “a way of life”,
and it must not be subjected to a narrow
pedantic  or  lexicographic  approach.  We
cannot  countenance  any  attempt  to
truncate  its  all-embracing  scope  and
meaning, for to do so would be to violate its
activist  magnitude.  Equality is  a dynamic
concept with many aspects and dimensions
and  it  cannot  be  “cribbed,  cabined  and
confined” within traditional and doctrinaire
limits.  From  a  positivistic  point  of  view,
equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact
equality  and  arbitrariness  are  sworn
enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a
republic while the other, to the whim and
caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an
act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is
unequal  both  according  to  political  logic
and  constitutional  law  and  is  therefore
violative of Article 14 , and if it effects any
matter relating to public employment, it is
also violative of Article 16. Articles 14 and
16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and
ensure fairness and equality of treatment.
They  require  that  State  action  must  be
based  on  valid  relevant  principles
applicable alike to all similarly situate and it
must not be guided by any extraneous or
irrelevant  considerations  because  that
would  be  denial  of  equality.  Where  the
operative  reason  for  State  action,  as
355distinguished from motive inducing from the
antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate
and relevant but is extraneous and outside
the  area  of  permissible  considerations,  it
would  amount  to  mala  fide  exercise  of
power and that is hit by Articles 14 and 16.
Mala  fide  exercise  of  power  and
arbitrariness are different lethal radiations
emanating from the same vice: in fact the
latter  comprehends  the  former.  Both  are
inhibited by Articles 14 and 16.” 
[Emphasis Supplied]
39.This  was  further  fleshed  out  in  Maneka
Gandhi v. Union of India , (1978) 1 SCC 248, where,
after stating that various fundamental rights must be
read together and must overlap and fertilize each other,
Bhagwati, J., further amplified this doctrine as follows
(at pages 283-284): 
“The  nature  and  requirement  of  the
procedure under Article 21
7. Now, the question immediately arises as
to  what  is  the  requirement  of  Article  14:
what is the content and reach of the great
equalising  principle  enunciated  in  this
article? There can be no doubt that it is a
founding  faith  of  the  Constitution.  It  is
indeed the pillar on which  rests securely
the foundation of our democratic republic.
And, therefore, it must not be subjected to
a  narrow,  pedantic  or  lexicographic
approach. No attempt should be made to
truncate  its  all-embracing  scope  and
meaning, for to do so would be to violate its
activist  magnitude.  Equality is  a dynamic
concept with many aspects and dimensions
and  it  cannot  be  imprisoned  within
traditional and doctrinaire limits. We must
356reiterate here what was pointed out by the
majority in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil
Nadu [(1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC (L&S)
165 : (1974) 2 SCR 348] namely, that “from
a  positivistic  point  of  view,  equality  is
antithetic  to  arbitrariness.  In  fact  equality
and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one
belongs  to  the  rule  of  law in  a  republic,
while the other, to the whim and caprice of
an  absolute  monarch.  Where  an  act  is
arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal
both  according  to  political  logic  and
constitutional law and is therefore violative
of  Article  14”.  Article  14  strikes  at
arbitrariness  in  State  action  and  ensures
fairness  and  equality  of  treatment.  The
principle of reasonableness, which legally
as well as philosophically, is an essential
element  of  equality  or  non-arbitrariness
pervades  Article  14  like  a  brooding
omnipresence  and  the  procedure
contemplated by Article 21 must answer the
test  of  reasonableness  in  order  to  be  in
conformity with Article 14.  It must be “right
and just and fair” and not arbitrary, fanciful
or  oppressive;  otherwise,  it  would  be  no
procedure  at  all  and  the  requirement  of
Article 21 would not be satisfied.” 
[Emphasis Supplied]
 40.This  was  further  clarified  in  A.L.  Kalra  v.
Project and Equipment Corpn. , (1984) 3 SCC 316,
following  Royappa (supra)  and  holding  that
arbitrariness is a doctrine distinct from discrimination. It
was held:
“19…  It  thus  appears  well-settled  that
Article  14  strikes  at  arbitrariness  in
executive/administrative  action  because
any action that is arbitrary must necessarily
involve the negation of equality. One need
357not  confine  the  denial  of  equality  to  a
comparative  evaluation  between  two
persons  to  arrive  at  a  conclusion  of
discriminatory treatment. An action per se
arbitrary  itself  denies  equal  of  ( sic)
protection by law. The Constitution Bench
pertinently  observed  in  Ajay  Hasia
case [(1981) 1 SCC 722: 1981 SCC (L&S)
258: AIR 1981 SC 487: (1981) 2 SCR 79:
(1981)  1  LLJ  103]  and  put  the  matter
beyond controversy when it said “wherever
therefore,  there  is  arbitrariness  in  State
action whether it be of the Legislature or of
the  executive  or  of  an  ‘authority’  under
Article  12,  Article  14  immediately springs
into  action  and  strikes  down  such  State
action”.  This  view was  further  elaborated
and  affirmed  in  D.S.  Nakara v. Union  of
India [(1983) 1 SCC 305: 1983 SCC (L&S)
145: AIR 1983 SC 130: (1983) UPSC 263].
In Maneka Gandhi  v. Union of India [(1978)
1 SCC 248: AIR 1978 SC 597: (1978) 2
SCR 621] it was observed that Article 14
strikes at arbitrariness in State action and
ensures fairness and equality of treatment.
It is thus too late in the day to contend that
an executive action shown to be arbitrary is
not either judicially reviewable or within the
reach  of  Article  14. ”  
                                               (at page 328)
The  same  view was  reiterated in  Babita  Prasad  v.
State of Bihar , (1993) Suppl. 3 SCC 268 at 285, at
paragraph 31.
41.That the arbitrariness doctrine contained in
Article  14  would  apply  to  negate  legislation,
subordinate  legislation  and  executive  action  is  clear
from a celebrated passage in the case of Ajay Hasia v.
358Khalid Mujib Sehravardi , (1981) 1 SCC 722 (at pages
740-741):
“16... The true scope and ambit of Article 14
has been the subject-matter of numerous
decisions and it is not necessary to make
any  detailed  reference  to  them.  It  is
sufficient  to  state  that  the  content  and
reach of Article 14 must not be confused
with  the  doctrine  of  classification.
Unfortunately, in  the  early  stages  of  the
evolution of our constitutional law, Article 14
came to be identified with the doctrine of
classification because the view taken was
that that article forbids discrimination and
there would be no discrimination where the
classification  making  the  differentia  fulfils
two  conditions,  namely,  ( i)  that  the
classification is founded on an intelligible
differentia  which  distinguishes  persons  or
things  that  are  grouped  together  from
others left out of the group; and ( ii) that that
differentia  has  a  rational  relation  to  the
object  sought  to  be  achieved  by  the
impugned legislative or executive action. It
was  for  the  first  time  in  E.P.
Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu  [(1974) 4
SCC  3,  38:  1974  SCC  (L&S)  165,  200:
(1974) 2 SCR 348] that this Court laid bare
a new dimension of Article 14 and pointed
out  that  that  article  has  highly  activist
magnitude  and  it  embodies  a  guarantee
against arbitrariness. This Court speaking
through one of us (Bhagwati, J.) said: [SCC
p. 38: SCC (L&S) p. 200, para 85]
“The  basic  principle  which,
therefore, informs both Articles
14  and  16  is  equality  and
inhibition against discrimination.
Now, what  is  the  content  and
reach  of  this  great  equalising
principle? It is a founding faith,
to use the words of Bose, J., “a
359way of life”, and it must not be
subjected to a narrow pedantic
or lexicographic approach. We
cannot  countenance  any
attempt  to  truncate  its
all-embracing  scope  and
meaning, for to do so would be
to violate its activist magnitude.
Equality is a dynamic concept
with  many  aspects  and
dimensions  and  it  cannot  be
“cribbed, cabined and confined”
within traditional and doctrinaire
limits. From a positivistic point
of view, equality is antithetic to
arbitrariness.  In  fact,  equality
and  arbitrariness  are  sworn
enemies;  one  belongs  to  the
rule of law in a republic while
the  other,  to  the  whim  and
caprice of an absolute monarch.
Where an act is arbitrary it is
implicit  in  it  that  it  is  unequal
both according to political logic
and  constitutional  law  and  is
therefore violative of Article 14,
and  if  it  affects  any  matter
relating to public employment, it
is  also  violative  of  Article  16.
Articles  14  and  16  strike  at
arbitrariness in State action and
ensure fairness and equality of
treatment.”
This vital and dynamic aspect which was till
then lying latent and submerged in the few
simple but pregnant words of Article 14 was
explored and brought to light in  Royappa
case [(1975) 1 SCC 485: 1975 SCC (L&S)
99:  (1975)  3  SCR  616]  and  it  was
reaffirmed  and  elaborated  by  this  Court
in Maneka Gandhi  v. Union of India [(1978)
1  SCC  248]  where  this  Court  again
speaking through one of us (Bhagwati, J.)
observed: (SCC pp. 283-84, para 7)
360“Now the question immediately
arises  as  to  what  is  the
requirement of Article 14: What
is the content and reach of the
great  equalising  principle
enunciated in this Article? There
can  be  no  doubt  that  it  is  a
founding  faith  of  the
Constitution.  It  is  indeed  the
pillar  on  which  rests  securely
the  foundation  of  our
democratic  republic.  And,
therefore,  it  must  not  be
subjected to a narrow, pedantic
or  lexicographic  approach.  No
attempt  should  be  made  to
truncate its all-embracing scope
and meaning, for to do so would
be  to  violate  its  activist
magnitude.  Equality  is  a
dynamic  concept  with  many
aspects and dimensions and it
cannot  be  imprisoned  within
traditional  and  doctrinaire
limits....  Article  14  strikes  at
arbitrariness in State action and
ensures fairness and equality of
treatment.  The  principle  of
reasonableness,  which  legally
as well as philosophically, is an
essential element of equality or
non-arbitrariness  pervades
Article  14  like  a  brooding
omnipresence.”
This  was  again  reiterated  by  this  Court
in International  Airport  Authority
case [(1979) 3 SCC 489 ] at p. 1042 (SCC
p. 511) of the Report. It must therefore now
be taken to be well settled that what Article
14  strikes  at  is  arbitrariness  because  an
action  that  is  arbitrary,  must  necessarily
involve negation of equality. The doctrine of
classification which is evolved by the courts
is not paraphrase of Article 14 nor is it the
objective and end of that article. It is merely
361a judicial formula for determining whether
the  legislative  or  executive  action  in
question  is  arbitrary  and  therefore
constituting  denial  of  equality.  If  the
classification  is  not  reasonable  and  does
not satisfy the  two  conditions referred  to
above,  the  impugned  legislative  or
executive action would plainly be arbitrary
and the guarantee of equality under Article
14 would be breached. Wherever therefore
there  is  arbitrariness  in  State  action
whether it be of the legislature or of the
executive or of an ‘authority’ under Article
12,  Article  14  immediately  springs  into
action and strikes down such State action.
In fact, the concept of reasonableness and
non-arbitrariness  pervades  the  entire
constitutional  scheme  and  is  a  golden
thread which runs through the whole of the
fabric of the Constitution .” 
 [Emphasis Supplied]
42.In this view of the law, a three Judge Bench
of this Court in  K.R. Lakshmanan (Dr.)  v. State of
T.N., (1996) 2 SCC 226 ,  struck down a 1986 Tamil
Nadu  Act  on  the  ground  that  it  was  arbitrary  and,
therefore,  violative  of  Article  14.    Two  separate
arguments were addressed under Article 14. One was
that  the  Act  in  question  was  discriminatory  and,
therefore, violative of Article 14.  The other was that in
any case the  Act  was  arbitrary and for  that  reason
would also violate a separate facet of Article 14.  This
is clear from paragraph 45 of the said judgment.   The
judgment went on to accept both these arguments.  In
362so far as the discrimination aspect is concerned, this
Court struck down the 1986 Act on the ground that it
was  discriminatory  in  paragraphs  46  and  47.
Paragraphs 48 to 50 are important, in that this Court
struck  down  the  1986  Act  for  being  arbitrary,
separately, as follows (at pages 256-257):
“48.  We  see  considerable  force  in  the
contention  of  Mr.  Parasaran  that  the
acquisition and transfer of the undertaking
of the Club is arbitrary. The two Acts were
amended by the 1949 Act and the definition
of ‘gaming’ was amended. The object of the
amendment was to include horse-racing in
the definition of ‘gaming’. The provisions of
the 1949 Act were, however, not enforced
till the 1974 Act was enacted and enforced
with effect from 31-3-1975. The 1974 Act
was enacted with a view to provide for the
abolition  of  wagering  or  betting  on
horse-races in the State of Tamil Nadu. It is
thus obvious that the consistent policy of
the  State  Government,  as  projected
through  various  legislations  from  1949
onwards, has been to declare horse-racing
as gambling and as such prohibited under
the two Acts. The operation of the 1974 Act
was  stayed  by  this  Court  and  as  a
consequence  the  horse-races  are
continuing under the orders of this Court.
The  policy  of  the  State  Government  as
projected  in  all  the  enactments  on  the
subject prior to 1986 shows that the State
Government  considered  horse-racing  as
gambling and as such prohibited under the
law.  The  1986  Act  on  the  other  hand
declares horse-racing as a public purpose
and in the interest of the general public.
There is apparent contradiction in the two
stands.  We  do  not  agree  with  the
363contention of Mr. Parasaran that the 1986
Act is a colourable piece of legislation, but
at the same time we are of the view that no
public  purpose  is  being  served  by
acquisition and transfer of the undertaking
of the Club by the Government. We fail to
understand how the State Government can
acquire and take over the functioning of the
race-club when it has already enacted the
1974  Act  with  the  avowed  object  of
declaring  horse-racing  as  gambling?
Having enacted a law to abolish betting on
horse-racing  and  stoutly  defending  the
same  before  this  Court  in  the  name  of
public  good  and  public  morality, it  is  not
open to the State Government to acquire
the undertaking of horse-racing again in the
name of public good and public purpose. It
is ex facie irrational to invoke “public good
and  public  purpose”  for  declaring
horse-racing  as  gambling  and  as  such
prohibited under law, and at the same time
speak of “public purpose and public good”
for acquiring the race-club and conducting
the horse-racing by the Government itself.
Arbitrariness is writ large on the face of the
provisions of the 1986 Act .
49. We, therefore, hold that the provisions
of 1986 Act are discriminatory and arbitrary
and as such violate and infract the right to
equality enshrined under Article 14 of the
Constitution.
50. Since we have struck down the 1986
Act on the ground that it violates Article 14
of the Constitution, it is not necessary for
us to go into the question of its validity on
the ground of Article 19 of the Constitution.”
 
    [Emphasis Supplied]
43.Close  upon  the  heels  of  this  judgment,  a
discordant  note  was  struck  in  State  of  A.P.  v.
364McDowell & Co. , (1996) 3 SCC 709.  Another three
Judge Bench, in repelling an argument based on the
arbitrariness facet of Article 14, held:
“43. Shri Rohinton Nariman submitted that
inasmuch  as  a  large  number  of  persons
falling within the exempted categories are
allowed to consume intoxicating liquors in
the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  the  total
prohibition of manufacture and production
of  these  liquors  is  ‘arbitrary’  and  the
amending Act is liable to be struck down on
this  ground  alone.  Support  for  this
proposition is sought from a judgment of
this  Court  in  State  of  T.N.  v. Ananthi
Ammal [(1995)  1  SCC  519].  Before,
however, we refer to the holding in the said
decision, it would be appropriate to remind
ourselves of certain basic propositions in
this  behalf.  In  the  United  Kingdom,
Parliament  is  supreme.  There  are  no
limitations upon the power of Parliament.
No court in the United Kingdom can strike
down an Act made by Parliament on any
ground. As against this, the United States
of  America  has  a  Federal  Constitution
where the power of the Congress and the
State Legislatures to make laws is limited in
two  ways,  viz.,  the  division  of  legislative
powers between the States and the Federal
Government  and  the  fundamental  rights
(Bill  of  Rights)  incorporated  in  the
Constitution. In India, the position is similar
to the United States of America. The power
of Parliament or for that matter, the State
Legislatures is restricted in two ways. A law
made by Parliament or the legislature can
be struck down by courts on two grounds
and  two  grounds  alone,  viz.,  (1)  lack  of
legislative competence and (2) violation of
any of the fundamental rights guaranteed in
Part III of the Constitution or of any other
constitutional  provision.  There  is  no  third
365ground.  We do  not  wish  to  enter  into  a
discussion  of  the  concepts  of  procedural
unreasonableness  and  substantive
unreasonableness — concepts inspired by
the  decisions  of  United  States  Supreme
Court. Even in U.S.A., these concepts and
in particular the concept of substantive due
process  have  proved  to  be  of  unending
controversy,  the  latest  thinking  tending
towards a severe curtailment of this ground
(substantive  due  process).  The  main
criticism against the ground of substantive
due process being that it seeks to set up
the courts as arbiters of the wisdom of the
legislature in enacting the particular piece
of legislation. It is enough for us to say that
by whatever name it is characterised, the
ground of invalidation must fall within the
four corners of the two grounds mentioned
above. In other words, say, if an enactment
is challenged as violative of Article 14, it
can be struck down only if it is found that it
is  violative  of  the  equality  clause/equal
protection  clause  enshrined  therein.
Similarly, if an enactment is challenged as
violative of any of the fundamental rights
guaranteed by clauses ( a) to (g) of Article
19(1), it can be struck down only if it is
found not saved by any of the clauses (2)
to (6) of Article 19 and so on. No enactment
can be struck down by just saying that it is
arbitrary or unreasonable. Some or other
constitutional  infirmity  has  to  be  found
before  invalidating  an  Act.  An  enactment
cannot be struck down on the ground that
court  thinks  it  unjustified.  Parliament  and
the legislatures, composed as they are of
the  representatives  of  the  people,  are
supposed  to  know  and  be  aware  of  the
needs of the people and what is good and
bad  for  them.  The  court  cannot  sit  in
judgment  over  their  wisdom.  In  this
connection, it should be remembered that
even in the case of administrative action,
the  scope  of  judicial  review  is  limited  to
366three grounds, viz., ( i) unreasonableness,
which  can  more  appropriately  be  called
irrationality, (ii) illegality and ( iii) procedural
impropriety  (see  Council  of  Civil  Service
Unions v. Minister  for  Civil  Service  [1985
AC 374: (1984) 3 All ER 935: (1984) 3 WLR
1174] which decision has been accepted by
this  Court  as  well).  The  applicability  of
doctrine  of  proportionality  even  in
administrative  law  sphere  is  yet  a
debatable issue. (See the opinions of Lords
Lowry and Ackner in  R. v. Secy. of State for
Home  Deptt.,  ex  p  Brind  [1991  AC  696:
(1991)  1  All  ER  720]  AC  at  766-67  and
762.) It would be rather odd if an enactment
were  to  be  struck  down  by applying  the
said principle when its applicability even in
administrative law sphere is not fully and
finally settled. It is one thing to say that a
restriction  imposed  upon  a  fundamental
right  can  be  struck  down  if  it  is
disproportionate,  excessive  or
unreasonable  and  quite  another  thing  to
say  that  the  court  can  strike  down
enactment  if  it  thinks  it  unreasonable,
unnecessary or unwarranted. ” 
(at pages 737-739)
44.This judgment failed to notice at least two
binding precedents, first, the judgment of a Constitution
Bench in Ajay Hasia (supra) and second, the judgment
of  a  coordinate  three  judge  bench  in  Lakshmanan
(supra).  Apart from this, the reasoning contained as to
why  arbitrariness  cannot  be  used  to  strike  down
legislation as opposed to both executive action and
subordinate legislation was as follows:
367(1)According  to  the  Bench  in  McDowell
(supra),  substantive  due  process  is  not  something
accepted by either the American courts or our courts
and, therefore, this being a reiteration of substantive
due  process  being  read  into  Article  14  cannot  be
applied.   A  Constitution  Bench  in  Mohd.  Arif  v.
Supreme Court of India , (2014) 9 SCC 737, has held,
following the celebrated  Maneka Gandhi  (supra), as
follows:
“27.  The  stage  was  now  set  for  the
judgment  in  Maneka  Gandhi  [Maneka
Gandhi v. Union  of  India ,  (1978)  2  SCR
621:  (1978)  1  SCC  248].  Several
judgments were delivered, and the upshot
of all of them was that Article 21 was to be
read along with other fundamental rights,
and so  read not only has the procedure
established  by  law  to  be  just,  fair  and
reasonable, but also the law itself has to be
reasonable as Articles 14 and 19 have now
to be read into Article 21. [See at SCR pp.
646-48:  SCC  pp.  393-95,  paras  198-204
per Beg, C.J., at SCR pp. 669, 671-74 &
687: SCC pp. 279-84 & 296-97, paras 5-7
&  18  per  Bhagwati,  J.  and  at  SCR  pp.
720-23 : SCC pp. 335-39, paras 74-85 per
Krishna Iyer, J.]. Krishna Iyer, J. set out the
new doctrine with remarkable clarity thus:
(SCR p. 723: SCC pp. 338-39, para 85)
“85. To sum up, ‘procedure’ in
Article 21 means fair, not formal
procedure. ‘Law’ is reasonable
law, not any enacted piece. As
Article 22 specifically spells out
the  procedural  safeguards  for
368preventive  and  punitive
detention,  a  law  providing  for
such detentions should conform
to Article 22. It has been rightly
pointed out that for other rights
forming part of personal liberty,
the  procedural  safeguards
enshrined  in  Article  21  are
available.  Otherwise,  as  the
procedural  safeguards
contained  in  Article  22 will  be
available  only  in  cases  of
preventive  and  punitive
detention, the right to life, more
fundamental  than  any  other
forming part of personal liberty
and  paramount  to  the
happiness, dignity and worth of
the  individual,  will  not  be
entitled  to  any  procedural
safeguard  save  such  as  a
legislature’s mood chooses.”
28. Close on the heels of  Maneka Gandhi
case [Maneka  Gandhi  v. Union  of  India ,
(1978)  2  SCR  621:  (1978)  1  SCC  248]
came Mithu v. State  of  Punjab  [(1983)  2
SCC 277: 1983 SCC (Cri) 405], in which
case the Court noted as follows: (SCC pp.
283-84, para 6)
“6.  …  In Sunil  Batra v. Delhi
Admn. [(1978)  4  SCC  494:
1979  SCC  (Cri)  155],  while
dealing with the question as to
whether  a  person  awaiting
death sentence can be kept in
solitary  confinement,  Krishna
Iyer  J.  said  that  though  our
Constitution did not have a “due
process”  clause  as  in  the
American  Constitution;  the
same  consequence  ensued
after  the  decisions  in  Bank
Nationalisation  case  [Rustom
Cavasjee  Cooper  (Banks
369Nationalisation)  v. Union  of
India,  (1970)  1  SCC  248]
and Maneka  Gandhi
case [Maneka  Gandhi  v. Union
of  India,  (1978)  2  SCR  621:
(1978) 1 SCC 248] .…
In Bachan  Singh  [Bachan
Singh v. State of Punjab , (1980)
2  SCC  684:  1980  SCC  (Cri)
580]  which  upheld  the
constitutional  validity  of  the
death  penalty,  Sarkaria  J.,
speaking for the majority, said
that if Article 21 is understood in
accordance  with  the
interpretation  put  upon  it
in Maneka  Gandhi  [Maneka
Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978)
2  SCR  621  :  (1978)  1  SCC
248],  it  will  read  to  say  that:
(SCC p. 730, para 136)
‘136.  “No  person  shall  be
deprived of his life or personal
liberty except according to fair,
just and reasonable procedure
established by valid law.”  
The  wheel  has  turned  full  circle.
Substantive  due  process  is  now  to  be
applied to the fundamental right to life and
liberty.” 
                        (at pages 755-756)
   Clearly, therefore, the three Judge Bench has not
noticed  Maneka Gandhi  (supra) cited in  Mohd. Arif
(supra) to show that the wheel has turned full circle and
substantive due process is part of Article 21 as it is to
be read with Articles 14 and 19. 
370Mathew, J., while delivering the first Tej Bahadur
Sapru  Memorial  Lecture  entitled  “ Democracy  and
Judicial Review ”, has pointed out:
“Still another point and I am done.  The
constitutional makers have formally refused
to incorporate the “due process clause” in
our Constitution on the basis, it seems, of
the advice tendered by Justice Frankfurter
to Shri B.N. Rau thinking that it will make
the Court a third Chamber and widen the
area of Judicial review.  But unwittingly, I
should think, they have imported the most
vital and active element of the concept by
their  theory  of  review  of  ‘reasonable
restrictions’ which might be imposed by law
on many of the fundamental rights.  Taken
in  its  modern  expanded  sense,  the
American “due process clause” stands as a
high level guarantee of ‘reasonableness’ in
relation  between  man  and  state,  an
injunction  against  arbitrariness  or
oppressiveness.   I have had occasion to
consider  this  question  in  Kesavananda
Bharati’s case.  I said:
“When a court adjudges that a
legislation is bad on the ground
that  it  is  an  unreasonable
restriction,  it  is  drawing  the
elusive  ingredients  for  its
conclusion  from  several
sources…If  you  examine  the
cases relating to the imposition
of reasonable restrictions by a
law, it will be found that all of
them  adopt  a  standard  which
the  American  Supreme  Court
has  adopted  in  adjudging
reasonableness of a legislation
under the due process clause.”
371In fact, Mithu v. State of Punjab , (1983) 2 SCC 277,
followed a Constitution Bench judgment in Sunil Batra
v. Delhi Administration & Ors. , (1978) 4 SCC 494. In
that  case,  Section  30(2)  of  the  Prisons  Act  was
challenged as being unconstitutional, because every
prisoner under sentence of death shall be confined in a
cell apart from all other prisoners, that is to say he will
be  placed  under  solitary  confinement.    The
Constitution Bench read down Section 30(2) to refer
only to a person who  is sentenced to death finally,
which  would  include  petitions  for  mercy  to  the
Governor and/or to the President which have not yet
been disposed of.  In so holding, Desai, J. speaking for
four learned Judges, held (at pages 574-575):
“228. The challenge under  Article 21 must
fail on our interpretation of sub-section (2)
of  Section  30.  Personal  liberty  of  the
person who is incarcerated is to a great
extent curtailed by punitive detention. It is
even curtailed in preventive detention. The
liberty  to  move,  mix,  mingle,  talk,  share
company with co-prisoners, if substantially
curtailed, would be violative of Article 21
unless the curtailment has the backing of
law.  Sub-section  (2)  of  Section  30
establishes the procedure by which it can
be curtailed but it must be read subject to
our  interpretation.  The  word  “law”  in  the
expression “procedure established by law”
in Article 21 has been interpreted to mean
in  Maneka Gandhi’s case  (supra) that the
372law must  be  right, just  and  fair, and not
arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. Otherwise
it  would  be  no  procedure  at  all  and  the
requirement  of  Article  21  would  not  be
satisfied.  If  it  is  arbitrary  it  would  be
violative of Article 14 . Once Section 30(2)  is
read down in the manner in which we have
done, its obnoxious element is erased and
it cannot be said that it is arbitrary  or that
there  is  deprivation  of  personal  liberty
without the authority of law.” 
                                   [Emphasis Supplied]
In a long and illuminating concurring judgment, Krishna
Iyer, J., added (at page 518):
“52.  True,  our  Constitution  has  no  ‘due
process’ clause or the VIII Amendment; but,
in this branch of law, after  R.C. Cooper v.
Union  of  India ,  (1970)  1  SCC  248  and
Maneka Gandhi  v. Union of India, (1978) 1
SCC 248, the consequence is the same.
For  what  is  punitively  outrageous,
scandalizingly  unusual  or  cruel  and
rehabilitatively  counter-productive,  is
unarguably unreasonable and arbitrary and
is shot down by Articles 14 and 19  and if
inflicted  with  procedural  unfairness,  falls
foul of Article 21.”
 
                                 [Emphasis Supplied]
Coming to Mithu (supra), a Constitution Bench of this
Court  struck  down  Section  303  of  the  Indian  Penal
Code, by which a mandatory sentence of death was
imposed on life convicts who commit murder in jail.
The argument made by the learned counsel on behalf
of the petitioner was set out thus:
373“5. But before we proceed to point out the
infirmities  from  which  Section  303 suffers,
we  must  indicate  the  nature  of  the
argument  which  has  been  advanced  on
behalf of the petitioners in order to assail
the validity of that section. The sum and
substance  of  the  argument  is  that  the
provision contained in Section 303  is wholly
unreasonable and arbitrary and thereby, it
violates Article 21  of the Constitution which
affords the guarantee that no person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty
except  in  accordance  with  the  procedure
established by law. Since the procedure by
which Section  303  authorises  the
deprivation of life is unfair and unjust, the
Section  is  unconstitutional.  Having
examined  this  argument  with  care  and
concern, we are of the opinion that it must
be accepted and  Section 303 of the Penal
Code struck down. ” 
(at page 283)
After quoting from Sunil Batra (supra), the question
before the Court was set out thus:
“6……The  question  which  then  arises
before us is whether the sentence of death,
prescribed  by  Section  303  of  the  Penal
Code for the offence of murder committed
by a person who is under a sentence of life
imprisonment, is arbitrary and oppressive
so  as  to  be  violative  of  the  fundamental
right conferred by Article 21.”
(at page 285)
After  setting  out  the  question  thus,  the  Court
further stated:
“9…...Is  a  law  which  provides  for  the
sentence  of  death  for  the  offence  of
murder, without affording to the accused an
opportunity  to  show  cause  why  that
374sentence should not be imposed, just and
fair?  Secondly, is such a law just and fair if,
in  the  very nature  of  things,  it  does  not
require the court to state the reasons why
the supreme penalty of law is called for? Is
it not arbitrary to provide that whatever may
be the circumstances in which the offence
of murder was committed, the sentence of
death shall be imposed upon the accused?”
(at page 287)
    The question was then answered in the following
manner:
“18. It is because the death sentence has
been made mandatory by Section 303 in
regard to a particular class of persons that,
as  a  necessary  consequence,  they  are
deprived of the opportunity under Section
235(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code to
show  cause  why  they  should  not  be
sentenced  to  death  and  the  court  is
relieved  from  its  obligation  under  Section
354(3) of  that  Code  to  state  the  special
reasons  for  imposing  the  sentence  of
death. The deprivation of these rights and
safeguards  which  is  bound  to  result  in
injustice is harsh, arbitrary and unjust.” 
19… To prescribe a mandatory sentence of
death for the second of such offences for
the reason that the offender was under the
sentence of life imprisonment for the first of
such  offences  is  arbitrary  beyond  the
bounds  of  all  reason.  Assuming
that Section  235(2)  of  the  Criminal
Procedure  Code  were  applicable  to  the
case and the court was under an obligation
to  hear  the  accused  on  the  question  of
sentence, it would have to put some such
question to the accused:
“You  were  sentenced  to  life
imprisonment for the offence of
375forgery. You have committed a
murder  while  you  were  under
that  sentence  of  life
imprisonment. Why should you
not be sentenced to death?”
The question carries its own refutation.  It
highlights how arbitrary and irrational it is to
provide for a mandatory sentence of death
in such circumstances . 
23.  On  a  consideration  of  the  various
circumstances which we have mentioned in
this judgment, we are of the opinion that
Section 303 of the Penal Code violates the
guarantee of equality contained in Article
14 as  also  the  right  conferred  by  Article
21 of the Constitution that no person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty
except according to procedure established
by law.” 
(at pages 293, 294 and 296)
In  a  concurring  judgment,  Chinnappa  Reddy,  J.,
struck down the Section in the following terms:
“25.  Judged in the light shed by  Maneka
Gandhi  [(1978) 1 SCC 248] and  Bachan
Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684], it is impossible
to uphold Section 303 as valid. Section 303
excludes judicial discretion. The scales of
justice are removed from the hands of the
Judge  so  soon  as  he  pronounces  the
accused guilty of the offence. So final, so
irrevocable  and  so  irrestitutable  is  the
sentence  of  death  that  no  law  which
provides for it without involvement of the
judicial mind can be said to be fair, just and
reasonable. Such a law must necessarily
be stigmatised as arbitrary and oppressive.
Section 303 is such a law and it must go
the way of all bad laws. I agree with my
Lord Chief Justice that Section 303, Indian
Penal  Code,  must  be  struck  down  as
unconstitutional.” 
376(at page 298) 
It is, therefore, clear from a reading of even the
aforesaid two Constitution Bench judgments that Article
14  has  been  referred  to  in  the  context  of  the
constitutional invalidity of statutory law to show that
such statutory law will be struck down if it is found to be
“arbitrary”.
However, the three Judge Bench in  Mcdowell
(supra)  dealt  with  the  binding  Constitution  Bench
decision in Mithu (supra) as follows (at page 739):
“45. Reference was then made by Shri G.
Ramaswamy  to  the  decision
in Mithu v. State of Punjab  [(1983) 2 SCC
277: 1983 SCC (Cri) 405] wherein Section
303 of the Indian Penal Code was struck
down. But that decision turned mainly on
Article 21 though Article 14 is also referred
to along with Article 21. Not only did the
offending provision exclude any scope for
application  of  judicial  discretion,  it  also
deprived  the  accused  of  the  procedural
safeguards  contained  in  Sections  235(2)
and  354(3)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure
Code. The ratio of the said decision is thus
of no assistance to the petitioners herein.”
A binding judgment of five learned Judges of this Court cannot be 
said to be of “no assistance” by stating that the decision turned 
mainly on Article 21, though Article 14 was also referred to. It is 
clear that the ratio of the said Constitution Bench was based both 
on Article 14 and Article 21 as is clear from the judgment of the 
four learned Judges in paragraphs 19 and 23 set out supra.78  A 
three Judge Bench in the teeth of this ratio cannot, therefore, be 
78
377said to be good law. Also, the binding Constitution   Bench decision
in Sunil Batra (supra), which held arbitrariness as a ground for 
striking down a legislative provision, is not at all referred to in the 
three Judge Bench decision in Mcdowell (supra).
(2) The second reason given is that a challenge under
Article 14 has to be viewed separately from a challenge
under Article 19, which is a reiteration of the point of
view of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras , 1950 SCR
88, that fundamental rights must be seen in watertight
compartments.   We  have  seen  how  this  view  was
upset  by  an  eleven  Judge  Bench  of  this  Court  in
Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India,  (1970) 1
SCC 248, and followed in  Maneka Gandhi  (supra).
Arbitrariness  in  legislation  is  very  much  a  facet  of
unreasonableness in Article 19(2) to (6), as has been
laid down in several Judgments of this Court, some of
which  are  referred  to  in  Om  Kumar (infra)  and,
therefore, there is no reason why arbitrariness cannot
be  used  in  the  aforesaid  sense  to  strike  down
legislation under Article 14 as well.
(3) The third reason given is that the Courts cannot sit
in  Judgment  over  Parliamentary  wisdom.   Our  law
reports are replete with instance after instance where
Parliamentary  wisdom  has  been  successfully  set  at
378naught by this Court because such laws did not pass
muster on account of their being “unreasonable”, which
is referred to in Om Kumar (infra).    
We must never forget the admonition given by
Khanna, J. in State of Punjab v. Khan Chand, (1974)
1 SCC 549.  He said:
“12.It would be wrong to assume that there
is an element of judicial arrogance in the act
of the Courts in striking down an enactment.
The Constitution has assigned to the Courts
the function of determining as to whether
the  laws  made  by  the  Legislature  are  in
conformity  with  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution.  In  adjudicating  the
constitutional validity of statutes, the Courts
discharge  an  obligation  which  has  been
imposed upon them by the Constitution. The
Courts would be shirking their responsibility
if they hesitate to declare the provisions of a
statute to be unconstitutional, even though
those provisions are found to be violative of
the Articles of the Constitution. Articles 32
and  226  are  an  integral  part  of  the
Constitution  and  provide  remedies  for
enforcement of fundamental rights and other
rights  conferred  by  the  Constitution.
Hesitation  or  refusal  on  the  part  of  the
Courts  to  declare  the  provisions  of  an
enactment  to  be  unconstitutional,  even
though  they  are  found  to  infringe  the
Constitution  because  of  any  notion  of
judicial humility would in a large number of
cases have the effect of taking away or in
any case eroding the remedy provided to
the  aggrieved  parties  by  the  Constitution.
Abnegation in matters affecting one’s own
interest  may  sometimes  be  commendable
but abnegation in a matter where power is
conferred to protect the interest of others
379against measures which are violative of the
Constitution  is  fraught  with  serious
consequences. It is as much the duty of the
courts  to  declare  a  provision  of  an
enactment  to  be  unconstitutional  if  it
contravenes any article of the Constitution
as it is theirs to uphold its validity in case it
is found’ to suffer from no such infirmity.” 
This again cannot detain us.
(4)  One more reason given is that the proportionality
doctrine, doubtful of application even in administrative
law, should not, therefore, apply to this facet of Article
14  in  constitutional  law.   Proportionality  as  a
constitutional  doctrine  has  been  highlighted  in  Om
Kumar  v. Union  of  India,  (2001)  2  SCC  386  at
400-401 as follows:
“30.  On  account  of  a  Chapter  on
Fundamental  Rights  in  Part  III  of  our
Constitution right from 1950, Indian Courts
did not suffer from the disability similar to
the one experienced by English Courts for
declaring  as  unconstitutional  legislation on
the  principle  of  proportionality  or  reading
them  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the
charter  of  rights.  Ever  since  1950,  the
principle  of  “proportionality”  has  indeed
been applied vigorously to legislative (and
administrative)  action  in  India.  While
dealing  with  the  validity  of  legislation
infringing  fundamental  freedoms
enumerated  in  Article  19(1)  of  the
Constitution of India — such as freedom of
speech  and  expression,  freedom  to
assemble  peaceably,  freedom  to  form
associations and unions, freedom to move
freely  throughout  the  territory  of  India,
380freedom to reside and settle in any part of
India — this Court has occasion to consider
whether  the  restrictions  imposed  by
legislation  were  disproportionate  to  the
situation and were not the least restrictive
of the choices. The burden of proof to show
that the restriction was reasonable lay on
the State. “Reasonable restrictions” under
Articles 19(2) to (6) could be imposed on
these  freedoms  only  by  legislation  and
courts had occasion throughout to consider
the  proportionality  of  the  restrictions.  In
numerous  judgments  of  this  Court,  the
extent  to  which  “reasonable  restrictions”
could  be  imposed  was  considered.
In Chintamanrao v. State of M.P. [AIR 1951
SC 118: 1950 SCR 759] Mahajan, J. (as he
then  was)  observed  that  “reasonable
restrictions” which the State could impose
on the fundamental rights “should not be
arbitrary or of an excessive nature,  beyond
what  is  required  in  the  interests  of  the
public”.  “Reasonable”  implied  intelligent
care and deliberation, that is, the  choice of
a course which reason dictated. Legislation
which arbitrarily or excessively invaded the
right could not be said to contain the quality
of reasonableness unless it struck a  proper
balance between the rights guaranteed and
the control permissible under Articles 19(2)
to  (6).  Otherwise,  it  must  be  held  to  be
wanting in that quality. Patanjali Sastri, C.J.
in State of Madras  v. V.G. Row [AIR 1952
SC 196: 1952 SCR 597: 1952 Cri LJ 966],
observed that the Court must keep in mind
the  “nature  of  the  right  alleged  to  have
been infringed, the underlying purpose of
the  restrictions  imposed,  the  extent  and
urgency of the evil sought to be remedied
thereby, the disproportion of the imposition,
the prevailing conditions at the time”. This
principle  of  proportionality  vis-à-vis
legislation  was  referred  to  by  Jeevan
Reddy,  J.  in State  of  A.P. v. McDowell  &
Co. [(1996) 3 SCC 709] recently. This level
381of scrutiny has been a common feature in
the High Court and the Supreme Court in
the last fifty years. Decided cases run into
thousands.
31. Article 21 guarantees liberty and has
also  been  subjected  to  principles  of
“proportionality”. Provisions of the Criminal
Procedure  Code,  1974  and  the  Indian
Penal  Code  came  up  for  consideration
in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1980)
2  SCC  684  :  1980  SCC  (Cri)  580]  the
majority  upholding  the  legislation.  The
dissenting  judgment  of  Bhagwati,  J.
(see Bachan  Singh  v. State  of
Punjab [(1982) 3 SCC 24 : 1982 SCC (Cri)
535]) dealt elaborately with “proportionality”
and held that the punishment provided by
the statute was  disproportionate .
32. So far as Article 14 is concerned, the
courts  in  India  examined  whether  the
classification  was  based  on  intelligible
differentia and whether the differentia had a
reasonable  nexus  with  the  object  of  the
legislation.  Obviously,  when  the  courts
considered  the  question  whether  the
classification  was  based  on  intelligible
differentia, the courts were examining the
validity of the differences and the adequacy
of the differences. This is again nothing but
the  principle  of  proportionality. There  are
also cases where legislation or rules have
been struck down as being arbitrary in the
sense  of  being  unreasonable  [see  Air
India v. Nergesh  Meerza  [(1981)  4  SCC
335: 1981  SCC  (L&S) 599] (SCC  at  pp.
372-373)]. But this latter aspect of striking
down  legislation  only  on  the  basis  of
“arbitrariness” has been doubted in  State of
A.P. v. McDowell  and  Co.  [(1996)  3  SCC
709] .” 
38245.The thread of reasonableness runs through
the  entire  fundamental  rights  Chapter.   What  is
manifestly  arbitrary  is  obviously  unreasonable  and
being contrary to the rule of law, would violate Article
14.  Further, there is an apparent contradiction in the
three  Judges’  Bench  decision  in  McDowell (supra)
when  it  is  said  that  a  constitutional  challenge  can
succeed on the ground that a law is “disproportionate,
excessive or unreasonable”, yet such challenge would
fail on the very ground of the law being “unreasonable,
unnecessary  or  unwarranted”.   The  arbitrariness
doctrine when  applied to legislation obviously would
not involve the latter challenge but would only involve a
law  being  disproportionate,  excessive  or  otherwise
being  manifestly  unreasonable.   All  the  aforesaid
grounds,  therefore,  do  not  seek  to  differentiate
between State action in its various forms, all of which
are interdicted if they fall foul of the fundamental rights
guaranteed to persons and citizens in Part III of the
Constitution.
46.We only need to point out that even after
McDowell  (supra),  this  Court  has  in  fact  negated
statutory law on the ground of it being arbitrary and
383therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India.   In  Malpe  Vishwanath  Acharya  v. State  of
Maharashtra, (1998) 2 SCC 1, this Court held that
after passage of time, a law can become arbitrary, and,
therefore, the freezing of rents at a 1940 market value
under the Bombay Rent Act would be arbitrary and
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India (see
paragraphs 8 to 15 and 31).
47.Similarly in  Mardia Chemicals Ltd. & Ors.
v. Union of India & Ors. etc. etc.,  (2004) 4 SCC 311
at 354, this Court struck down Section 17(2) of the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets
and  Enforcement  of  Security  Interest  Act,  2002,  as
follows: 
“64.  The  condition  of  pre-deposit  in  the
present case is bad rendering the remedy
illusory  on  the  grounds  that:  ( i)  it  is
imposed  while  approaching  the
adjudicating authority of the first instance,
not in appeal, ( ii) there is no determination
of the amount due as yet, ( iii) the secured
assets  or  their  management  with
transferable interest is already taken over
and under control of the secured creditor,
(iv) no special reason for double security in
respect of an amount yet to be determined
and settled, (v) 75% of the amount claimed
by no means would be a meagre amount,
and  (vi)  it  will  leave  the  borrower  in  a
position where it would not be possible for
him to raise any funds to make deposit of
38475% of the undetermined demand. Such
conditions  are  not  only  onerous  and
oppressive  but  also  unreasonable  and
arbitrary.  Therefore,  in  our  view,
sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Act is
unreasonable,  arbitrary  and  violative  of
Article 14 of the Constitution.” 
48.In two other fairly recent judgments namely
State of Tamil Nadu  v. K. Shyam Sunder , (2011) 8
SCC  737  at  paragraphs  50  to  53,  and  A.P. Dairy
Development  Corpn.  Federation  v. B.  Narasimha
Reddy, (2011) 9 SCC 286 at paragraph 29, this Court
reiterated the position of law that a legislation can be
struck  down  on  the  ground  that  it  is  arbitrary  and
therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
49. In a Constitution Bench decision in Ashoka Kumar
Thakur v. Union of India , (2008) 6 SCC 1 at 524, an
extravagant  argument  that  the  impugned  legislation
was intended to please a section of the community as
part of the vote catching mechanism was held to not be
a legally acceptable plea and rejected by holding that:
“219. A  legislation  passed  by  Parliament
can be challenged only on constitutionally
recognised grounds. Ordinarily, grounds of
attack  of  a  legislation  is  whether  the
legislature  has  legislative  competence  or
whether  the  legislation  is  ultra  vires  the
provisions of the Constitution. If any of the
provisions  of  the  legislation  violates
fundamental rights or any other provisions
385of the Constitution, it could certainly be a
valid ground to set aside the legislation by
invoking  the  power  of  judicial  review.  A
legislation  could  also  be  challenged  as
unreasonable if it violates the principles of
equality adumbrated in our Constitution or it
unreasonably  restricts  the  fundamental
rights under Article 19 of the Constitution. A
legislation cannot be challenged simply on
the ground of unreasonableness because
that by itself does not constitute a ground.
The validity of a constitutional amendment
and the validity of plenary legislation have
to  be  decided  purely  as  questions  of
constitutional  law.  This  Court  in  State  of
Rajasthan  v. Union of India  [(1977) 3 SCC
592] said: (SCC p. 660, para 149)
“149. … if a question brought
before  the  court  is  purely  a
political  question  not  involving
determination  of  any  legal  or
constitutional right or obligation,
the court would not entertain it,
since  the  court  is  concerned
only  with  adjudication  of  legal
rights and liabilities.”
50.  A  subsequent  Constitution  Bench  in  K.T.
Plantation (P) Ltd.  v. State of Karnataka , (2011) 9
SCC  1,  dealt  with  the  constitutional  validity  of  the
Roerich  and  Devikarani  Roerich  Estate  (Acquisition
and Transfer) Act, 1996, the legal validity of Section
110  of  the  Karnataka  Land  Reforms  Act,  1961,
Notification No. RD 217 LRA 93 dated 8-3-1994 issued
by the State Government thereunder and the scope
and content of Article 300-A of the Constitution. While
386examining the validity of a legislation which deprives a
person of property under Article 300-A, this Court when
faced with Mcdowell (supra) pointed out that (at page
58):
“203. Even  in McDowell  case  [(1996)  3
SCC 709], it was pointed out that some or
other  constitutional  infirmity  may  be
sufficient  to  invalidate  the  statute.  A
three-Judge  Bench  of  this  Court
in McDowell  &  Co.  case  [(1996)  3  SCC
709]  held  as  follows:  (SCC  pp.  737-38,
para 43)
“43. … The power of Parliament
or  for  that  matter,  the  State
Legislatures is restricted in two
ways.  A  law  made  by
Parliament  or  the  legislature
can be struck down by courts
on  two  grounds  and  two
grounds  alone  viz.  ( 1) lack  of
legislative competence and ( 2)
violation  of  any  of  the
fundamental  rights  guaranteed
in Part III of the Constitution or
of  any  other  constitutional
provision.  There  is  no  third
ground.… No enactment can be
struck down by just saying that
it is arbitrary or unreasonable.
Some  or  other  constitutional
infirmity has to be found before
invalidating  an  Act.  An
enactment  cannot  be  struck
down on the ground that court
thinks it unjustified. Parliament
and the legislatures, composed
as  they  are  of  the
representatives  of  the  people,
are supposed to know and be
aware  of  the  needs  of  the
people  and  what  is  good  and
387bad for them. The court cannot
sit  in  judgment  over  their
wisdom.”
204. A  two-Judge  Bench  of  this  Court
in Union of India v. G. Ganayutham  [(1997)
7 SCC 463: 1997 SCC (L&S) 1806], after
referring to McDowell case  [(1996) 3 SCC
709]  stated  as  under:  ( G.  Ganayutham
case [(1997) 7 SCC 463: 1997 SCC (L&S)
1806] , SCC p. 476, para 22)
“22. … That a statute can be
struck  down  if  the  restrictions
imposed  by  it  are
disproportionate  or  excessive
having regard to the purpose of
the statute and  that  the  court
can  go  into  the  question
whether  there  is  a
proper balancing of  the
fundamental  right  and  the
restriction  imposed,  is  well
settled.”
205. Plea  of  unreasonableness,
arbitrariness,  proportionality,  etc.  always
raises an element of subjectivity on which a
court  cannot  strike  down  a  statute  or  a
statutory  provision,  especially  when  the
right to property is no more a fundamental
right. Otherwise  the  court  will  be
substituting  its  wisdom  to  that  of  the
legislature,  which  is  impermissible  in  our
constitutional democracy.”

51. In a recent Constitution Bench decision in Natural
Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No.1
of 2012, (2012) 10 SCC 1, this Court went into the
arbitrariness  doctrine  in  some  detail.   It  referred  to
388Royappa  (supra), Maneka Gandhi  (supra) and Ajay
Hasia  (supra) (and quoted from paragraph 16 which
says  that  “…  the  impugned  legislative  or  executive
action would plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of
equality under Article 14 would be breached…”).  It
then  went  on  to  state  that  “arbitrariness”  and
“unreasonableness” have been used interchangeably
as follows:
“103.  As  is  evident  from  the  above,  the
expressions  “arbitrariness”  and
“unreasonableness”  have  been  used
interchangeably and in fact, one has been
defined in terms of the other. More recently,
in Sharma Transport  v. Govt. of A.P. [(2002)
2 SCC 188], this Court has observed thus:
(SCC pp. 203-04, para 25)
“25. … In order to be described
as arbitrary, it must be shown
that it was not reasonable and
manifestly arbitrary. The
expression ‘arbitrarily’ means:
in an unreasonable manner, as
fixed or done capriciously or at
pleasure, without adequate
determining principle, not
founded in the nature of things,
non-rational, not done or acting
according to reason or
judgment, depending on the will
alone.”
(at page 81)
After  stating  all  this,  it  then  went  on  to  comment,
referring  to  McDowell  (supra) that no  arbitrary  use
389should be made of the arbitrariness doctrine.  It then
concluded (at page 83):
“107.  From  a  scrutiny  of  the  trend  of
decisions it is clearly perceivable that the
action  of  the  State,  whether  it  relates  to
distribution of largesse, grant of contracts
or allotment of land, is to be tested on the
touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution.
A law may not be struck down for being
arbitrary  without  the  pointing  out  of  a
constitutional  infirmity  as     McDowell
case     [(1996)  3  SCC  709]  has  said.
Therefore,  a  State  action   has   to   be
tested  for  constitutional   infirmities   qua
Article  14  of  the   Constitution.   The
action   has   to   be    fair,     reasonable,
non-discriminatory,  transparent,
non-capricious,  unbiased,  without
favouritism  or  nepotism,  in  pursuit  of
promotion  of  healthy  competition  and
equitable  treatment.  It  should  conform  to
the norms which are rational, informed with
reasons and guided by public interest, etc.
All  these  principles  are  inherent  in  the
fundamental conception of Article 14. This
is  the  mandate  of  Article  14  of  the
Constitution of India.” 
[Emphasis Supplied]
On a reading of this judgment, it is clear that this Court
did not read  McDowell  (supra) as being an authority
for the proposition that legislation can never be struck
down  as  being  arbitrary.   Indeed  the  Court,  after
referring to all the earlier judgments, and  Ajay Hasia
(supra) in particular, which stated that legislation can
390be struck down on the ground that it is “arbitrary” under
Article  14,  went  on  to  conclude  that  “arbitrariness”
when  applied  to  legislation  cannot  be  used  loosely.
Instead,  it  broad  based  the  test,  stating  that  if  a
constitutional infirmity is found, Article 14 will interdict
such infirmity. And a constitutional infirmity is found in
Article  14  itself  whenever  legislation  is  “manifestly
arbitrary”;  i.e.  when   it  is  not  fair,  not  reasonable,
discriminatory, not transparent, capricious, biased, with
favoritism or nepotism and not in pursuit of promotion
of  healthy  competition  and  equitable  treatment.
Positively speaking, it should conform to norms which
are rational, informed with reason and guided by public
interest, etc. 
52. Another Constitution Bench decision reported as
Dr. Subramanian Swamy  v. Director, Central Bureau
of  Investigation ,  (2014)  8  SCC  682,  dealt  with  a
challenge to Section 6-A of the Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act, 1946.  This Section was ultimately
struck  down  as  being  discriminatory  and  hence
violative of Article 14. A specific reference had been
made to the Constitution Bench by the reference order
in  Dr.  Subramanian  Swamy  v.  Director,  Central
391Bureau of Investigation , (2005) 2 SCC 317, and after
referring  to  several  judgments  including  Ajay  Hasia
(supra), Mardia  Chemicals  (supra), Malpe
Vishwanath Acharya  (supra) and McDowell  (supra),
the reference inter alia was as to whether arbitrariness
and unreasonableness, being facets of Article 14, are
or  are  not  available  as  grounds  to  invalidate  a
legislation. 
After referring to the submissions of counsel, and
several  judgments  on  the  discrimination  aspect  of
Article 14, this Court held:
“48. In E.P.  Royappa  [E.P.
Royappa v. State of T.N., (1974) 4 SCC 3:
1974 SCC (L&S) 165], it has been held by
this  Court  that  the  basic  principle  which
informs both Articles 14 and 16 are equality
and  inhibition  against  discrimination.  This
Court observed in para 85 as under: (SCC
p. 38)
“85. … From a positivistic point
of view, equality is antithetic to
arbitrariness.  In  fact  equality
and  arbitrariness  are  sworn
enemies;  one  belongs  to  the
rule of law in a republic while
the  other,  to  the  whim  and
caprice of an absolute monarch.
Where an act is arbitrary, it is
implicit  in  it  that  it  is  unequal
both according to political logic
and  constitutional  law  and  is
392therefore violative of Article 14,
and  if  it  affects  any  matter
relating to public employment, it
is  also  violative  of  Article  16.
Articles  14  and  16  strike  at
arbitrariness in State action and
ensure fairness and equality of
treatment.”
Court's approach
49. Where  there  is  challenge  to  the
constitutional validity of a law enacted by
the legislature, the Court must keep in view
that  there  is  always  a  presumption  of
constitutionality  of  an  enactment,  and  a
clear  transgression  of  constitutional
principles must be shown. The fundamental
nature  and  importance  of  the  legislative
process  needs  to  be  recognised  by  the
Court and due regard and deference must
be  accorded  to  the  legislative  process.
Where  the  legislation  is  sought  to  be
challenged  as  being  unconstitutional  and
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,
the  Court  must  remind  itself  to  the
principles  relating  to  the  applicability  of
Article  14  in  relation  to  invalidation  of
legislation. The two dimensions of Article 14
in  its  application  to  legislation  and
rendering  legislation  invalid  are  now  well
recognised  and  these  are:  ( i)
discrimination, based on an impermissible
or invalid classification, and ( ii) excessive
delegation  of  powers;  conferment  of
uncanalised and unguided powers on the
executive, whether in the form of delegated
legislation  or  by  way  of  conferment  of
authority to pass administrative orders—if
such conferment is without any guidance,
control or checks, it is violative of Article 14
of the Constitution. The Court also needs to
be  mindful  that  a  legislation  does  not
become  unconstitutional  merely  because
there is another view or because another
method may be considered to be as good
393or even more effective, like any issue of
social, or even economic policy. It is well
settled  that  the  courts  do  not  substitute
their views on what the policy is.” 
(at pages 721-722)
Since the Court ultimately struck down Section 6-A
on  the  ground  that  it  was  discriminatory, it  became
unnecessary to  pronounce  on  one  of  the  questions
referred to it, namely, as to whether arbitrariness could
be a ground for invalidating legislation under Article 14.
Indeed the Court said as much in paragraph 98 of the
judgment as under (at page 740):
“Having considered the impugned provision
contained  in  Section  6-A  and  for  the
reasons indicated above, we do not think
that it is necessary to consider the other
objections  challenging  the  impugned
provision in the context of Article 14.”
53.However,  in  State  of  Bihar  v.  Bihar
Distillery Ltd. , (1997) 2 SCC 453 at paragraph 22, in
State of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli , (2012) 6 SCC 312 at
paragraphs 17 to 19, in Rajbala v. State of Haryana &
Ors., (2016) 2 SCC 445 at paragraphs 53 to 65 and
Binoy Viswam  v. Union of India , (2017) 7 SCC 59 at
paragraphs 80 to 82,  McDowell (supra) was read as
being an absolute bar to the use of “arbitrariness” as a
394tool to strike down legislation under Article 14. As has
been noted by us earlier in this judgment,  Mcdowell
(supra) itself is per incuriam, not having noticed several
judgments of Benches of equal or higher strength, its
reasoning  even  otherwise  being  flawed.  The
judgments, following McDowell (supra) are, therefore,
no longer good law. 
54.To complete the picture, it is important to
note that subordinate legislation can be struck down on
the ground that it is arbitrary and, therefore, violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution.  In  Cellular Operators
Association  of  India  v.  Telecom  Regulatory
Authority  of  India , (2016)  7  SCC  703,  this  Court
referred to earlier precedents, and held:
“Violation of fundamental rights
42. We have already seen that one of the
tests for challenging the constitutionality of
subordinate legislation is that subordinate
legislation  should  not  be  manifestly
arbitrary.  Also,  it  is  settled  law  that
subordinate legislation can be challenged
on  any  of  the  grounds  available  for
challenge  against  plenary  legislation.
(See Indian  Express  Newspapers
(Bombay) (P) Ltd.  v. Union of India  [(1985)
1 SCC 641: 1985 SCC ( Tax) 121], SCC at
p. 689, para 75.)
43. The test of “manifest arbitrariness” is
well  explained  in  two  judgments  of  this
Court. In Khoday Distilleries Ltd.  v. State of
395Karnataka [(1996) 10 SCC 304], this Court
held: (SCC p. 314, para 13)
“13. It is next submitted before
us that the amended Rules are
arbitrary,  unreasonable  and
cause  undue  hardship  and,
therefore,  violate  Article  14  of
the  Constitution.  Although  the
protection  of  Article  19(1)( g)
may  not  be  available  to  the
appellants,  the  Rules  must,
undoubtedly, satisfy the test of
Article 14, which is a guarantee
against  arbitrary  action.
However,  one  must  bear  in
mind  that  what  is  being
challenged  here  under  Article
14 is not executive action but
delegated legislation.  The tests
of arbitrary action which apply
to  executive  actions  do  not
necessarily apply to delegated
legislation.  In  order  that
delegated  legislation  can  be
struck  down,  such  legislation
must be manifestly arbitrary; a
law  which  could  not  be
reasonably  expected  to
emanate  from  an  authority
delegated with the law-making
power.  In Indian  Express
Newspapers  (Bombay)  (P)
Ltd. v. Union  of  India  [(1985)  1
SCC  641  :  1985  SCC  (Tax)
121],  this  Court  said  that  a
piece of subordinate legislation
does not carry the same degree
of immunity which is enjoyed by
a  statute  passed  by  a
competent  legislature.  A
subordinate legislation may be
questioned under Article 14 on
the  ground  that  it  is
unreasonable;  ‘unreasonable
not in the sense of not being
396reasonable,  but  in  the  sense
that  it  is  manifestly  arbitrary’ .
Drawing a comparison between
the law in England and in India,
the Court further observed that
in  England  the  Judges  would
say, ‘Parliament never intended
the  authority  to  make  such
Rules;  they  are  unreasonable
and  ultra  vires’.  In  India,
arbitrariness is not a separate
ground since it will come within
the embargo of Article 14 of the
Constitution.  But  subordinate
legislation must be so arbitrary
that it could not be said to be in
conformity  with  the  statute  or
that it offends Article 14 of the
Constitution.”                          
44.  Also,  in Sharma  Transport  v. State  of
A.P. [(2002) 2 SCC 188], this Court held:
(SCC pp. 203-04, para 25)
“25.  …  The  tests  of  arbitrary
action  applicable  to  executive
action do not necessarily apply
to delegated legislation. In order
to  strike  down  a  delegated
legislation as arbitrary it has to
be  established  that  there  is
manifest arbitrariness. In order
to be described as arbitrary, it
must be shown that it was not
reasonable  and  manifestly
arbitrary.  The  expression
“arbitrarily”  means:  in  an
unreasonable manner, as fixed
or  done  capriciously  or  at
pleasure,  without  adequate
determining  principle,  not
founded in the nature of things,
non-rational, not done or acting
according  to  reason  or
judgment, depending on the will
alone.”
397(at pages 736-737)
55.It will be noticed that a Constitution Bench of
this Court in Indian Express Newspapers  v. Union of
India, (1985) 1 SCC 641, stated that it was settled law
that subordinate legislation can be challenged on any
of the grounds available for challenge against plenary
legislation.  This being the case, there is no rational
distinction between the two types of legislation when it
comes to this ground of challenge under Article 14.
The  test  of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as  laid
down  in  the  aforesaid  judgments  would  apply  to
invalidate legislation as well as subordinate legislation
under  Article  14.   Manifest  arbitrariness,  therefore,
must be something done by the legislature capriciously,
irrationally  and/or  without  adequate  determining
principle.   Also,  when  something  is  done  which  is
excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would
be manifestly arbitrary.  We are, therefore, of the view
that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest arbitrariness
as  pointed out by us  above would apply to  negate
legislation as well under Article 14.
56.Applying the test of manifest arbitrariness to
the case at hand, it is clear that Triple Talaq is a form of
398Talaq  which  is  itself  considered  to  be  something
innovative, namely, that it is not in the Sunna, being an
irregular or heretical form of Talaq.  We have noticed
how in  Fyzee’s book  (supra), the Hanafi school of
Shariat law, which itself recognizes this form of Talaq,
specifically states that though lawful it is sinful in that it
incurs the wrath of God.  Indeed, in  Shamim Ara  v.
State  of  U.P. , (2002)  7  SCC  518,  this  Court  after
referring to a number of authorities including certain
recent High Court judgments held as under:
“13…The correct law of  talaq as ordained
by the Holy Quran is that  talaq must be for
a reasonable cause and be preceded by
attempts  at  reconciliation  between  the
husband and the wife by two arbiters —
one from the wife’s family and the other
from  the  husband’s;  if  the  attempts
fail, talaq may  be  effected  (para  13).
In Rukia  Khatun  case  [(1981)  1  Gau  LR
375]  the  Division  Bench  stated  that  the
correct  law  of  talaq,  as  ordained  by  the
Holy Quran, is: ( i) that “talaq” must be for a
reasonable cause; and ( ii) that it must be
preceded  by  an  attempt  of  reconciliation
between the husband and the wife by two
arbiters, one chosen by the wife from her
family and the other by the husband from
his.  If  their  attempts  fail,  “ talaq”  may  be
effected.  The  Division  Bench  expressly
recorded its dissent from the Calcutta and
Bombay views which, in their opinion, did
not lay down the correct law. 
14. We are in respectful agreement with the
abovesaid  observations  made  by  the
learned Judges of the High Courts.”
  
399(at page 526)
57.Given the fact that Triple Talaq is instant and
irrevocable,  it  is  obvious  that  any  attempt  at
reconciliation between the husband and wife by two
arbiters from their families, which is essential to save
the  marital  tie,  cannot  ever  take  place.   Also,  as
understood  by the  Privy  Council  in  Rashid  Ahmad
(supra), such Triple Talaq is valid even if it is not for
any reasonable cause, which view of the law no longer
holds good after Shamim Ara (supra).  This being the
case, it is clear that this form of Talaq is manifestly
arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken
capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without
any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it.  This form
of Talaq must, therefore, be held to be violative of the
fundamental  right  contained  under  Article  14  of  the
Constitution  of  India.   In  our  opinion,  therefore,  the
1937 Act, insofar as it seeks to recognize and enforce
Triple Talaq, is within the meaning of the expression
“laws in force” in Article 13(1) and must be struck down
as  being  void  to  the  extent  that  it  recognizes  and
enforces Triple Talaq.  Since we have declared Section
2 of the 1937 Act to be void to the extent indicated
400above on the narrower ground of it being manifestly
arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground
of discrimination in these cases, as was argued by the
learned Attorney General and those supporting him.

HEMANT GUPTA, J.
The Criminal Appeal No. 1266 of 2010 preferred by Mahendran
(Accused No. 3), and Criminal Appeal No. 1260 of 2010 preferred by
Ravi (Accused No. 1), Singaravelu (Accused No. 2), Iyappan (Accused
No.  4),  Rajendran  (Accused  No.  5),  Selvaraj  (Accused  No.  6),
Karunakaran  (Accused  No.  7),  Arunachalam  (Accused  No.  8)  and
1Sundaramoorthy (Accused No. 9) arise out of a common judgment by
the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on 26.09.2008. The High
Court has acquitted Mohan (Accused No. 10), Ravi (Accused No. 12), P .
Mohan (Accused No. 13), Palanivel Thevar (Accused No. 14) and Kannan
(Accused No. 15) from all charges by granting them benefit of doubt.
The accused are referred to with reference to their status before the trial
court.
2. The prosecution had put on trial twenty-four persons for various
offences, but  the  learned trial  court  found the  charges  proved only
against Accused Nos. 1-10 and 12-15 and sentenced to imprisonment as
per the order passed in respect of the offences proved against them,
whereas, Manivasagam (Accused No.11), Ganapathy (Accused No. 16)
Muruganandam (Accused No. 17), Saravanan (Accused No. 18), Kathiah
(Accused No. 19), Maiyilaiyam (Accused No. 20), Subbaian (Accused No.
21), Santhanam (Accused No. 22), Mariappan (Accused No. 23) and
Kannan (Accused No. 24) were acquitted. 
3.Learned counsel for the appellants states that Accused Nos. 8 and
9  have  died  during  the  pendency  of  the  appeals.   Resultantly,  the
appeals survive in respect of Accused Nos. 1 to 7 only. One of the
accused Balakrishnan had died even before the Charge-sheet could be
filed, therefore, was not included in the report filed. 
4.Prosecution case was set in motion on the basis of statement of
PW1-Ganesamoorthy,  resident  of  Kumbakonam  and  son-in-law  of
Murugaiyan-deceased. He stated that on 12.03.1994, he along with his
2father went to Nangarari, but due to darkness, they decided to stay in
his father-in-law’s house at Neikuppai.
5.He stated that his father-in-law shared the dispute between him
and  the  Caste  Hindus  that  evening  and  that  dispute  was  getting
intensified and that someone had set fire on the thatched hut in the
Pilaiyar street.  He also said that a Panchayat was going to be conducted
in this regard but he had not informed the police.  He stated that on
13.03.1994 at about 7.30 AM, he heard noise at the place of residence
when his father had gone to have tea.  He and his father-in-law came
outside  to  see  what  happened.   At  that  stage,  A-1  to  A-9  and
Balakrishnan (since dead) son of Raamaiya Konur were standing with
stones and aruvals (sickles). They exhorted that till such time you are
alive, you will not allow caste Hindus to live and we won’t leave you
alive.  At that stage, Ravi (A-1) poured the kerosene from tin container
and Singaravelu (A-2) set fire to the roof.  The hut was set ablaze. His
father-in-law ran towards backside of the house, frightened of his life. He
also ran behind him.  He was questioned as to why he was running?
Murugaiyan ran towards barber Mahalingam’s house on School street.
But the accused hit on the head of Murugaiyan with the sickle, inflicting
injuries on the head, hand, leg and back.  His father-in-law, Murugaiyan
was lying in the pool of blood in front of the house of PW13-Mahalingam
having injuries on both legs and shoulders. About 100 persons of caste
Hindus were standing around Murugaiyan.  At that time PW3-Ramesh
and PW2-Raja came but they escaped after being hit with stones. He
also escaped without being seen by anybody.  On the basis of such
3statement,  FIR  Ext.P-13  was  lodged  at  about  8.45  AM  against  ten
accused. 
6.PW19-Ramakrishnan is the retired Police Inspector who recorded
statement on the basis of which First Information Report was lodged. He
was  entrusted  with  the  investigations.  He  sent  FIR  to  the  Judicial
Magistrate, Thiruvarur at 09.30 A.M.  He then went to the place of
occurrence in the Village Neikuppai. The sketch Ex.P .18 was prepared of
a place in front of Murugaiyan’s house and prepared an observation
Memo Ex.P .2. He also prepared sketch Ex.P .19 and observation Memo
Ex.P .3 after seeing the place where the dead body was lying at 10.20
hours on that day.  He prepared inquest report Ex.P .30 and sent the
body  for  post-mortem.  He  associated  the  informant  PW1-
Ganesamoorthy,  PW2-  Raja,  PW3-Ramesh,  PW4-Ravanan  and  PW5-
Lakshmi, wife of the deceased, for investigations and recorded their
statements. He also associated PW6-Sankaran and Mariappan(A-23) and
recorded their statements. He recovered burnt bamboo piece, a burnt
coconut leaf lattice, one burnt polyester sari in red, blue, white and
green colours, a burnt sprayer nozzle, and some burnt paddy as well as
one plank taken from the burnt cart at about 1615 hours, recorded in
Ex.P .4. The materials mentioned therein Ex.P .4 are M.Os. 10 to 15. He
also took in possession the blood stains from the seating area in west of
the house of Mahalingam; a sample earth without blood stain scratched
from the above area; blood-stained earth was taken from the place
where the dead body of Murugaiyan was lying as well as earth without
blood stain was taken from the same place. He also associated some
4other witnesses to complete investigations. 
7.    It  was  on  13.3.1994,  ten  accused  initially  mentioned  by  the
informant  Ganesamoorthy  were  arrested.  The  disclosure  statement
Ex.P .6 was recorded of accused Ravi (A-1), and on the basis of disclosure
statement five sickles were recovered from A-1 to A-5 and Balakrishnan,
whereas, bamboo sticks of different lengths were recovered from A-6 to
A-9.  On 15.03.1994, he arrested other accused who stood acquitted,
therefore, not relevant for the purpose of present appeals.  In the cross-
examination, he denied that the complaint Ex. P .1 was not registered at
the stated time and that the same was prepared after discussion and
that the FIR Ex.P .13 was sent to Court on that day at around 4.00 PM. He
deposed that deceased Murugaiyan belongs to Scheduled Caste and
denied  that the  dead  body  was  lying  in  the  seating  area  near the
Manickam’s  house.  He  also  associated  PW13-Mahalingam,  his  wife
Theivakani, daughter Raji, son Selvam in the course of investigations
and recorded their statements.  But he stated that he had not gone to
Manickam’s house as mentioned by these persons.  On completion of
the investigations, Charge-sheet was filed. The accused pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial.  
8.The post-mortem on the dead body of Murugaiyan was conducted
by PW17-Dr. Razool. He found the following external injuries on the
person of the deceased: - 
“1. 6” long Elliptical, Horizontal cut injury with clear cut
edges of skin, extending from angle of left mandible,
cross left neck, up to lateral process of spine. “C2”,
5without involving mastoid Bone on clearing dark blood
clots.  The sterno cleido Mastoid muscles and jugular
veins & carotid arteries are found cut. 
2. 1” below injury No.(1) a similar cut injury horizontal,
extending from Adam’s apple, across left of neck up to

blood oozing.
3. Similar cut injury 3” long horizontal and 1” below
injury No. 2 over root of neck involving clavicle bone
left. 
4. Irregular edged 2” x 1” x ½“ serrated edged abrasion
over left scapula. 
5.  10”  long  lacerated  injury  with  clear  edges  very
superficial running obliquely across left breast to right
ribs with two packets on injury 1” deep lying on the
same line with 3” gap in between. This injury does not
involve heart, lungs and abdominal viscera. 
6. Cut injury, 4” long horizontal and lateral side of left
thigh, 4” above knee joint just embracing femur bone.
7.  Below  left  knee  joint  similar  injury  4”  long  over
lateral side of leg, completely cutting away the Tibia
and Fibula bones. 
8. 2” below injury No. (7), 3” long cut injury over lateral
side, 2” deep.
9. Complete severing of left wrist separating the hand
from its joints, cutting the radial and ulnar arteries with
only ½ “ broad-skin bridging the gap. 
10. They only injury found on the right side of body is
6”  long  cut  injury,  running  over  the  shoulder  from
scapula  to  anterior  of  shoulder  cutting  the  tender
insertion of biceps muscles chopping of the head of
humerus bone.
OTHERS:
Brain  pale  not  liquefied.  Skull  bone,  spinal,  spinal
column  not  fractured.  Stomach,  spleen,  liver,  kidney
and lungs are pale, but not injured. Heart no injury.  All
the left chambers are empty with little clots.” 
6The cause of death was injury Nos. 1 and 2 due to severing of left
carotid artery and jugular veins, leading to profuse haemorrhage, hypo-
volume shock and death in sequence. He produced his post-mortem
report as Ex.P .14.  
9.PW17-Dr. Razool also examined informant PW1-Ganesamoorthy on
13.3.1994 at 6.00 PM alleged to be assaulted by stones at 7.30 AM on
the same day. The following injuries were reported:
“1. Contusion left ear lobe with tenderness.
 2. Abrasion with edema 1” diameter nape of neck.”
10.PW17 Dr. Razool also examined PW2-Raja and PW3-Ramesh on the
same day and found the following injuries respectively:
“1.  ½  ”  diameter  recent  abrasion  with  surrounded
edema over right eye brow.”
“1.  Recent  contusion  with  blood  clot  ½“  diameter
abrasion over left crown of head. 
2.T enderness over left half muscles.”
11.T o  prove  the  allegations  against  the  accused,  the  prosecution
examined  PW1-Ganesamoorthy,  the  informant  and  son-in-law  of  the
deceased, PW2-Raja, PW3-Ramesh, PW5-Lakshmi wife of the deceased
and PW13-Mahalingam, all residents of Village Neikuppai, PW4-Ravanan
resident of Narsingampettai.  Both the Courts have relied upon the
statements  of  PW1-Ganesamoorthy,  PW2-Raja  and  PW3-Ramesh  to
7convict the appellants. 
12.Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  argued  that  PW1-
Ganesamoorthy is not a witness of occurrence, but has been introduced
falsely. In support of the argument that the witness was not present at
the place of the occurrence, the following aspects were pointed out:- 
a). It is unbelievable that son-in-law will stay with his in-laws more
so when his own village is around 15 Kms away only.
b). In his first statement Ex.P .1, he has not stated that he got
injuries with the stones pelted by the aggressors, whereas, he has
tried to prove his presence on the basis of self-inflicted injuries
which were found not to be more than one hour old by Dr. Razool,
who examined him at around 6.20 PM.   
c).  The FIR is ante-timed as there is no reason as to why FIR was
delivered to the Judicial Magistrate at 4.00 PM but not soon after it
was  dispatched  around  9.30  AM.  It  is  unbelievable  that  the
constable would not know that the Magistrate would not come to
the Court being Sunday as he could have delivered the FIR at the
residence of the Officer.  
d).PW1-Ganesamoorthy  has  given  parentage  of  all  the  ten
accused  in  the  statement  Ext.P .1,  but  in  Court  he  could  not
disclose the parentage of A4, A6 and Balakrishnan (since died).
Thus, FIR was lodged after consultation, therefore, the delay in the
receipt of FIR by the Magistrate
813.It is also argued that the place of occurrence is opposite house of
Manickam as is deposed by PW13-Mahalingam, but the prosecution has
shifted the place of occurrence near the house of Mahalingam. Since the
place of occurrence itself has not been proved on the statement of
PW13 Mahalingam, the prosecution story in respect of the manner of
occurrence cannot be accepted.  It is stated that PW1-Ganesamoorthy is
not reliable and truthful witness, therefore, unworthy of reliance. 
14.It is also argued that PW1-Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja and PW3-
Ramesh  have  roped  in  many  other  accused  during  the  course  of
investigations and that such part of the statement has not been found
to be a truthful version resulting into acquittal of accused Nos. 10, 12,
13, 14 and 15 in appeal, whereas, some other accused were acquitted
by the learned trial court itself.  It is thus argued that the statements of
witnesses are unreliable and lack credibility, therefore, such statements
cannot be relied upon for the conviction of the appellants.  
15.Learned counsel for the appellants relies upon judgments reported
in Ram Laxman vs. State of Rajasthan1, Noushad alias Noushad
Pasha and Others vs. State of Karnataka2 and Suraj Mal Vs.
State (Delhi Administration)3 to contend that if the testimony of the
witness is found to be unreliable in respect of part of the statement,
then the other part of the statement cannot be made basis to convict
the accused. 
1 (2016) 12 SCC 389
2 (2015) 2 SCC 513
3 (1979) 4 SCC 725
916.It is argued that Ravi (A-1) is said to have suffered a disclosure
statement under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as per the
statement of PW8-Veeraiyan and got recovered five sickles, but, the
Investigating Officer has distributed the recovery to the five different
accused. 
17.The explanation of the prosecution witnesses that doctor was not
available at Kudavasal stands controverted on the basis of statement of
DW4-Assistant  Doctor  Balakumaravelu  in  Kudavasal  Government
Hospital who has deposed that the doctor was available. Therefore,
medical examination in respect of injuries which in opinion of doctor is
not more than one hour earlier totally discredits the prosecution story. 
18.The  story  of  receipt  of  injuries  by  the  witnesses  PW1-
Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja and PW3-Ramesh is highly doubtful as their
blood-stained clothes were given to the Investigating Officer after two
days, whereas, if they had received injuries on the date of occurrence, it
was mandatory for the prosecution to take into possession of the blood-
stained clothes on the day of occurrence itself.  
19.It  is  also  argued  that  PW5-Lakshmi  wife  of  the  deceased  has
named Ravi (A-1) and Singaravelu (A-2) only as the persons who had
poured kerosene and lit the match stick but has not deposed in respect
of role of the other accused.  Thus, in view of the absence of any overt
act attributed to the appellants other than A-1 and A-2, their conviction
for offences under Section 302 IPC and other offences are not made out
and they can at best be punished for the offence under Section 326 read
10with Section 149 IPC. The reliance is placed upon the Supreme Court
judgment reported as Joseph vs. State, Represented by Inspector
of  Police4 and  Najabhai  Desurbhai  Wagh  vs.  Valerabhai
Deganbhai Vagh and Others5. Learned counsel for the appellants also
argued that the prosecution has failed to prove the common object so as
to attract the offence under Section 149 IPC.
20.On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  State
pointed out that much stress has been laid on shifting the place of
occurrence from near the house of Manickam to near the house of
PW13-Mahalingam. It is argued that it is factually incorrect and the
discrepancy is minor, if any. The reliance is placed upon statement of
PW2-Raja who deposed that houses of Mahalingam and Manickam are in
the same street, one facing north and the other facing south meaning
thereby, facing to each other and they are located half a furlong from
each other.  Therefore, the place of occurrence is in the street, in which
houses of PW13-Mahalingam and Manickam are located.  The evidence
that  blood-stained  earth  and  the  sample  earth  have  been  taken  in
possession from the place of occurrence near the house of Mahalingam,
therefore, the minor discrepancy in respect of place of occurrence is
inconsequential as the occurrence is in the same street. 
21.It is also argued that PW1-Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja and PW3-
Ramesh have explained their injuries which part of their evidence has
not been challenged in their cross-examination. The statement of DW4-
4 (2018) 12 SCC 283
5 (2017) 3 SCC 261
11Balakumaravelu does not support the argument raised by the learned
counsel for the appellants as it is stated by the witness that the Doctors
give treatment to the patients in the Out-Patient Ward from 7.30 -10.30
AM and give treatment to the patients in In-Patient Ward from 10.30 AM
to 12.30 PM and then there is a lunch break from 12.30 PM – 2.00 PM.
Thereafter, the administrative work is performed up to 2.30 PM. Thus,
the witnesses have been medically examined at the earliest opportunity.
22.As per PW2-Raja, the road from Kumbakonam goes to Kudavasal,
Pudukudi and Thiruvarur.  The witness has stated that the distance
between Pudukudi and Thiruvarur is 15 K.Ms., whereas, bus will take
twenty-five minutes from Kudavasal to reach Thiruvarur.  Therefore, the
argument raised that PW1-Ganesamoorthy has manipulated his Medical
Report from a Hospital near to his residence is not correct as he has
travelled  on  the  other  side  of  his  village  as  the  Medico-Legal
Examination was conducted at Thiruvarur.  
23.Learned counsel refers to the judgement in Gangadhar Behera
and Others Vs. State of Orissa6  to contend that t he offence under
Section 149 is made out if the unlawful assembly shared common object
and  not  common  intention,  though  mere  presence  in  an  unlawful
assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a common
object.  The  common  object  is  as  set  out  in  Section  141.  It  is  not
necessary to prove overt act against a person who is alleged to be a
member of an unlawful assembly. In other words, the object should be
common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that is to say, they
6 (2002) 8 SCC 381
12should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be
formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by
no means necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few
members of the assembly and the other members may just join and
adopt it. 
24.  The  Judgment  in  Sanjeev  Kumar  Gupta  vs.  State  of  Uttar
Pradesh7 was  relied  upon  to  contend  that  Section  149  has  two
components  (i)  offence  committed  by  any  member  of  an  unlawful
assembly consisting of five or more members, and ( ii) such offence must
be committed in prosecution of the common object under Section 141
IPC of the assembly or members of that assembly knew to be likely to
be  committed  in  prosecution  of  the  common  object.  For  ‘common
object’, it is not necessary that there should be a prior concert in the
sense of a meeting of the members of the unlawful assembly.  
25.The reliance is placed upon the Judgment reported as Gangadhar
Behera to argue that the maxim “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus ” has
no application in India and the witnesses cannot be branded as liars.
The maxim “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus ” has not received general
acceptance nor has this maxim come to occupy the status of rule of law.
It is merely a rule of caution.
26.The  first  and  foremost  challenge  is  to  the  testimony  of  PW1-
Ganesamoorthy for the reason inter alia that he was not present at the
place of occurrence and that FIR has been ante dated. We do not find
any merit in the said argument. The statement of PW1-Ganesamoorthy
7 (2015) 11 SCC 69
13was recorded at 8.45 AM by PW19-Police Inspector Ramakrishnan soon
after the occurrence.  Lodging of the FIR by PW1-Ganesamoorthy is
supported by PW2-Raja and PW3-Ramesh who have found that PW1-
Ganesamoorthy was already in Police Station lodging the complaint.
The testimony of PW19-Ramakrishnan regarding lodging of FIR at 8.45
AM  is  not  discredited  in  the  cross-examination.   He  denied  such
suggestion and also the suggestion that the documents were sent to the
Court at 4.15 PM. There is nothing on record not to believe statement so
the said witnesses more of the trial court and the High Court have
believed the prosecution version in this respect.
27.In respect of manner of occurrence, PW1-Ganesamoorthy in the
cross-examination  stated  that  fifteen  hundred  people  belonging  to
different castes live in the Village Neikuppai. He denied the suggestion
that Thiruvarur Government Hospital was near to his house.  He also
disclosed the receipt of injuries on the body of his father-in-law and
denied the suggestion that he does not know how his father-in-law was
killed, how his father-in-law’s hut was set on fire and he did not go to
Neikuppai Village.  
28.In the re-examination, he deposed that five sickles recovered were
approximately  1ft in  length;  some  may  be  longer  or  shorter.  Such
statement of PW1-Ganesamoorthy is corroborated by PW2-Raja who is
resident of same Village as that of the deceased Murugaiyan.  He also
deposed that houses of PW13-Mahalingam and Manickam are situated
on the School street, one facing North and the other facing South and at
14a distance of half a furlong.  At the time of incident Manickam’s house
was locked and people came running to Manickam’s house from PW13
Mahalingam’s house. Similar is the statement of PW3-Ramesh that Ravi
(A-1) has poured the kerosene from a tin container on the roof of hut of
the Murugaiyan and Singaravelu (A-2) set ablaze the hut.  Even PW5-
Lakshmi wife of the deceased also deposed that he was Ravi (A-1) who
poured kerosene and Singaravelu (A-2) who lit the matchstick. She has
stated that there were other twenty or thirty people standing around as
a group.  The fact that she has not named other accused, will not
absolve the role of the appellants, as their presence is disclosed by
three other prosecution witnesses i.e. PW1-Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja
and PW3-Ramesh. 
29.The presence of witnesses examined by the prosecution at the
place of occurrence is based upon the appreciation of the evidence by
the two Courts.  We do not find that such appreciation is perverse or
wholly  untenable  which  may  warrant  interference  in  the  present
appeals. 
30.The argument that it is unbelievable that son-in-law will not stay
with his in-laws, when his own village is around 15 KMs away, is purely
conjectural.  There  is  no  reasonable  basis  to  hold  that  PW1-
Ganesamoorthy  would  not  stay  with  his  father-in-law  in  the
circumstances explained by him. 
31.The argument that in statement Ex.P .1, PW1-Ganesamoorthy has
not stated the injuries suffered by him, will render his presence at the
15time of occurrence as doubtful. The said fact when examined in the
context of a complete statement loses its significance.  As per PW1-
Ganesamoorthy soon after the incident, he went to Kudavasal located at
the distance of 4 KMs from Neikuppai Village when he lodged the Report
as statement Ex.P .1 and thereafter he went to Thiruvarur Government
Hospital. The Kudavasal and Thiruvarur are located on the other side of
his village.
32.PW17-Dr. Razool, an Assistant Surgeon in Thiruvarur Government
Hospital conducted post-mortem examination at 4.30 PM. Thereafter, he
conducted Medico-Legal Examination of PW1-Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja
and  PW3-Ramesh.  He  proved  injury  report  Ex.P .15-Report  of  PW1,
Ex.P .16-Report of PW2-Raja and Ex.P .17-Report of PW3-Ramesh. He has
deposed that the injuries are possible in the manner disclosed by the
witnesses.  In the cross-examination, he disclosed that he cannot say
possible time of causing the injuries found on the persons of three
witnesses but he opined that the injuries could have been caused within
one  hour  before  he  examined  them.   The  opinion  of  the  Doctor  in
respect of the timing of injuries is not conclusive based on possibility of
injuries  within  one  hour  of  the  examination  when  the  presence  of
prosecution witnesses as also the role attributed to each appellant’s
presence has been found to be proved by the oral testimony.  The
opinion  of  an  expert  witness  cannot  be  given  preference  over  the
primary statement of the witnesses in respect of manner of injuries
suffered by them. 
1633.In respect of the argument that FIR was delivered at 4.45 PM on
13.03.1994  to  the  Judicial  Magistrate  at  Nagapattinam,  though  the
report was said to be sent at 9.30 AM, again does not create doubt on
the prosecution version.  The argument that the competent Magistrate
was  at  Thiruvarur  but  the  FIR  has  been  delivered  to  the  Judicial
Magistrate, Nagapattinam which shows that the FIR was ante-timed, is
again not acceptable.  PW15-H.C. Narayanan, deposed that he went to
Thiruvarur and waited for the arrival of the Magistrate. Since, it was a
holiday,  he  handed  over  the  FIR  to  the  Judicial  Magistrate  at  his
residence at Pauthiramanickam at 4.45 PM.  Therefore, the delay in the
receipt of the FIR by the Judicial Magistrate is explained and cannot be
made basis to reject the case of the prosecution as the FIR was proved
to be lodged soon after the occurrence from the testimony of PW19-
Police Inspector Ramakrishnan.
34.In respect of an argument that PW1-Ganesamoorthy has given
parentage of all the ten accused in the statement Ex.P .1, but could not
disclose the parentage of three accused in Court shows that the first
version was lodged after prior consultation, is again not tenable. The FIR
was lodged soon after the occurrence when PW2-Raja and PW3-Ramesh
residents of the same village reached the Police Station. Therefore, the
fact that he could not recollect the fathers name of three of the accused
would not create doubt on the case set up by the prosecution. 
35.The argument that the place of occurrence is based upon the
statement of PW13-Mahalingam who deposed that the dead body was
17lying cut in front of Manickam’s house and that the members of the
Dravid Kazhagham left the body in the seating area of his house and
that  blood  of  the  deceased  was  pooled  at  the  seating  area  of
Manickam’s house, we find that such argument cannot be accepted. 
36.PW6-Sankaran, Village Administrative Officer reached the scene of
occurrence immediately on hearing about the incident and deposed that
the dead body of Murugaiyan was lying in front of PW13-Mahalingam’s
house. PW7-Kollimalai has also deposed that the bloodstained earth was
seized from the house of PW13-Mahalingam in his presence and in the
presence  of  Kunjupillai.   The  fact  remains  that  houses  of  PW13-
Mahalingam and that of Manickam are in the same street and at a
distance of half a furlong. The witnesses have deposed the house of
Manickam was  locked  and  residents  from  the  house  of  Mahalingam
rushed to the place where dead body was lying. It explains the reason
as to why the witnesses have deposed that the dead body was lying
near the house of PW13.
37.The learned trial court found that some discrepancies can be due
to minor errors of perception or observation or due to lapse of memory.
It may be noticed that the witnesses were being examined after more
than six years of the occurrence.  
38.It is argued that prosecution has put on trial twenty-four accused,
but presence of A-11 and A-16 to A-24 was doubted by learned trial
court and they were acquitted on benefit of doubt.  Five accused, A-10,
A-12, A-13, A-14 and A-15 have been granted benefit of doubt in appeal
18as well. The argument that the entire case set up is based on falsehood
and thus not reliable for conviction of the appellants, is not tenable.  It is
well settled that the maxim “ falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus ” has no
application in India only for the reason that some part of the statement
of the witness has not been accepted by the trial court or by the High
Court.  Such is the view taken by this Court in  Gangadhar Behera’s
case, wherein the Court held as under:-  
“15. T o the same effect is the decision in  State of
Punjab v. Jagir Singh8 and Lehna v. State of Haryana9.
Stress was laid by the accused-appellants on the non-
acceptance of evidence tendered by some witnesses
to contend about desirability to throw out the entire
prosecution case. In essence prayer is to apply the
principle of “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus ” (false in
one thing, false in everything). This plea is clearly
untenable. Even if a major portion of the evidence is
found to be deficient, in case residue is sufficient to
prove guilt of an accused, notwithstanding acquittal
of  a  number  of  other  co-accused  persons,  his
conviction can be maintained. It is the duty of the
court  to separate the grain from  the chaff.  Where
chaff can be separated from the grain, it would be
open  to  the  court  to  convict  an  accused
notwithstanding  the  fact  that  evidence  has  been
found to be deficient to prove guilt of other accused
persons.  Falsity  of a  particular  material  witness  or
material  particular  would  not  ruin  it  from  the
beginning to end. The maxim “ falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus”  has  no  application  in  India  and  the
witnesses  cannot  be  branded  as  liars.  The  maxim
“falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus ” has not received
general  acceptance  nor  has  this  maxim  come  to
occupy the status of rule of law. It is merely a rule of
caution. All that it amounts to, is that in such cases
testimony may be disregarded, and not that it must
be  disregarded.  The  doctrine  merely  involves  the
question of weight of evidence which a court may
apply in a given set of circumstances, but it is not
8 (1974) 3 SCC 277
9 (2002) 3 SCC 76
19what may be called “a mandatory rule of evidence”.
(See Nisar Alli v. State of U.P .10 ) Merely because some
of the accused persons have been acquitted, though
evidence  against  all  of  them,  so  far  as  direct
testimony went, was the same does not lead as a
necessary  corollary  that  those  who  have  been
convicted must also be acquitted. It is always open to
a court to differentiate the accused who had been
acquitted  from  those  who  were  convicted.
(See Gurcharan  Singh  v. State  of  Punjab11).  The
doctrine is a dangerous one specially in India for if a
whole  body  of  the testimony  were  to  be  rejected,
because a witness was evidently speaking an untruth
in some aspect, it is to be feared that administration
of  criminal  justice  would  come  to  a  dead  stop.
Witnesses just cannot help in giving embroidery to a
story, however, true in the main. Therefore, it has to
be  appraised  in  each  case  as  to  what  extent  the
evidence  is  worthy  of  acceptance,  and  merely
because  in  some  respects  the  court  considers  the
same to be insufficient for placing reliance on the
testimony of a witness, it does not necessarily follow
as a matter of law that it must be disregarded in all
respects as well. The evidence has to be sifted with
care. The aforesaid dictum is not a sound rule for the
reason that one hardly comes across a witness whose
evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or at any
rate  exaggeration,  embroideries  or  embellishment.
(See Sohrab v. State of M.P .12  and Ugar Ahir v. State
of Bihar13.) An attempt has to be made to, as noted
above, in terms of felicitous metaphor, separate the
grain from the chaff, truth from falsehood. Where it is
not  feasible  to  separate  the  truth  from  falsehood,
because grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up,
and in the process of separation an absolutely new
case has to be reconstructed by divorcing essential
details presented by the prosecution completely from
the context and the background against which they
are made, the only available course to be made is to
discard  the  evidence  in  toto.  (See  Zwinglee
Ariel v. State  of  M.P .14  and Balaka  Singh v. State  of
Punjab15.)  As  observed  by  this  Court  in  State  of
10 AIR 1957 SC 366
11 AIR 1956 SC 460
12 (1972) 3 SCC 751
13  AIR 1965 SC 277
14  AIR 1954 SC 15
15 (1975) 4 SCC 511
20Rajasthan v. Kalki16 normal discrepancies in evidence
are  those  which  are  due  to  normal  errors  of
observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of
time, due to mental disposition such as shock and
horror at the time of occurrence and those are always
there however honest and truthful a witness may be.
Material  discrepancies  are  those  which  are  not
normal, and not expected of a normal person. Courts
have to label the category to which a discrepancy
may be categorized. While normal discrepancies do
not corrode the credibility of a party's case, material
discrepancies do so. These aspects were highlighted
recently  in Krishna  Mochi  v. State  of  Bihar17.
Accusations have been clearly established against the
accused-appellants in the case at hand. The courts
below have categorically indicated the distinguishing
features in evidence so far as the acquitted and the
convicted accused are concerned.”
39. Therefore,  the  entire  testimony  of  the  witnesses  cannot  be
discarded only because, in certain aspects, part of the statement has
not been believed. 
40.The judgment referred to by learned counsel for the appellants in
Ram Laxman’s  case is not applicable to the facts of the present case,
as in that case, the Court found the testimony of the witnesses as
undependable and unreliable so as to grant benefit to some accused
while maintaining the conviction of the others. The Court noticed that
the  maxim  “falsus  in  uno,  falsus  in  omnibus ”  is  not  applicable.
Therefore, if the witness  is  reliable  and dependable  then the  entire
statement cannot be discarded.
41.Similarly,  in  the  case  of Noushad the  Court  found  that  the
statement of PW11 that he has witnessed the incident with much of
16 (1981) 2 SCC 752
17 (2002) 6 SCC 81
21exactitude as to which accused assaulted his brother with what weapon
cannot be said to have been really witnessed by him.  Again, in Suraj
Mal’s case, the Court was examining the legality of conviction under
the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.  It was found that
the evidence of witnesses against the two accused was inseparable and
indivisible, when on such evidence one of the accused was acquitted
and not the other accused.  
42.All these judgments are in respect of appreciation of evidence of
witnesses  in  the  facts  being  examined  by  the  Court.  The  general
principle of appreciation of evidence is that even if some part of the
evidence of witness is found to be false, the entire testimony of the
witness cannot be discarded. 
43.The argument that five aruvals (sickles) were recovered only on
the basis of disclosure statement of Ravi (A-1) is not factually correct.
Ex.P .6  is  a  disclosure  statement  of  Ravi  (A-1),  whereas,  Ex.P .8  is  a
disclosure  statement  of  Mohan  (A-10),  Subbaiyan  (A-21),  N.
Rajamanickam (died), Santhanam (A-22) and Kannan (A-24). 
44.In  presence  of  such  disclosure  statements,  a  common
memorandum of recovery as Ex.P.7 was prepared. Therefore, it is not
the confessional statement of one accused which led to recovery of
weapons  used  in  the  occurrence  but  on  the  basis  of  confessional
statements  of  the  accused,  a  common  recovery  memorandum  was
prepared.  Such common Memo of recovery of weapons used in the
occurrence cannot create doubt on the prosecution story.
2245.The  argument  that  non-availability  of  a  Doctor  at  Kudavasal
stands controverted on the statement of DW4-Balakumaravelu is again
not tenable.  DW4-Balakumaravelu is Assistant Doctor in the Kudavasal
Government Hospital who has deposed that doctors were on duty on the
date of occurrence.  He has deposed that Doctor Geetha was on duty in
Out-Patient Ward from 7.30 AM.  There was no duty at the Out-patient
ward from 3.00 to 5.00 PM on that day.  As is given on the record that
the Village Kudavasal falls on the way to Thiruvarur and since the Doctor
was not available, the injured were examined at Government Hospital
Thiruvarur.   The  testimony  of  PW17-Doctor  Razool  has  not  been
questioned on the ground that the Doctor was available at Kudavasal
Hospital and injuries should have been examined at that place as well.
The only suggestion put to witness is that the injuries could have been
caused within one hour before he examined them.  The possibility of
injuries is an opinion which cannot controvert the primary statement of
the witness about the receipt of the injuries in the fateful morning of
13.3.1994.
46.The prosecution has proved the active role played by Ravi (A-1)
and Singaravelu (A-2). The presence of other accused at the time of
occurrence as part of the crowd who lynched Murugaiyan also stands
proved. There is physical severance on the parts of the body of the
deceased. The presence of the appellants were disclosed in the First
Information Report recorded soon after the occurrence. Therefore, there
is no reason to hold that the accused- appellants have been implicated
falsely.  It may be noticed that the appellants are also Backward Class
23Hindus.  The prosecution witnesses PW1-Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja and
PW3-Ramesh have clearly defined the role of each of the appellants in
the  occurrence  which  has  taken  the  life  of  the  Murugaiyan.  Such
statement is corroborated by PW5-Lakshmi wife of the deceased who
deposed that it is Ravi (A-1) and Singaravelu (A-2) who poured kerosene
and  lit  the  matchstick  respectively  along  with  twenty-thirty  other
persons.  Therefore, the active participation of all the appellants stands
proved on record.  
47.We do not find any merit in the argument that all the appellants
cannot be said to have common object in view, in the absence of an
overt  act  attributed  to  the  appellants  other  than  Ravi  (A-1)  and
Singaravelu (A-2)  by PW5-Lakshmi. Even PW5-Lakshmi is  categorical
that Ravi (A-1) and Singaravelu (A-2) were accompanied by twenty-thirty
other people.  Though she has not named other accused but the fact
that  the  other  accused  have  been  named  specifically  by  PW1-
Ganesamoorthy, PW2-Raja and PW3-Ramesh, clearly shows that all the
accused came as a group to attack the hut of the deceased and then
took his life. 
48.In  the  Joseph’s  case  as  relied  upon  by  the  counsel  for  the
appellants, the Court held that if the prosecution succeeds in improving
the existence of common object amongst the accused and that accused
actuated the prosecution of common object and knew that the death
was likely to be committed, the conviction under Section 302 IPC read
with 149 is made out. The Court held as under: 
24“11.3.  What is important in each case is to find out if
the  offence  was  committed  to  accomplish  the
common object of the assembly or was the one which
the  members  knew  to  be  likely  to  be  committed.
Once the court finds that the ingredients of Section
149 IPC are fulfilled, every person who at the time of
committing  that  offence  was  a  member  of  the
assembly has to be held guilty of that offence. After
such a finding, it would not be open to the court to
see as to who actually did the offensive act nor would
it be open to the court to require the prosecution to
prove which of the members did which of the above
two  ingredients.  Before  recording  the  conviction
under Section 149 IPC, the essential ingredients of
Section 141 IPC must be established. ”
49.In the above case, the Court held that as to whether the members
of the unlawful assembly really had the common object to cause the
murder  of  the  deceased  has  to  be  decided  on  the  facts  and
circumstances  of  each  case.  The  nature  of  weapons  used  by  such
members, the manner and sequence of attack made by those members
on the deceased and the circumstances under which the occurrence
took place are the factors to decide as to whether, the accused had
common object. It is an inference to be deduced from the facts and
circumstances of each case.   The Court held that there is no evidence to
prove that Accused 1 to 11 had any common object to commit the
murder of Kennedy which activated all of them to join in furtherance of
the common object.
50.In  Najabhai’s  case,  there  was  no  evidence  that there  was  a
common object of murder amongst the accused, as accused No. 1 was
infuriated on the question by the appellant regarding the damage to the
electricity pole near his house.  There is nothing on record to suggest
any previous enmity between the parties.  Such judgment is again on
25the appreciation of the evidence in the case in hand.
51.In Gangadhar Behera’s  case, while considering the Section 141
of IPC, it was held that common object is not common intention as the
mere presence in an unlawful assembly cannot render a person liable
unless  there  was  a  common  object  and  he  was  actuated  by  that
common object.  Common object does not require a prior concert and a
common meeting of minds before the attack.  It is enough if each has
the same object in view if the five or more act as an assembly to
achieve  that object. The  “common object” of an assembly is  to be
ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it,
and  from  a  consideration  of  all  the  surrounding  circumstances. The
Court  while  considering  the  plea  that  definite  roles  ascribed  to  the
accused and therefore Section 149 is not applicable was not accepted. It
is held as under:
“25. The other plea that definite roles have not been
ascribed to the accused and therefore Section 149 is
not applicable, is untenable. A four-Judge Bench of
this Court in Masalti case18 observed as follows: (AIR
p. 210, para 15)
“15. Then it is urged that the evidence given by
the  witnesses  conforms  to  the  same  uniform
pattern and since no specific part is assigned to
all the assailants, that evidence should not have
been accepted. This  criticism  again is not well
founded. Where a crowd  of assailants who are
members of an  unlawful assembly proceeds to
commit an offence of murder in pursuance of the
common  object  of  the  unlawful  assembly,  it  is
often  not  possible  for  witnesses  to  describe
accurately the part played by each one of the
assailants. Besides, if a large crowd of persons
armed  with  weapons  assaults  the  intended
victims, it may not be necessary that all of them
18 AIR 1965 SC 202
26have to take part in the actual assault. In the
present case, for instance, several weapons were
carried  by  different  members  of  the  unlawful
assembly, but it appears that the guns were used
and that was enough to kill 5 persons. In such a
case, it would be unreasonable to contend that
because  the  other  weapons  carried  by  the
members  of  the  unlawful  assembly  were  not
used, the  story  in regard  to  the said  weapons
itself should be rejected. Appreciation of evidence
in such a complex case is no doubt a difficult task;
but  criminal  courts  have  to  do  their  best  in
dealing with such cases and it is their duty to sift
the evidence carefully and decide which part of it
is true and which is not.”
26. T o similar effect is the observation in  Lalji v. State
of U.P .19 It was observed that: (SCC p. 441, para 8)
“Common object of the unlawful assembly can be
gathered from the nature of the assembly, arms
used by them and the behaviour of the assembly
at  or  before  the  scene  of  occurrence.  It  is  an
inference  to  be  deduced  from  the  facts  and
circumstances of each case.”
27. In State  of  U.P . v. Dan  Singh20 it  was  observed
that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove
which of the members of the unlawful assembly did
which or what act. Reference was made to  Lalji case
where it was observed that: (SCC p. 442, para 9)
“While overt act and active participation may
indicate  common  intention  of  the  person
perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the
unlawful  assembly  may  fasten  vicariously
criminal liability under Section 149.”
28. Above being the position, we find no substance in
the  plea  that  evidence  of  eyewitnesses  is  not
sufficient to fasten guilt by application of Section 149.
So  far  as  the  observations  made  in  Kamaksha  Rai
case21 are  concerned,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  the
decision in the said case was rendered in a different
factual scenario altogether. There is always peril in
treating the words of a judgment as though they are
words  in  a  legislative  enactment,  and  it  is  to  be
remembered that judicial utterances are made in the
setting  of  the  facts  of  a  particular  case.
19 (1989) 1 SCC 437
20 (1997) 3 SCC 747 
21 (1999) 8 SCC 701
27Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different
fact  may  make  a  world  of  difference  between
conclusions  in  two  cases  (see  Padma  Sundara
Rao v. State of T.N.22). It is more so in a case where
conclusions relate to appreciation of evidence in a
criminal  trial,  as  was  observed  in  Krishna  Mochi
case.”
52.In Sanjeev Kumar’s  case, the conviction under Section 302 with
the aid of Section 149 was maintained when, it was found that there
was no object of killing but only of stopping the deceased and other
contestants from elections. It was held that it cannot be ruled out that
the common intention to kill might have arisen on the spur of the
moment. 
53.It is held in the Gangadhar Behera’s  case that the words of a
judgment cannot be treated as words in a legislative enactment. It is to
be remembered that judicial orders are made in the setting of the facts
of a particular case. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different
fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases,
therefore, whether there was common object of the accused in each
case  would  depend  upon  cumulative  effects  of  the  facts  of  that
particular case.  
54.In the present case, both the Courts below have found that the
appellants have common object in burning the hut of the deceased and
also attacking the deceased with aruvals (sickles) in view of the role of
the  deceased  in  the  affairs  of  Panchayat  against  caste  Hindus.
Therefore, appellants other than Ravi (A-1) and Singaravelu (A-2) cannot
22 (2002) 3 SCC 533
28be treated differently to convict them for the offences under Section 326
read with Section 149 IPC as all the accused were part of the unlawful
assembly which has taken the life  of the deceased in a murderous
attack on the fateful morning of 13.03.1994.  
55.Consequently, we do not find any merit in the present appeals and
the same are dismissed. 
The appellants are on bail.  They shall surrender within four weeks
to undergo their remaining part of the sentence.

(Arising out of SLP(C) No.34830/2016)
J U D G M E N T
Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud 
CIVIL APPEAL No.12015 OF 2018
1.Leave granted.
2.This appeal arises from a judgment of a Division Bench of the Bombay
High Court dated 1 April 2016. 
13.The father of the respondent, Ramlakhan Tripathi was employed as a
Technician, Grade-I in Central Railways at Mumbai. He died in harness on
28  November  2009.  The  deceased  employee  had  contracted  a  second
marriage during the subsistence of his first marriage. The respondent is the
son born from the second marriage of the employee. The second marriage,
as  it  appears,  was  contracted  in  1987.  The  respondent  applied  for
compassionate appointment on the death of his father. The application was
rejected on 6 March 2012 by the Railway Authorities. Aggrieved by the
denial of compassionate appointment, the respondent moved an Original
Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Tribunal having
held in favour of the respondent and upon the dismissal of a petition seeking
review,  the  Union  of  India  and  the  Railway  Authorities  instituted  writ
proceedings before the Bombay High Court. 
4.In support of the writ petition, the appellants relied upon a circular of
the Railway Board dated 2 January 1992. The said circular is extracted
below:
“Government of India
Ministry of Railway
(Railway Board)
R.B.E. No.1 of 1992
Supplementary Circular
No.5 to Master CIRCULAR
The General Manager(P)
C. Rly. and others
Sub: Appointment on Compassionate grounds cases of 
second widow and her wards.
2It  is  clarified  that  in  the  case  of  railway
employees  dying  in  harness  etc.  leaving  more  than  one
widow  along  with  children  born  to  the  2nd wife,  while
settlement dues may be shared by both the widows due to
Court  orders  or  otherwise  on  merits  of  each  case,
appointments  on  compassionate  grounds  to  the  second
widow and her children are not to be considered unless the
administration has permitted the second marriage, in special
circumstances, taking into account the persons law etc.
2.The fact that the second marriage is not permissible is
invariably clarified in the terms and conditions advised to the
offer of initial appointment.
3.This  may  be  kept  in  view  and  the  cases  for
compassionate  appointment  to  the  second  widow  or  her
wards need not be forwarded to Railway Board.
4.Kindly acknowledge receipt.
Sd/-
(P.L.N. Sarma)
Deputy Director, Estt. (N)
Railway Board”
5.The High Court held that:
(i)Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 recognizes the legitimacy of a
child born from a marriage which is null and void under the provisions of
Section 11;
(ii)The circular of the Railway Board dated 2 January 1992 has been set
aside by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Namita Goldar v
Union of India1; and
(iii) In the decision of this Court in Rameshwari Devi v State of Bihar2  the
1(2010) 1 Cal.LJ 464
2(2000) 2 SCC 431
3entitlement of the family of a deceased employee to pensionary benefits
has been upheld notwithstanding the fact that the deceased had, during
his lifetime, contracted a second marriage.
6.Principally on the above foundation, the High Court found no reason to
differ with the view of the Central Administrative Tribunal and observed that
the direction to the railway authorities was only to consider the case of the
respondent for compassionate appointment on its merits.
7.Assailing the judgment of the High Court, Mr. Aman Lekhi, learned
Additional Solicitor General submitted that:
(i)Compassionate appointment is not an alternate source of employment or
recruitment;
(ii)Compassionate  appointment  is  not  a  matter  of  a  heritable  right  and
depends on the extant rules or schemes under which such benefits or
facilities are envisaged;
(iii) Section 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 envisages that a child
born from a marriage which is void under Section 11 has a claim only in
respect of the property of the parents and no further;
(iv)The decision of this Court in Rameshwari Devi  (supra) is distinguishable
since pension, it is well settled, is a matter of right as a result of the
previous service of an employee and therefore represents an entitlement
in the nature of property; and
(v) On the other hand, the heirs of a deceased employee have no right to
4compassionate appointment. Hence, it is open to the Union Government
or  its  agencies  and  departments,  while  designing  a  policy  of
compassionate appointment to stipulate that such a facility will not be
available either to the spouse of a second marriage or, for that matter, to
the children who are born from that marriage. The State can do so as a
legitimate instrument of its policy to discourage bigamy.
8.On the other hand, Mr. Arjun Singh Bhati and Mr. Apurv Parashar, the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, submitted that:
(i)Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act clearly enunciates that children who
are born from a marriage which is null and void are legitimate;
(ii)While the Union Government may well assert that a second spouse is not
entitled to compassionate appointment, such a facility cannot be denied
to the children from a second marriage, once their legitimacy operates as
a matter of law; and
(iii)The decision in  Namita Goldar  (supra) struck down the circular of the
Railway Board dated 2 January 1992. The decision was not challenged
and has in fact been implemented. Hence, the subsequent circular which
was issued by the Railway Board on 3 April 2013, reiterating the earlier
circular, is contrary to the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Namita
Goldar (supra), which was rendered on 1 February 2010.
9.The rival submissions fall for our consideration. 
10.Certain  basic  principles  in  regard  to  the  grant  of  compassionate
5appointment  are  settled  by  the  decisions  of  this  Court.  In  Director  of
Education (Secondary)  v Pushpendra Kumar ,3 this Court while discussing
the object of compassionate appointment observed thus: 
“8. The  object  underlying  a  provision  for  grant  of
compassionate employment  is  to enable the family  of  the
deceased employee to tide over the sudden crisis resulting
due to death of the bread-earner which has left the family in
penury  and  without  any  means  of  livelihood.  Out  of  pure
humanitarian consideration and having regard to the fact that
unless some source of livelihood is provided, the family would
not be able to make both ends meet, a provision is made for
giving gainful appointment to one of the dependants of the
deceased who may be eligible for such appointment…” 
In State Bank of India  v Raj Kumar,4 this Court while discussing the claim
over compassionate appointment held as follows: 
“8. It is now well settled that appointment on compassionate
grounds is not a source of recruitment. On the other hand it is
an exception to the general rule that recruitment to public
services should be on the basis of merit, by an open invitation
providing  equal  opportunity  to  all  eligible  persons  to
participate  in  the  selection  process.  The  dependants  of
employees, who die in harness, do not have any special claim
or right to employment, except by way of the concession that
may be extended by the employer under the rules or by a
separate scheme, to enable the family of the deceased to get
over the sudden financial crisis. The claim for compassionate
appointment is therefore traceable only to the scheme framed
by the employer for such employment and there is no right
whatsoever outside such scheme.  An appointment under the
scheme can be made only if the scheme is in force and not
after it is abolished/withdrawn. It follows therefore that when a
scheme  is  abolished,  any  pending  application  seeking
appointment under the scheme will also cease to exist, unless
saved. The mere fact that an application was made when the
scheme was in force, will not by itself create a right in favour
of the applicant.”        (Emphasis supplied)  
3 (1998) 5 SCC 192
4 (2010) 11 SCC 661
6In V Sivamurthy v State of Andhra Pradesh ,5 this Court summarised the
principles relating to compassionate appointment as follows: 
“18. (a) Compassionate appointment based only on descent
is impermissible.  Appointments in public service should be
made strictly on the basis of open invitation of applications
and comparative merit, having regard to Articles 14 and 16 of
the  Constitution  of  India.  Though  no  other  mode  of
appointment is permissible, appointments on compassionate
grounds are a well-recognised exception to the said general
rule,  carved  out  in  the  interest  of  justice  to  meet  certain
contingencies…
 (c) Compassionate appointment can neither be claimed, nor
be granted,  unless the rules governing the service permit
such  appointments.  Such appointments  shall  be  strictly  in
accordance with the scheme governing such appointments
and against existing vacancies …”
(Emphasis supplied)  
11.The policy of compassionate appointment is premised on the death of
an employee while in harness. The death of an employee is liable to render
the  family  in  a  position  of  financial  hardship  and  need.  Compassionate
appointment  is  intended  to  alleviate  the  hardship  that  the  family  of  a
deceased  employee  may  face  upon  premature  death  while  in  service.
Compassionate  appointment,  in  other  words,  is  not  founded  merely  on
parentage  or  descent,  for  public  employment  must  be  consistent  with
equality  of  opportunity  which  Article  16  of  the  Constitution  guarantees.
Hence, before a claim for compassionate appointment is asserted by the
family of a deceased employee or is granted by the State, the employer
must have rules or a scheme which envisage such appointment. It is in that
sense that it is a trite principle of law that there is no right to compassionate
appointment. Even where there is a scheme of compassionate appointment,
5 (2008) 13 SCC 730
7an application for engagement can only be considered in accordance with
and  subject  to  fulfilling  the  conditions  of  the  rules  or  the  scheme.  The
submission which has been urged on behalf of the Union of India by the
learned Additional Solicitor General is premised on the basis that there is no
right  to  compassionate  appointment.  There  can  be  no  doubt  about  the
principle that there is no right as such to compassionate appointment but
only an entitlement, where a scheme or rules envisaging it exist, to be
considered in accordance with the provisions. 
12.The real issue in the present case, however, is whether the condition
which has been imposed by the circular of the Railway Board under which
compassionate appointment cannot be granted to the children born from a
second marriage of a deceased employee (except where the marriage was
permitted  by  the  administration  taking  into  account  personal  law,  etc)
accords with basic notions of fairness and equal treatment, so as to be
consistent with Article 14 of the Constitution. While answering this issue, it
would be necessary to advert to the provisions of Section 16 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 which provide thus:
“16. Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.-(1)
Notwithstanding that marriage is null and void under section
11,  any  child  of  such  marriage  who  would  have  been
legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate,
whether such child is born before or after the commencement
of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976),
and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of
that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage
is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act.
(2)Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of a
voidable marriage under section 12, any child begotten or
8conceived before the decree is made, who would have been
the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at the date
of the decree it had been dissolved instead of being annulled,
shall be deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding
the decree of nullity.
(3)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2)
shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage
which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree of
nullity under section 12, any rights in or to the property of any
person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the
passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of
possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not
being the legitimate child of his parents.”
13.In sub-section (1) of Section 16, the legislature has stipulated that a
child  born  from  a  marriage  which  is  null  and  void  under  Section  11  is
legitimate, regardless of whether the birth has taken place before or after the
commencement of Amending Act 68 of 1976. Legitimacy of a child born from
a marriage which is null and void, is a matter of public policy so as to protect
a  child  born  from  such  a  marriage  from  suffering  the  consequences  of
illegitimacy. Hence, though the marriage may be null and void, a child who is
born from the marriage is nonetheless treated as legitimate by sub-section
(1) of Section 16. One of the grounds on which a marriage is null and void
under Section 11 read with clause (i) of Section 5 is that the marriage has
been contracted when one of the parties had a spouse living at the time of
marriage. A second marriage contracted by a Hindu during the subsistence
of the first marriage is, therefore, null and void. However, the legislature has
stepped in by enacting Section 16(1) to protect the legitimacy of a child born
from such a marriage. Sub-section (3) of Section 16, however, stipulates that
such a child who is born from a marriage which is null and void, will have a
9right in the property only of the parents and none other than the parents. 
14.The issue essentially is whether it is open to an employer, who is
amenable to Part III of the Constitution to deny the benefit of compassionate
appointment which is available to other legitimate children. Undoubtedly,
while  designing  a  policy  of  compassionate  appointment,  the  State  can
prescribe the terms on which it can be granted. However, it is not open to the
State, while making the scheme or rules, to lay down a condition which is
inconsistent  with  Article  14  of  the  Constitution.  The  purpose  of
compassionate appointment is to prevent destitution and penury in the family
of a deceased employee. The effect of the circular is that irrespective of the
destitution  which  a  child  born  from  a  second  marriage  of  a  deceased
employee may face, compassionate appointment is to be refused unless the
second marriage was contracted with the permission of the administration.
Once Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 regards a child born from
a  marriage  entered  into  while  the  earlier  marriage  is  subsisting  to  be
legitimate, it would not be open to the State, consistent with Article 14 to
exclude  such  a  child  from  seeking  the  benefit  of  compassionate
appointment. Such a condition of exclusion is arbitrary and ultra vires. 
15.Even if the narrow classification test is adopted, the circular of the
Railway  Board  creates  two  categories  between  one  class  of  legitimate
children. Though the law has regarded a child born from a second marriage
as legitimate, a child born from the first marriage of a deceased employee is
alone  made  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  compassionate  appointment.  The
10salutary purpose underlying the grant of compassionate appointment, which
is to prevent destitution and penury in the family of a deceased employee
requires that any stipulation or condition which is imposed must have or bear
a reasonable nexus  to  the object  which  is sought to be  achieved.  The
learned Additional Solicitor General has urged that it is open to the State, as
part  of  its  policy  of  discouraging  bigamy  to  restrict  the  benefit  of
compassionate appointment, only to the spouse and children of the first
marriage and to deny it to the spouse of a subsequent marriage and the
children. We are here concerned with the exclusion of children born from a
second  marriage.  By  excluding  a  class  of  beneficiaries  who  have  been
deemed  legitimate  by  the  operation  of  law,  the  condition  imposed  is
disproportionate to the object sought to be achieved. Having regard to the
purpose and object of a scheme of compassionate appointment, once the
law has treated such children as legitimate, it would be impermissible to
exclude  them  from  being  considered  for  compassionate  appointment.
Children do not choose their parents. To deny compassionate appointment
though the law treats a child of a void marriage as legitimate is deeply
offensive to their dignity and is offensive to the constitutional guarantee
against discrimination. 
16.The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the decision of
this Court in Rameshwari Devi  (supra) arose in the context of the grant of
family pension to the minor children born from the second marriage of a
deceased employee. That is correct. This Court, in that context, observed
11that Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 renders the children of a
void  marriage  to  be  legitimate  while  upholding  the  entitlement  to  family
pension. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that pension is a
matter of right which accrues by virtue of the long years of service which is
rendered by the employee, entitling the employee and after his death, their
family to pension in accordance with the rules. Even if we do accept that
submission, the principle which has been laid down by this Court on the
basis of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 must find application in
the present case as well. The exclusion of one class of legitimate children
from seeking compassionate appointment merely on the ground that the
mother of the applicant was a plural wife of the deceased employee would
fail to meet the test of a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be
achieved. It would be offensive to and defeat the whole object of ensuring
the dignity of the family of a deceased employee who has died in harness. It
brings about unconstitutional discrimination between one class of legitimate
beneficiaries – legitimate children.
17.We may note at this stage, that a Division Bench of the Calcutta High
Court in Namita Goldar  (supra) quashed the circular of the Railway Board
dated 2 January 1992 to the extent that it prevented the children of the
second  wife  from  being  considered  for  appointment  on  compassionate
grounds.  Subsequently,  another  Division  Bench  of  the High Court  in  its
decision in  Eastern Coalfields Ltd.  v  Dilip Singh6 took a contrary view,
6 (2013) 3 Cal.LT 379
12without  noticing  the  earlier  decision.  We  may  advert  to  the  subsequent
decision in Eastern Coalfields Ltd . (supra) for the reason that it proceeds
on a construction of Section 16 which, in our view, is inconsistent with the
language of that provision. The Division Bench held thus:
“Section 16(1)  of  the  aforesaid  Act  creates  a legal  fiction
whereby a child born out of void marriage shall be held to be
legitimate. Section 16(3) of the said act restricts such legal
presumption to the rights of such a child only to the property
of his parents and none else.
It  is,  therefore,  clear  that  Section  16  of  Hindu
Marriages Act, 1955 presumes a child born out of a void
marriage as legitimate only for the purpose of entitling him to
claim rights in or to the property of his parents but not to any
other thing.
It  is  settled  law  that  public  post  is  not  a
heritable  property.  In  State  Bank  of  India  v.  Jaspal  Kaur
reported in (2007) 9 SCC 571 the Apex Court held that it is
clear that public post is not heritable, therefore, the right to
compassionate appointment is not a heritable property.
In fact it is an exception to the rule of regular
appointment by open competition. Such exception to the rule
of regular appointment is therefore a privilege extended by
the  employer  in  terms  of  the  scheme  for  compassionate
appointment itself. It is not a property of the deceased nor is it
a heritable right.  
In  State  of  Chhattisgarh  v.  Dhirjo  Kumar
Sengar reported in (2009) 13 SCC 600 the Apex Court held
as follows:
“Appointment on compassionate ground is an
exception  to  the  constitutional  scheme  of  equality  as
adumbrated under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India.”
For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  we  are  of  the
opinion  that  the  provisions  of  Section  16  of  the  Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 cannot come to the aid of the petitioner.
Legal presumption of legitimacy in such provision is restricted
only to the property of the deceased and not to other things .
Hence, such provision of law cannot be pressed into service
to  expand  the  privilege  of  compassionate  appointment
extended by an employee under the scheme as the same can
by no stretch of imagination be held to be the property of the
deceased employee.”                            (Emphasis supplied)
1318.The High Court has proceeded on the basis that the recognition of
legitimacy in Section 16 is restricted only to the property of the deceased
and for no other purpose. The High Court has missed the principle that
Section 16(1) treats a child born from a marriage which is null and void as
legitimate. Section 16(3), however, restricts the right of the child in respect of
property only to the property of the parents. Section 16(3), however, does
not in any manner affect the principle declared in sub-section (1) of Section
16 in regard to the legitimacy of the child. Our attention has also been drawn
to a judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in  M
Muthuraj  v Deputy General of Police, Tamil Nadu7 adopting the same
position. In the view which we have taken, we have arrived at the conclusion
that the exclusion of a child born from a second marriage from seeking
compassionate appointment under the terms of the circular of the Railway
Board is ultra vires. A Division Bench of the Madras High Court followed the
view of the Calcutta High Court in  Namita Goldar  in  Union of India  v M
Karumbayee.8 A Special leave petition filed against the judgment of the
Division Bench was dismissed by this Court on 18 September 20179.  
19.We may, however, clarify that the issue as to whether in a particular
case,  the  applicant  meets  all  the  stipulations  of  the  scheme  including
financial need and other requirements are matters which will be decided on
the facts of each individual case.

9SLP(C) arising out of Diary No.27352 of 2017
1420.Finally, it would be necessary to dwell on the submission which was
urged on behalf of the respondent that once the circular dated 2 January
1992 was struck down by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in
Namita  Goldar  (supra) and  which  was  accepted  and  has  been
implemented, it was not thereafter open to the railway authorities to rely
upon the same circular which has all India force and effect. There is merit in
the submission. Hence, we find it improper on the part of the Railway Board
to issue a fresh circular on 3 April 2013, reiterating the terms of the earlier
circular dated 2 January, 1992 even after the decision in  Namita Goldar
(supra), which attained finality. 
21.For the above reasons, we do not find any merit in the appeal. The
authorities shall take a decision in terms of this judgment on the application
for compassionate appointment in three months from today. The appeal
stands dismissed. No costs.
CIVIL APPEAL No.12016 OF 2018
(Arising out of SLP(C) No.34830/2016)
22.Leave granted.
23.In view of the judgment delivered today in companion Civil Appeal
No.12015  of  2018  and  since  the  second  marriage  was  in  any  event
permissible under Muslim Personal Law, there is no merit in the appeal. The
authorities  shall  be  entitled  to  scrutinize  whether  the  application  for
compassionate appointment  fulfills  all  other requirements,  in accordance
15with law. The process of consideration of the application shall be completed
within a period of three months from today.
24.The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.

1.Leave  granted  in  S.L.P.  (C)
No.1851 of 2009 and S.L.P. (C) No.27309 of
2012.2
2.A  relatively  simple  question
though  of  considerable  importance  in
Intellectual Property Rights jurisdiction
has presented itself for an authoritative
pronouncement of this Court in the present
bunch of appeals. The question arising will
be formulated for an answer at a subsequent
stage and for the present we will take
notice of the relevant facts giving rise to
the issue in question.
3.The  respondent  in  Civil  Appeal
Nos.4767-4769 of 2001 (P.M. Diesels Ltd.)
is the registered owner of three trade
marks, the common feature of all of which
is the words “Field Marshal”. The three
registration certificates issued by the
Registrar of Trade Marks in favour of the
respondent-Company  (through  its
predecessor) is in respect of the mark
“Field Marshal” (Registration No. 224879);3
the second certificate is in respect of
trade mark “Field Marshal” in lettering
style (Registration No. 252070) and the
last certificate is in respect of trade
mark “FM Field Marshal” (Registration No.
252071-B).  The  first  registration
certificate is dated 16.10.1964 and the
second and third registration certificates
are dated 4.10.1968.
4.It appears that some time in the
year  1982  the  appellants-Patel  Field
Marshal & Anr. applied for registration of
the trade mark “Marshal” for their use.
Having come to know of the said application
and perceiving a similarity between the
mark in respect of which registration was
sought by the appellants and the mark(s)
registered in favour of the respondent, the
respondent served a legal Notice dated
23.07.1982 asking the appellants to desist4
from using the mark in question, i.e.,
“Marshal”.
5.In the year 1989, the respondent
instituted a suit before the High Court of
Delhi  (Suit  No.  1612  of  1989)  for
infringement of trade mark, rendition of
accounts of profit earned by the appellants
from use of the mark “Marshal” and for
perpetual  injunction  to  restrain  the
appellants from using the trading styles
“Patel Field Marshal Agencies” and “Patel
Field Marshal Industries”. An Interlocutory
Application for temporary injunction was
also filed.
6.The defendants in the suit, i.e.,
the appellants herein, contested the claims
of the plaintiff-respondent on the ground
of jurisdiction as well as on merits. In
the  written  statement  filed,  the5
appellants-defendants also  contested the
validity  of  the  registration  of  the
respondent’s trade mark “Field Marshal” and
claimed that the same was liable to be
rectified in the trade mark register. An
issue to the said effect was framed in the
suit. 
7.The Delhi High Court by its Order
dated  28.09.1995  dismissed  the
Interlocutory  Application  filed  by  the
plaintiff-respondent for interim injunction
on the ground that the High Court did not
have  jurisdiction,  both,  pecuniary  and
territorial, over the subject matter. In
appeal, the Division Bench by Order dated
10.03.1998 reversed the decision of the
learned  single  Judge  and  directed  for
consideration  of  the  Interlocutory
Application  for  interim  injunction  on
merits. The matter was brought to this6
Court  in  Special  Leave  Petition  (C)
No.13512 of 1998. During the pendency of
the aforesaid S.L.P., in view of the remand
order  of  the  Division  Bench  dated
10.03.1998, a learned single Judge of the
High Court granted temporary injunction in
favour of the respondent-plaintiff. This
was on 07.07.1999. However, by a subsequent
Order dated 20.08.2008, the learned single
Judge of the High Court held that the court
had no jurisdiction and, therefore, ordered
for return of the plaint for presentation
before the competent court in the State of
Gujarat. The said order was challenged by
the respondents herein (plaintiffs in the
suit)  before  the  Division  Bench.  The
Division Bench by Order dated 24.10.2008
held that in the facts of the case the
plaint ought not to have been rejected;
however,  as  the  appellant  before  it7
(respondent-plaintiff) had no objection to
carry on the proceedings in the competent
court at Rajkot, Gujarat, the plaint  was
returned to be filed in Rajkot. Thereafter,
the case was transferred from the Delhi
High Court to the court at Rajkot and the
proceedings came to be numbered as Civil
Suit No. 1 of 2009 in the file of the
learned Additional District Judge, Rajkot.
8.While the aforesaid Order of the
Division Bench dated 24.10.2008 is the
subject  matter  of  challenge  in  the
connected  Civil  Appeal  arising  out  of
S.L.P. (C) No. 1851 of 2009 also filed by
the appellant, what is of significance is
that when the suit in question was pending
adjudication in the High Court of Delhi,
the appellants herein initiated parallel
proceedings  before  the  High  Court  of
Gujarat  (in  the  year  1997)  seeking8
rectification of the registration of the
trade mark(s) granted to the respondent.
Specifically,  the  appellants  had  filed
three rectification applications bearing RA
Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of 1997 under Sections
46/56 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks
Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the
“1958 Act”) for removal and cancellation of
the three trade marks registered in favour
of the petitioner bearing Nos. 224879,
252070 and 252071. The learned single Judge
of the High Court of Gujarat dismissed the
three applications in question by Order
dated 15.04.1998. The said order has been
affirmed in appeal by the Division Bench of
the Gujarat High Court by its Order dated
25.11.1998. This order has been subjected
to challenge in Civil Appeal Nos.4767-4769
of 2001 presently under consideration.9
9.While  the  reasoning  of  the
Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court  in
dismissing the applications in question
will be noticed in due course, the question
calling for an answer by this Court would
need  a  formulation  at  this  stage.  An
attempt at such formulation is being made
hereunder.
In  a  situation  where  a  suit  for
infringement  is  pending  wherein  the  issue  of
validity of the registration of the trade mark in
question has been raised either by the plaintiff
or  the  defendant  and  no  issue  on  the  said
question of validity has been framed in the suit
or  if  framed  has  not  been  pursued  by  the
concerned  party  in  the  suit  by  filing  an
application  to  the  High  Court  for  rectification
under  Sections  111  read  with  Section  107  of
the  Trade  and  Merchandise  Marks  Act,  1958,10
whether recourse to the remedy of rectification
under  Sections  46/56  of  the  1958  Act  would
still be available to contest the validity of  the
registration of the Trade mark. 
10.The  aforesaid  question  which
arises  in  the  present  appeals  in  the
context of the 1958 Act continues to be a
live issue in view of the  pari materia
provisions contained in the Trade Marks
Act, 1999, i.e., Sections 47, 57, 124 and
125  of  the  Trade  Marks  Act,  1999
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  1999
Act”).
11.The issues arising in Civil Appeal
Nos.4767-4769/2001  and  Civil  Appeals
arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.27309/2012  and
S.L.P.  (C)  No.30121/2012  are  same  and
similar. S.L.P. (C) No.30121/2012, however,
has since been withdrawn. 11
Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P.
(C) No.1851/2009 challenges the order passed
by the Delhi High Court on 24.10.2008 by which
the plaint was returned to be filed before the
competent  court  at  Rajkot,  despite  the
conclusion of the Appellate Bench that the
order of the learned Single Judge holding that
the Delhi High Court had no jurisdiction and
hence the plaint should be returned, is not
correct. As the said direction of the Division
Bench of the High Court challenged in the
appeal was at the instance of the plaintiff
(respondent herein), who was the appellant
before the High Court, we would understand the
stand taken to be a virtual withdrawal of the
appeal and an undertaking to comply with the
direction  of  the  learned  Single  Judge  to
present the plaint before the competent court
at Rajkot.  In these circumstances, we do not
consider it necessary to continue to entertain
the challenge made in the appeal arising out
of S.L.P. (C) No.1851/2009 so as examine the12
legality of the correctness of the said order
on merits. The person aggrieved before the
High Court i.e. the respondent herein chose to
comply with the order of the leaned Single
Judge. The appellant herein was not aggrieved
by the order of the learned Single Judge. The
aforesaid  proceeding  i.e.  arising  out  of
S.L.P. (C) No.1851/2009, in the circumstances
set out above, is accordingly closed.  Two
appeals,  therefore,  survive  for
consideration  i.e.  Civil  Appeal
Nos.4767-4769/2001 and Civil Appeal arising
out of S.L.P. (C) No.27309/2012.
12.We have heard Mr. Shailen Bhatia,
learned counsel for the appellants and
Mr. Harin P. Raval, learned senior counsel
for  the  respondents  in  Civil  Appeal
Nos.4767-4769 of 2001.  We have also heard
Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the
appellant and Mr. Gladys Daniels, learned13
counsel for the respondent in Civil Appeal
arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 27309 of
2012.
13.The arguments advanced on behalf
of the appellants in the appeals proceed on
the basis that Section 107 and 111 of the
1958 Act contemplates grant of permission
by the learned Trial Court for filing of a
rectification  application,  which
requirement, it is urged, does not seem to
follow from a reading of the aforesaid two
provisions of the 1958 Act. It is submitted
that under the 1958 Act, there are two
categories of right vested; the first in
the  owner  of  a  registered  trade  mark
(Sections 28 and 29) and the second in a
person  aggrieved  by  such  registration
(Sections 46 and 56). The aforesaid two
rights are parallel and independent of each
other.  It  is  submitted  that  the  only14
requirement  for  filing  a  rectification
application  under  the  provisions  of
Sections 107 and 111 of the 1958 Act is
that person filing such an application must
be a “person aggrieved” which would include
a  person  against  whom  an  infringement
action has been taken or is threatened by
the registered proprietor of the trade mark
as held by this Court in National Bell Co.
vs. Metal Goods Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. and
another1.  The  learned  counsel  for  the
appellants has also drawn attention of the
Court to the provisions of Section 32 of
the 1958 Act which gives conclusiveness to
the validity of the registered trade mark
after expiry of a period of seven years
from the date of registration except in
cases covered by sub-Clauses (a), (b) and
(c) of Section 32. It is contended that the
question of conclusiveness as to validity
1 (AIR) 1971 SC 89815
of the registration of the trade mark can
be raised in an infringement suit as also
in a rectification application. The very
requirement of permission of a subordinate
court (District Court) for filing of the
rectification application before a higher
Court (High Court), in the light of the
provisions of Section 107 and 111, cannot
be the legislative intent.  The provisions
of Section 41 (b) of the Specific Relief
Act, 1963 which restrains a subordinate
court  from  preventing  a  person  from
instituting any proceeding in a higher
court has also been stressed upon and
reliance has been placed in this regard on
Cotton Corporation of India Ltd. Vs. United
Industrial Bank Ltd. and Ors.2  Reliance
has also been placed on the decision of the
High Court of Madras in B. Mohamed Yousuff
Versus  Prabha  Singh  Jaswant  Singh  and
2 (1983) 4 SCC 62516
Others3 and the judgment of the Full Bench
of the Delhi High Court in Data Infosys
Limited  and  Others  Versus  Infosys
Technologies Limited4.
14.In  reply,  on  behalf  of  the
respondent,  it  is  contended  that  the
provisions of Section 111 of the 1958 Act
particularly  sub-sections  (3)  and  (4)
thereof make it very clear that once the
Civil Court is satisfied with regard to the
prima facie tenability of the issue of
invalidity of the registration of a trade
mark that may be raised before it by any
party to an infringement suit, the said
question  has  to  be  decided  in  a
rectification proceeding and not in the
suit. The suit will remain stayed and the
final decision of the statutory authority
in the rectification proceeding will govern
3 ( 2008) 38 PTC 576 Madras DB
4 2016 (65) PTC 209 Delhi FB17
the parties to the suit. It is contended on
behalf  of  the  respondents  that
rectification proceedings under Sections 46
and 56 of the 1958 Act govern a situation
where no suit for infringement is pending.
In  a  situation  where  a  suit  for
infringement  has  been  filed  and  the
question of validity of registration arises
therein and the Civil Court is satisfied as
to the prima facie tenability of the issue
of invalidity of the registration of the
trade mark, the provisions of Section 111
would take over and govern the proceedings
in  the  suit  including  the  issue  of
invalidity. It is further contended that
there is a deemed abandonment of the rights
conveyed under Sections 46 and 56 of the
1958  Act  in  the  event  a  suit  for
infringement  is  pending  wherein  the
question of invalidity has been raised and18
found to be prima facie tenable. It is
urged that the rights under Sections 46 and
56 on the one hand and those contained in
Sections 107 and 111 on the other must be
understood to be operating in two different
fields; both sets of provisions cannot
mutually exist as such mutual existence and
operation may lead to conflicting decisions
on the same question i.e. by the High Court
under the 1958 Act or by the IPAB under the
1999 Act on the one hand and the Civil
Court adjudicating the infringement suit on
the other. It is also submitted on behalf
of the respondents that the abandonment of
the plea of invalidity contemplated by
Section  111(3)  of  the  1958  Act  is  a
complete relinquishment for all practical
purposes and not only for the purpose of
the suit.  The abandonment contemplated by
Section 111 (3) of the 1958 Act does not19
keep alive the plea of invalidity to be
urged/agitated  separately  in  a
rectification  proceeding  under  Section
46/56 of the 1958 Act.  Insofar as the
decisions of the Madras High Court in B.
Mohamed Yousuff (supra) and the Delhi High
Court in Data Infosys Limited and Others
(supra)  are  concerned,  the  respondents
contend  that  the  ratio  of  the  said
judgments are not in consonance with the
true purport and effect of the legislative
scheme  and  therefore  this  Court  may
conclusively and authoritatively decide the
issue. 
15.Having  noticed  the  respective
contentions of the parties, we may now take
note of the relevant provisions of the 1958
Act, namely, Sections 46, 56, 107 and 111
which are reproduced below. 20
“46.  Removal  from  register  and
imposition  of  limitations  on  ground  of
non-use.
(1) Subject to the provisions of
section  47,  a  registered  trade
mark may be taken off the register
in respect of any of the goods in
respect of which it is registered
on  application  made  in  the
prescribed manner to a High Court
or to the Registrar by any person
aggrieved on the ground either—
(a) that  the  trade  mark  was
registered without any bona
fide intention on the part of
the applicant for registration
that it should be used in
relation to those goods by him
or, in a case to which the
provisions  of  section  45
apply,  by  the  company
concerned, and that there has,
in fact, been no bona fide use
of the trade mark in relation
to  those  goods  by  any
proprietor  thereof  for  the
time being up to a date one
month before the date of the
application; or
(b) that up to a date one month
before  the  date  of  the
application,  a  continuous
period of five years or longer
had elapsed during which the
trade mark was registered and
during which there was no bona
fide use thereof in relation21
to  those  goods  by  any
proprietor  thereof  for  the
time being:
Provided  that ,  except  where  the
applicant has been permitted under
sub-section (3) of section 12 to
register an identical or nearly
resembling trade mark in respect
of the goods in question or where
the tribunal is of opinion that he
might properly be permitted so to
register such a trade mark, the
tribunal may refuse an application
under clause (a) or clause (b) in
relation to any goods, if it is
shown that there has been, before
the relevant date or during the
relevant period, as the case may
be, bona fide use of the trade
mark by any proprietor thereof for
the  time  being  in  relation  to
goods  of  the  same  description,
being goods in respect of which
the trade mark is registered.
(2) Where in relation to any goods
in respect of which a trade mark
is registered—
(a) the circumstances referred to
in clause (b) of sub-section
(1) are shown to exist so far
as  regards  non-use  of  the
trade  mark  in  relation  to
goods to be sold, or otherwise
traded in, in a particular
place in India (otherwise than
for export from India), or in
relation  to  goods  to  be22
exported  to  a  particular
market outside India; and
(b) a person has been permitted
under  sub-  section  (3)  of
section  12  to  register  an
identical or nearly resembling
trade mark in respect of those
goods  under  a  registration
extending to use in relation
to goods under to be sold, or
otherwise traded in, or in
relation to goods to be so
exported, or the tribunal is
of  opinion  that  he  might
properly be permitted so to
register such a trade mark,
on application by that person in
the prescribed manner to a High
Court or to the Registrar, the
tribunal  may  impose  on  the
registration  of  the
first-mentioned  trade  mark  such
limitations as it thinks proper
for  securing  that  registration
shall cease to extend to such use.
(3) An  applicant  shall  not  be
entitled to rely for the purpose
of clause (b) of sub- section (1)
or  for  the  purposes  of  sub-
section (2) on any non- use of a
trade mark which is shown to have
been due to special circumstances
in  the  trade  and  not  to  any
intention to abandon or not to use
the trade mark in relation to the
goods  to  which  the  application
relates.23
xxx
56.  Power to cancel or vary registration
and to rectify the register.
(1) On  application  made  in  the
prescribed manner to a High Court
or to the Registrar by any person
aggrieved, the tribunal may make
such order as it may think fit for
cancelling  or  varying  the
registration of a trade mark on
the ground of any contravention,
or failure to observe a condition
entered  on  the  register  in
relation thereto.
(2) Any person aggrieved by the
absence  or  omission  from  the
register of any entry, or by any
entry made in the register without
sufficient cause, or by any entry
wrongly remaining on the register,
or by any error or defect in any
entry in the register, may apply
in the prescribed manner to a High
Court or to the Registrar, and the
tribunal may make such order for
making, expunging or varying the
entry as it may think fit.
(3) The  tribunal  may  in  any
proceeding  under  this  section
decide any question that may be
necessary or expedient to decide
in  connection  with  the
rectification of the register.24
(4) The  tribunal,  of  its  own
motion, may, after giving notice
in the prescribed manner to the
parties concerned and after giving
them  an  opportunity  of  being
heard, make any order referred to
in sub-section (1) or sub-section
(2).
(5) Any order of the High Court
rectifying  the  register  shall
direct  that  notice  of  the
rectification shall be served upon
the Registrar in the prescribed
manner who shall upon receipt of
such notice rectify the register
accordingly.
(6) The  power  to  rectify  the
register conferred by this section
shall include the power to remove
a trade mark registered in Part A
of the register to Part B of the
register.
Xxx
107.  Application  for  rectification  of
register  to  be  made  to  High  Court  in
certain cases.
(1) Where  in  a  suit  for
infringement of a registered trade
mark  the  validity  of  the
registration  of  the  plaintiff's
trade mark is questioned by the
defendant or where in any such
suit  the  defendant  raises  a
defence under clause (d) of sub-
section (1) of section 30 and the25
plaintiff questions the validity
of  the  registration  of  the
defendant's trade mark, the issue
as  to  the  validity  of  the
registration  of  the  trade  mark
concerned shall be determined only
on  an  application  for  the
rectification of the register, and
notwithstanding anything contained
in section 46, sub-section (4) of
section 47 or section 56, such
application shall be made to the
High  Court  and  not  to  the
Registrar.
(2) Subject to the provisions of
sub-section  (1),  where  an
application for rectification of
the  register  is  made  to  the
Registrar under section 46 or sub-
section  (4)  of  section  47  or
section 56, the Registrar may, if
he  thinks  fit,  refer  the
application at any stage of the
proceeding to the High Court.
Xxx
111.   Stay  of  proceedings  where  the
validity of registration of the trade mark
is questioned, etc.
(1) Where  in  any  suit  for  the
infringement of a trade mark—
(a) the defendant pleads that the
registration of the plaintiff'
s trade mark is invalid; or26
(b) the defendant raises a defence
under  clause  (d)  of  sub-
section (1) of section 30 and
the  plaintiff  pleads  the
invalidity of the registration
of the defendant's trade mark,
the  court  trying  the  suit
(hereinafter referred to as the
court), shall,--
(i) if  any  proceedings  for
rectification of the register
in relation to the plaintiff's
or defendant's trade mark are
pending before the Registrar
or the High Court, stay the
suit  pending  the  final
disposal of such proceedings;
(ii)if  no  such  proceedings  are
pending  and  the  court  is
satisfied  that  the  plea
regarding the invalidity of
the  registration  of  the
plaintiff's  or  defendant's
trade  mark  is  prima  facie
tenable,  raise  an  issue
regarding the same and adjourn
the case for a period of three
months from the date of the
framing of the issue in order
to enable the party concerned
to apply to the High Court for
rectification of the register.
(2) If the party concerned proves
to the court that he has made any
such application as is referred to
in clause (b) (ii) of sub-section
(1)  within  the  time  specified27
therein or within such extended
time  as  the  court  may  for
sufficient cause allow, the trial
of the suit shall stand stayed
until the final disposal of the
rectification proceedings.
(3) If  no  such  application  as
aforesaid has been made within the
time so specified or within such
extended time as the court may
allow,  the  issue  as  to  the
validity of the registration of
the trade mark concerned shall be
deemed to have been abandoned and
the court shall proceed with the
suit in regard to the other issues
in the case.
1851
(4) The final order made in any
rectification proceedings referred
to  in  sub-section  (1)  or
sub-section (2) shall be binding
upon the parties and the court
shall  dispose  of  the  suit
conformably to such order in so
far as it relates to the issue as
to  the  validity  of  the
registration of the trade mark.
(5) The stay of a suit for the
infringement of a trade mark under
this section shall not preclude
the court making any interlocutory
order  (including  any  order
granting an injunction, directing
accounts to be kept, appointing a
receiver  or  attaching  any
property), during the period of
the stay of the suit.”28
16.The aforesaid provisions of the
1958 Act have been replicated in the 1999
Act. As the judicial precedents that would
require elaboration are in the context of
the 1999 Act, for purpose of clarity, it
would suffice to indicate that Sections
46, 56, 111 and 107 of the 1958 Act
(extracted above) c orrespond to Sections
47, 57, 124 and 125 of the 1999 Act. 
17.What is the scheme of the Act? The
question  does  not  seem  to  have
received/engaged  the  attention  of  this
Court at any earlier point of time and
therefore will have to be answered by us.
The pronouncements of the High Court of
Delhi and Madras in Astrazeneca UK Ltd.
and  Anr.  Vs.  Orchid  Chemicals  and29
Pharmaceuticals  Ltd.5  and  B.  Mohamed
Yousuff (supra) and that of the Full Bench
of the Delhi High Court in Data Infosys
Limited (supra) have been cited at the Bar
in support of the respective contentions.
18.In Astrazeneca UK Ltd. (supra),
the Delhi High Court took the view that
while  in  cases  falling  under  Section
124(1)(i) of the 1999 Act, the Civil Court
in seisin of an infringement suit would be
obliged to adjourn the proceedings and
await the outcome of the rectification
proceedings,  in  cases  falling  under
Section  124(1)(ii),  access  to  the
Intellectual  Property  Appellate  Board
(earlier High Court) is barred if the
Civil Court does not find the plea of
invalidity  of  the  registration  of  the
Trade Mark, raised in the suit to be prima
5 2006 (32) PTC 73330
facie tenable. In such a situation, the
aggrieved party is left with the remedy of
approaching the Appellate Court insofar as
the finding with regard to absence of a
prima facie case with regard to the plea
of invalidity of the registration of the
trade mark is concerned.
19.However, the Madras High Court in
B.  Mohamed  Yousuff  (supra)   took  a
contrary view and held that Sections 124
(1)(i) and (ii) operate at two different
levels and in two different situations.
The former deals with a situation where a
rectification  application  is  already
pending  whereas  the  latter  governs  a
situation  where  no  such  proceeding  is
pending.  The Madras High Court was of the
view that both the sub-clauses focus their
field of operation only with regard to the
stay of civil suit for infringement and31
the same does not deal with the discretion
of the Court to permit or not to permit
the filing of a rectification application.
The High Court further was of the view
that a plain reading of Section 124(1)(ii)
does not disclose that the said provision
of the 1999 Act mandates a party to first
obtain permission/leave of the Court to
file a rectification application which is
a  statutory  right  vested  by  the  Act
(Sections 47 and 57 of the 1999 Act) and
therefore cannot be curtailed by any other
provision of the 1999 Act.
20.The issue arose once again before
the  Delhi  High  Court  in  Data  Infosys
Limited (supra) which was referred to a
Full Bench, perhaps, for a closer look
into the matter in view of the conflict of
opinions in Astrazeneca UK Ltd. (supra)
and B. Mohamed Yousuff (supra). After an32
elaborate consideration of the matter, the
Full  Bench  of  the  Delhi  High  Court
concluded that where registration of a
trade mark is questioned after initiation
of a suit for infringement it is open for
the  party  setting  up  the  plea  of
invalidity to apply to the IPAB under
Sections 47 and 57 of the 1999 Act for
rectification.  The High Court went on to
hold that the effect of the prima facie
evaluation of the tenability of the plea
of invalidity does not impinge on the
right of the party raising such a plea to
apply to the IPAB for rectification. In
other  words,  the  right  to  seek
rectification under Sections 47 and 57 of
the 1999 Act does not stand extinguished
in  a  situation  where  in  a  suit  for
infringement the plea of invalidity is
found to be prima facie  not tenable.  The33
only  difference  according  to  the  High
Court is that while under Sections 47 and
57 of the 1999 Act, the aggrieved party
can move the Registrar for rectification,
in the latter situation i.e. where a suit
is pending it is the IPAB which alone
acquires jurisdiction to the exclusion of
the Registrar.
21.In Data Infosys, the Full Bench of
the Delhi High Court further took the view
that the provisions of Section 124(3) of
the 1999 Act should be interpreted to mean
that if rectification proceedings are not
filed within the period stipulated under
Section 124(2) of the 1999 Act, or any
extended period, the issue of invalidity
of the registered trade mark would not
survive to be decided and the said plea
would be deemed to have been abandoned.
But all these consequences will follow in34
the suit.  If the aggrieved party files a
rectification application under Sections
47/57 of the 1999 Act after expiry of the
period stipulated under Section 124(2) of
the 1999 Act, or the extended period, as
may  be,  the  rectification  application
would still be maintainable and would have
to be decided on merits by the IPAB and
the final decision of the Board on the
rectification application would have no
bearing on the suit notwithstanding the
fact that the plea of invalidity is deemed
to have been abandoned therein.  The only
effect  of  the  belated  filing  of  the
rectification  proceeding  would  be  that
there  would  be  no  stay  of  the  suit.
According  to  the  Full  Bench,  the
jurisdiction  to  decide  disputes  with
regard to validity of registration of a
trade mark is exclusively vested in the35
statutory authorities i.e. the Registrar
or  the  IPAB  and  the  Civil  Court’s
jurisdiction to go into the merits of the
plea of invalidity is statutorily barred.
Therefore the jurisdiction of the IPAB
vested under the statute cannot be ousted
on the Civil Court’s determination of the
prima facie tenability of the plea of
invalidity or upon the failure of the
aggrieved party to move a rectification
application  within  the  time  stipulated
under Section 124(2) of the 1999 Act. 
22.Insofar as its earlier view in
Astrazeneca UK Ltd.  (supra) is concerned,
the Full Bench was of the opinion that the
appellate jurisdiction of the High Court
would only be confined to a consideration
of  the  question  of  the  prima  facie
assessment of tenability which would not
touch upon the question of invalidity of36
the  trade  mark  on  merits.   The  view
expressed in Astrazeneca UK Ltd. (supra)
was held to be unacceptable on that basis.
Insofar as the abandonment of the plea of
invalidity is concerned, the Full Bench
was of the opinion that Section 124(3)
merely  contemplates  abandonment  of  the
plea/defence of invalidity in the suit and
not an abandonment to claim rectification
under Sections 47/57 of the 1999 Act. 
23.Registration of a trade-mark vests
in the registered owner an exclusive right
to use the mark in relation to the goods
in respect of which the mark has been
registered. This is, however, subject to
such conditions and limitations as may be
incorporated in the registration itself.
It also grants to the registered owner a
right to seek and obtain relief in case of
infringement of the mark.  Section 46 in37
Chapter VI of the 1958 Act contemplates
removal  from  the  register  of  any
registered trade mark, inter alia, on the
ground  that  the  same  was  registered
without any  bona fide intention of use
and, in fact, such mark has not been used
up to one month prior to the date of the
application for removal or that for a
continuous period of five years there has
been  no  bona  fide  use  of  the  mark.
Chapter VII of the 1958 Act deals with
rectification  and  correction  of  the
register of trade marks.  Under Section
56, the Tribunal, (Registrar or, as the
case  may  be,  the  High  Court),  on
application,  may  cancel  or  vary  the
registration of a trade mark on the ground
of  any  contravention,  or  failure  to
observe  a  condition  subject  to  which
registration was granted. 38
24.In cases where in a suit for
infringement of a registered trade mark
the validity of the registration of the
trade mark is questioned either by the
plaintiff or by the defendant, Section
107 of the 1958 Act  provides that an
application for rectification shall be
made to the High Court and not to the
Registrar notwithstanding the provisions
contained in Section 46 or Section 56 of
the 1958 Act. This would seem to suggest
that in such cases (where a suit for
infringement is pending) the legislative
scheme is somewhat different.
25.The above seems to become more clear
from what is to be found in Section 111
of the 1958 Act which deals with “stay of
proceedings where the validity of registration of
the trade mark is questioned” .  The aforesaid39
provision of the 1958 Act specifically
provides  that  if  a  proceeding  for
rectification  of  the  register  in
relation to the trade mark of either the
plaintiff or the defendant is pending
before the Registrar or the High Court,
as may be, and a suit for infringement
is filed wherein the aforesaid plea is
raised either by the defendant or by the
plaintiff, the suit shall remain stayed.
Section  111  further  provides  if  no
proceedings  for  rectification  are
pending on the date of filing of the
suit and the issue of validity of the
registration of the plaintiff's or the
defendant's trade mark is raised/arises
subsequently and the same is prima facie
found to be  tenable, an issue to the
aforesaid effect shall be framed by the
Civil Court and the suit will remain40
stayed for a period of three months from
the date of framing of the issue so as
to enable the concerned party to apply
to the High Court for rectification of
the register. Section 111(2) of the 1958
Act provides that in case an application
for rectification is filed within the
time allowed the trial of the suit shall
remain  stayed.   Sub-Section  (3)  of
Section 111 provides that in the event
no such application for rectification is
filed despite the order passed by the
Civil Court, the plea with regard to
validity  of  the  registration  of  the
trade mark in question shall be deemed
to have been abandoned and the suit
shall proceed in respect of any other
issue that may have been raised therein.
Sub-section (4) of Section 111 provides
that the final order as may be passed in41
the rectification proceeding shall bind
the parties and the civil court will
dispose of the suit in conformity with
such order insofar as the issue with
regard to validity of the registration
of the trade mark is concerned. 
26.Following  well  accepted
principles  of  interpretation  of
statutes, which would hardly require a
reiteration, the heading of Section 111
of the 1958 Act i.e. “Stay  of  proceedings
where  the  validity  of  registration  of  the  trade
mark  is  questioned,  etc.” ,  cannot  be
understood to be determinative of the
true purport, intent and effect of the
provisions contained therein so as to
understand  the  said  section  to  be
contemplating only stay of proceedings
of  the  suit  where  validity  of  the42
registration  of  the  trade  mark  is
questioned. Naturally, the whole of the
provisions of the section will have to
be read and so read the same would
clearly show lack of any legislative
intent to limit/confine the operation of
the  section  to  what  its  title  may
convey. 
27.Rather, from the resume of the
provisions of the 1958 Act made above it
becomes clear that all questions with
regard to the validity of a Trade Mark
is  required  to  be  decided  by  the
Registrar or the High Court under the
1958 Act or by the Registrar or the IPAB
under the 1999 Act and not by the Civil
Court. The Civil Court, infact, is not
empowered by the Act to decide the said
question.  Furthermore, the Act mandates
that  the  decisions  rendered  by  the43
prescribed  statutory  authority
[Registrar/High Court ( now IPAB)] will
bind the Civil Court. At the same time,
the Act (both old and new) goes on to
provide a different procedure to govern
the exercise of the same jurisdiction in
two  different  situations.  In  a  case
where the issue of invalidity is raised
or arises independent of a suit, the
prescribed statutory authority will be
the sole authority to deal with the
matter. However, in a situation where a
suit  is  pending  (whether  instituted
before  or  after  the  filing  of  a
rectification application) the exercise
of  jurisdiction  by  the  prescribed
statutory authority is contingent on a
finding of the Civil Court as regards
the prima facie  tenability of the plea
of invalidity.44
28.Conversely, in a situation where
the Civil Court does not find a triable
issue on the plea of invalidity the
remedy of an aggrieved party would not
be to move under Sections 46/56 of the
1958 Act but to challenge the order of
the Civil Court in appeal. This would be
necessary to avoid multiple proceedings
on the same issue and resultant conflict
of decisions.
29.The 1958 Act clearly visualizes
that  though  in  both  situations  i.e.
where  no  suit  for  infringement  is
pending at the time of filing of the
application for rectification or such a
suit  has  came  to  be  instituted
subsequent  to  the  application  for
rectification, it is the Registrar or
the High Court which constitutes the
Tribunal to determine the question of45
invalidity, the procedure contemplated
by the Statute to govern the exercise of
jurisdiction  to  rectify  is,  however,
different  in  the  two  situations
enumerated. Such difference has already
been noted.
30.The intention of the legislature
is clear. All issues relating to and
connected  with  the  validity  of
registration has to be dealt with by the
Tribunal and not by the civil court.  In
cases  where  the  parties  have  not
approached the civil court, Sections 46
and 56 provide an independent statutory
right to an aggrieved party to seek
rectification of a trade mark.  However,
in  the  event  the  Civil  Court  is
approached,  inter  alia ,  raising  the
issue of invalidity of the trade mark46
such plea will be decided not by the
civil court but by the Tribunal under
the 1958 Act. The Tribunal will however
come into seisin of the matter only if
the Civil Court is satisfied that an
issue with regard to invalidity ought to
be framed in the suit.  Once an issue to
the said effect is framed, the matter
will have to go to the Tribunal and the
decision of the Tribunal will thereafter
bind the Civil Court.  If despite the
order of the civil court the parties do
not  approach  the  Tribunal  for
rectification, the plea with regard to
rectification will no longer survive.
31.The legislature while providing
consequences  for  non-compliance  with
timelines for doing of any act must be
understood  to  have  intended  such47
consequences to be mandatory in nature,
thereby, also affecting the substantive
rights  of  the  parties.  This  is  how
Section 111(3) of the 1958 Act has to be
understood. That apart, it is very much
within the legislative domain to create
legal  fictions  by  incorporating  a
deeming clause and the court will have
to understand such statutory fictions as
bringing about a real state of affairs
between  the  parties  and  ushering  in
legal consequences affecting the parties
unless, of course, there is any other
contrary provision in the statue. None
exists in the 1958 Act to understand the
provisions  of  Section  111(3)  in  any
other manner except that the right to
raise the issue of invalidity is lost
forever if the requisite action to move
the  High  Court/IPAB  (now)  is  not48
initiated  within  the  statutorily
prescribed time frame.
32.Thus, by virtue of the operation
of  the  1958  Act,  the  plea  of
rectification, upon abandonment, must be
understood to have ceased to exist or
survive between the parties  inter se.
Any other view would be to permit a
party to collaterally raise the issue of
rectification  at  any  stage
notwithstanding that a final decree may
have been passed by the civil court in
the meantime. True, the decree of the
Civil Court will be on the basis of the
conclusions on the other issues in the
suit.  But  to  permit  the  issue  of
rectification,  once  abandoned,  to  be
resurrected at the option of the party
who had chosen not to pursue the same at
an earlier point of time would be to49
open  the  doors  to  reopening  of
decrees/orders  that  have  attained
finality in law.  This will bring in
uncertainty if not chaos in the judicial
determinations between the parties that
stand  concluded.  Besides,  such  an
interpretation would permit an aggrieved
party to get over the operation of a
statute providing for deemed abandonment
of the right to raise an issue relevant;
in fact, fundamental to the lis. The
position may be highlighted by reference
to a suit for infringement where the
defendant raises the plea of invalidity
of the plaintiff's trade mark and also
in the alternative takes up any of the
defenses available in law. The defendant
by operation of Section 111(3) of the
1958 Act is deemed to have abandoned the
plea of invalidity. In the trial it is50
found that the defendant is guilty of
infringement  and  is  appropriately
restrained by a decree of the Civil
Court.  If the right under Section 46/56
of the 1958 Act is to subsist even in
such  a  situation,  the  possible
uncertainty  and  possible  anarchy  may
well be visualized. This is why the
legislature by enacting Section 111 of
the 1958 Act has mandated that the issue
of invalidity which would go to the root
of the matter should be decided in the
first instance and a decision on the
same would bind the parties before the
civil  court.  Only  if  the  same  is
abandoned or decided against the party
raising it that the suit will proceed in
respect of the other issues, if any.  If
the above is the legislative intent,
which seems to be clear, we do not see51
how the same can be overcome by reading
the rights under Sections 46 and 56 of
the  1958  Act  to  exist  even  in  a
situation where the  abandonment of the
same  right  under  Section  111(3)  has
taken effect in law.  The mandate of the
1958  Act,  particularly,  Section  111
thereof,  appears  to  be  that  if  an
aggrieved party does not approach the
Tribunal for a decision on the issue of
invalidity of registration as provided
for under Section 111(2) and (3), the
right to raise the issue (of invalidity)
would  no  longer  survive  between  the
parties to enable the concerned party to
seek enforcement of the same by recourse
to or by a separate action under the
provisions of Section 46/56 of the 1958
Act.  52
33.Having dealt with the matter in
the above manner, certain subsidiary and
incidental questions, urged and argued
by  the  parties,  would  also  need  an
answer.
34.The first question posed is how
an approach to the superior Court i.e.
the High Court, under Section 111 of the
1958  Act,  can  be  contingent  on  a
permission or grant of leave by a court
of subordinate jurisdiction. The above
is also contended to be plainly contrary
to the provisions of Section 41 (b) of
Specific Relief Act, 1963.  It is also
urged that Section 32 of the 1958 Act
provides  a  defence  to  a  claim  of
infringement which is open to be taken
both in a proceeding for rectification
as well as in a suit.  The said defence
statutorily available to a contesting53
party cannot be foreclosed by a deemed
abandonment of the issue of invalidity,
it has been contended. 
35.Section 111 of the 1958 Act and
the  corresponding Section 124 of the
1999 Act nowhere contemplates grant of
permission by the civil court to move
the High Court or the IPAB, as may be,
for rectification. The true purport and
effect of Sections 111/124 (of the old
and  new  Act)  has  been  dealt  within
detail and would not require any further
discussion  or  enumeration.  The
requirement of satisfaction of the civil
Court regarding the existence of a prima
facie case of invalidity and the framing
of an issue to that effect before the
law operates to vest jurisdiction in the
statutory authority to deal with the
issue  of  invalidity  by  no  means,54
tantamount to permission or leave of the
civil court, as has been contended. It
is a basic requirement to further the
cause  of  justice  by  elimination  of
false, frivolous and untenable claims of
invalidity that may be raised in the
suit.
36.While Section 32 of the 1958
Act,  undoubtedly,  provides  a  defence
with  regard  to  the  finality  of  a
registration by efflux of time, we do
not see how the provisions of aforesaid
section can be construed to understand
that the proceedings under Sections 46
and 56 on the one hand and those under
Sections 107 and 111 on the other of the
1958 Act and the pari materia  provisions
of the 1999 Act  would run parallelly.
As already held by us, the jurisdiction
of rectification conferred by Sections55
46 and 56 of the 1958 Act is the very
same  jurisdiction  that  is  to  be
exercised under Sections 107 and 111 of
the  1958  Act  when  the  issue  of
invalidity is raised in the suit but by
observance of two different procedural
regimes.
37.In the light of the above while
answering the question arising in the
manner indicated above, we dismiss all
the  appeals  under  consideration  and
affirm the order passed by the High
Courts.

REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
CRIMINAL APPEAL Nos. 1492­1493 OF 2010
GURJIT SINGH                                        ....APPELLANT(S)  
                                 VERSUS
STATE OF PUNJAB                                .... RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T  
B.R. GAVAI, J.
1.These appeals by special leave challenge the judgment
and order dated 20.2.2009 passed by the Division Bench of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 544­
DBA of 2001 and Criminal Appeal No. 959­SB of 2000. All the
four accused, including the appellant herein (accused No.3),
who is husband of the deceased, were charged and tried by the
learned trial Court for the offence punishable under Section
304­B   and   Section   498­A   of   the   Indian   Penal   Code,   1860
(hereinafter referred to as “IPC”).   The other accused were the
father (accused No.1), the mother (accused No.2) and the sister­
in­law (wife of brother) (accused No.4) of the appellant. The2
Additional   Sessions   Judge,   Hoshiarpur,   held   that   the
prosecution had  succeeded in proving the  case against accused
Nos. 1  to 3 for the offence punishable under Section 498­A of
the IPC but has failed to prove the case against the said accused
(Nos. 1, 2 and 3) for the offence punishable under  Section 304­
B of the IPC.  Insofar as accused No. 4 is concerned, it was held
that the prosecution has failed to prove the case against her for
both   the   offences   and   she   was   accordingly   acquitted   of   the
offence   charged.   The   trial   Judge,   therefore,   convicted   the
appellant and his father and mother for the offence punishable
under Section 498­A of the IPC and sentenced them to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a
fine of   Rs. 4000/­ each and, in default of payment of fine, to
further undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three
months.   
2.       Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence under
Section 498­A of the IPC, the appellant along with his parents
preferred an appeal (being Criminal Appeal No.959­SB of 2000)
before the High Court. So also, the State preferred an appeal
(being Criminal Appeal No.544­DBA of 2001),  being aggrieved by
that part of the order by which the trial Court acquitted accused
No. 4 and also acquitted accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for the offence3
punishable under Section 304­B of the IPC.    The High Court
upheld the conviction of accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for the offence
punishable under Section 498­A of the IPC. It also upheld the
acquittal of accused No. 4 and further held that, though the
prosecution could not bring the case under Section 304­B of the
IPC, the appellant herein was liable to be  punished for the
offence punishable under Section 306 of the IPC.   The High
court maintained the order of the sentence and fine as recorded
by the trial Judge for the offence punishable under Section 498­
A of the IPC. For the offence under Section 306 of the IPC, the
High Court sentenced the appellant herein to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.
5000/­ and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo
rigorous   imprisonment   for   a   period   of   five   months.   Being
aggrieved   thereby,   the   present   appeals   are   preferred   by   the
appellant.
3.         Shri Rajeshwar Singh Thakur, learned counsel for the
appellant,   submitted   that   the   conviction   as   recorded   by  the
learned   trial   court   and   confirmed   by   the   High   Court   under
Section 498­A of the IPC is not tenable. It is submitted, that the
conviction is only on the basis of the evidence of PW­10 ­ Bishan
Singh, the father of the deceased. It is submitted, that there is4
no corroboration to the said evidence. It is submitted, that in
any case, the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC is not
tenable. It is contended that the charge was for the offence
punishable under Section 304­B of the IPC, the ingredients of
which are totally different than the ingredients of Section 306 of
the IPC. It is submitted that as such grave prejudice was caused
to the appellant. It is further submitted that the evidence shows
that the father of the deceased, PW­10, has stated, that even
during the course of the trial, the appellant was on congenial
meeting terms with the father of the deceased  and as such the
unnatural human conduct would discredit his testimony.
4.Per   contra,   Smt.   Jaspreet   Gogia,   learned   counsel
appearing  on   behalf  of  the   State,   submitted   that  insofar  as
conviction under Section 498­A of the IPC is concerned, since
there is a concurrent finding, no interference is warranted. She
further submitted, that since the ingredients of Section 304­B
and Section 306 of the IPC are almost similar, no prejudice was
caused to the appellant by convicting him under Section 306 of
the   IPC   though   no   charge   was   framed   for   the   same.   It   is
submitted   that   all   the   ingredients   necessary   for   conviction
under Section 306 with the aid of Section 113­A of the Indian5
Evidence Act, 1872 were duly proved by the prosecution and as
such no interference is warranted in the present appeals.
5.The perusal of the record would reveal that though the
appellant has disputed the date of marriage to be 04.02.1989,
both   the   courts   have   disbelieved   him   and   rightly   so.   The
deceased died an unnatural death on 28.09.1994 by consuming
poison. As such, the unnatural death occurred within a period
of seven years of the marriage. The learned trial Judge has
acquitted the appellant for the offence punishable under Section
304­B of  the IPC since the prosecution has failed to prove the
demand for dowry, while convicting him along with the parents
for the offence punishable under Section 498­A of the IPC. The
High Court maintained the conviction under Section 498­A of
the IPC, however, it also convicted the appellant for the offence
punishable under Section 306 of the IPC with the aid of Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  
6.The question that we are called upon to answer is as to
whether the conviction as confirmed by the High Court under
Section 498­A of the IPC and as recorded by it for the first time
under Section 306 of the IPC would be sustainable or not. 6
7.The   relevant   provisions   of   the   IPC   that   fall   for
consideration are as under: 
“107. Abetment of a thing  ­ A person abets the doing of
a thing, who—
First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or
Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or
persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if
an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
Thirdly.—Intentionally   aids,   by   any   act   or   illegal
omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation   1 .—A   person   who,   by   wilful
misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material
fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or
procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be
done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of
the   commission   of   an   act,   does   anything   in   order   to
facilitate   the   commission   of   that   act,   and   thereby
facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing
of that act.
xxx
306. Abetment   of   suicide .—If   any   person   commits
suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide,
shall   be   punished   with   imprisonment   of   either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
xxx
498­A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman
subjecting   her   to   cruelty .—   Whoever,   being   the
husband  or   the  relative   of   the   husband   of   a   woman,
subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years
and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.—For the
purposes of this section, “cruelty” means— (a) any wilful
conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the
woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or
danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical)7
of the woman; or (b) harassment of the woman where
such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any
person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for
any property or valuable security or is on account of
failure by her or any person related to her to meet such
demand.”
8.The relevant provision of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
that also requires consideration is as follows:
“113­A.   Presumption as to abetment of suicide
by   a   married   woman.  ­­When   the   question   is
whether the commission of suicide by a woman had
been abetted by her husband or any relative of her
husband and it is shown that she had committed
suicide within a period of seven years from the date
of   her   marriage   and   that   her   husband   or   such
relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty,
the   court   may   presume,   having   regard   to   all   the
other circumstances of the case, that such suicide
had been abetted by her husband or by such relative
of her husband.
Explanation.  ­­ For the purposes of this section,
""cruelty"" shall have the same meaning as in section
498A of the IPC (45 of 1860).]”
9.The perusal of the evidence of PW­10 ­ Bishan Singh, the
father   of   the   deceased,   would   establish   that   the   deceased,
Jaswinder Kaur was married to appellant on 04.02.1989. His
daughter had two issues. The elder one was four years old and
the son was about 1  ½  years old at the time of the occurrence.
He stated, that after the marriage, accused were harassing his
daughter for giving less dowry. In the year 1992, he had given
one steel almirah to his daughter but the accused were not8
satisfied   with   the   dowry   article.   In   March   1993,   he   had
purchased one fridge through his son­in­law, Jagtar Singh, from
the Military Canteen for Rs. 6,600/­, which was given to the
accused persons.  Even then the accused were not satisfied. The
accused were pressing his daughter, Jaswinder Kaur, to bring
Rs.   50,000/­   from   her   parents.   He   further   stated,   that   the
accused were compelling his daughter out of anger to bring
Rs.   50,000/­,   in   cash,   as   they   were   to   purchase   a   plot   at
Hoshiarpur. He further stated that on two­three occasions, his
daughter came to his Village Kharal Kalan and he requested her
that Rs. 50,000/­ were not with him at that stage and after
selling the paddy crop he can pay that amount. He stated that,
thereafter,   after   consoling   his   daughter,   he   sent   her   to   her
in­laws house. He further stated, that on 28.09.1994 when he
was in his house, he came to know that his daughter had died.
Suspecting that his daughter was given poison or she consumed
poison, he lodged a report with the police. 
10.To some extent, the evidence of PW­10 is corroborated by
the evidence of PW­13 ­ Iqbal Singh.  He has stated, that prior
to the occurrence, i.e., the death of the deceased there was a
dispute   between   the   accused   persons   and   the   deceased,
Jaswinder Kaur, as Rs. 50,000/­ was being demanded by the9
accused   persons   from   the   parents   of   the   deceased   for
purchasing a plot. He further stated, that the parents of the
deceased could not pay Rs. 50,000/­ and promised to pay the
same after selling paddy crop. He further stated, that before
demand of Rs. 50,000/­, one refrigerator and one almirah was
given to the accused persons by the parents of the deceased on
their demand  and this was over and above dowry given at the
time of the marriage.
11. Thus from the evidence of PW­10 which is corroborated
to an extent by PW­13, we have no hesitation to hold that the
prosecution has proved that the deceased was harassed with a
view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any
unlawful demand  for any property or valuable security or such a
harassment was on account of failure by her or any person
related to her to meet such a demand.   We   find, that on the
basis   of   aforesaid   evidence,   the   prosecution   has   proved   the
charge under Explanation (b) of Section 498­A of the IPC.  
12.Now the question that would fall for consideration is as to
whether   when   the   prosecution   establishes   cruelty   under
Explanation (b) of Section 498­A of the IPC and also establishes
that the deceased committed suicide within seven years of the
marriage, could the accused be also held guilty for the offence10
punishable under Section 306 of the IPC with the aid of Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act. 
13.The said question fell for consideration before the bench
of three learned Judges of this Court in the case of   Ramesh
Kumar  vs.    State   of   Chhattisgarh1.    This   Court,   after
reproducing the provisions of Section 306 of the IPC and Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 observed thus:  
“12. This   provision   was   introduced   by   the
Criminal Law (Second) Amendment Act, 1983 with
effect from 26­12­1983 to meet a social demand to
resolve difficulty of proof where helpless married
women were eliminated by being forced to commit
suicide   by   the   husband   or   in­laws   and
incriminating   evidence   was   usually   available
within the four corners of the matrimonial home
and hence was not available to anyone outside the
occupants of the house.  However, still it cannot be
lost sight of that the presumption is intended to
operate against the accused in the field of criminal
law. Before the presumption may be raised, the
foundation thereof must exist. A bare reading of
Section 113­A shows that to attract applicability of
Section   113­A,   it   must   be   shown   that   (i)   the
woman has committed suicide, (ii) such suicide
has been committed within a period of seven years
from the date of her marriage, (iii) the husband or
his relatives, who are charged had subjected her
to   cruelty.  On   existence   and   availability   of   the
abovesaid   circumstances,   the   court  may
presume that such suicide had been abetted by
her husband or by such relatives of her husband.
Parliament has chosen to sound a note of caution.
Firstly, the presumption is not mandatory; it is
only permissive as the employment of expression
“may presume” suggests. Secondly, the existence
1 (2001) 9 SCC 61811
and   availability   of   the   abovesaid   three
circumstances shall not, like a formula, enable the
presumption being drawn; before the presumption
may be drawn the court shall have to have regard
to   “all   the   other   circumstances   of   the   case”.   A
consideration of all the other circumstances of the
case   may   strengthen   the   presumption   or   may
dictate the conscience of the court to abstain from
drawing the presumption. The expression — “the
other circumstances of the case” used in Section
113­A suggests the need to reach a cause­and­
effect   relationship   between   the   cruelty   and   the
suicide for the purpose of raising a presumption.
Last but not the least, the presumption is not an
irrebuttable one. In spite of a presumption having
been raised the evidence adduced in defence or
the facts and circumstances otherwise available
on   record   may   destroy   the   presumption.   The
phrase “may presume” used in Section 113­A is
defined in Section 4 of the Evidence Act, which
says — “Whenever it is provided by this Act that
the court may presume a fact, it may either regard
such   fact   as   proved,   unless   and   until   it   is
disproved, or may call for proof of it.
13. The present case is not one which may fall
under clauses  secondly and thirdly of Section 107
of   the   Penal   Code,   1860.   The   case   has   to   be
decided by reference to the first clause i.e. whether
the   accused­appellant   abetted   the   suicide   by
instigating her to do so.”       
                              (emphasis supplied)
14.It could thus be seen, that this Court has observed that
to   attract   the   applicability   of   Section   113­A   of   the   Indian
Evidence   Act,   the   following   conditions   are   required   to   be
satisfied:
(i) The woman has committed suicide,12
(ii)Such suicide has been committed within a period of  
seven years from the date of her marriage,
(iii) The husband or his relatives, who are charged had 
subjected her to cruelty.
15.This Court further observed that on the existence and
availability   of   the   aforesaid   circumstances,   the   court   may
presume that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or
by such relatives of her husband. It has been held that the
presumption   is   not   mandatory;   but   only   permissive   as   the
words “may presume” suggests.  It has further been held that
the   existence   and   availability   of   the   aforesaid   three
circumstances shall not, like a formula, enable the presumption
being drawn.  It has been held that before a presumption being
drawn, the court shall have regard to all other circumstances of
the case. It has been held, that the consideration of all the other
circumstances of the case may strengthen the presumption or
may dictate the conscience of the court to abstain from drawing
the presumption. It thus observed that the expression “the other
circumstances of the case” used in  Section 113­A of the Indian
Evidence   Act   suggests   the   need   to   reach   a   cause­and­effect
relationship between the cruelty and the suicide for the purpose
of raising a presumption. 13
16.It has been further held that when the case does not fall
under clauses secondly and thirdly of Section 107 of the IPC,
the case is to be decided with reference to the first clause, i.e.,
whether   the   accused­appellant   abetted   the   suicide   by
instigating her to do so. It will be further relevant to refer to
following observations in  Ramesh Kumar  (supra):
“20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke,
incite or encourage to do “an act”. To satisfy the
requirement of instigation though it is not necessary
that actual words must be used to that effect or what
constitutes   instigation   must   necessarily   and
specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a
reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must
be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not
a   case   where   the   accused   had   by   his   acts   or
omission   or   by   a   continued   course   of   conduct
created such circumstances that the deceased was
left with no other option except to commit suicide in
which case an instigation may have been inferred. A
word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without
intending the consequences to actually follow cannot
be said to be instigation.
21. In State   of   W.B.  v. Orilal   Jaiswal,   (1994)   1
SCC 73, this  Court has  cautioned  that the court
should be extremely careful in assessing the facts
and circumstances of each case and the evidence
adduced   in   the   trial   for   the   purpose   of   finding
whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in
fact   induced   her   to   end   her   life   by   committing
suicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim
committing  suicide   was   hypersensitive   to   ordinary
petulance, discord and differences in domestic life
quite   common   to   the   society   to   which   the   victim
belonged   and   such   petulance,   discord   and
differences were not expected to induce a similarly
circumstanced   individual   in   a   given   society   to
commit suicide, the conscience of the court should14
not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused
charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be
found guilty.
22. Sections   498­A   and   306   IPC   are   independent
and constitute different offences.  Though, depending
on the facts and circumstances of an individual case,
subjecting a woman to cruelty may amount to an
offence   under   Section   498­A   and   may   also,   if   a
course   of   conduct   amounting   to   cruelty   is
established leaving no other option for the woman
except to  commit suicide, amount to abetment to
commit   suicide.   However,   merely   because   an
accused has been held liable to be punished under
Section 498­A IPC it does not follow that on the same
evidence he must also and necessarily be held guilty
of having abetted the commission of suicide by the
woman concerned …..”
(emphasis supplied)
 
17.The   Court   observed   that   instigation   is   to   goad,   urge
forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do “an act”.   Though
the court observed that to satisfy the requirement of instigation,
it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect
or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically
be   suggestive   of   the   consequence.   However,   it   has   been
observed that a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence
must be capable of being spelt out.  Relying on the judgment of
this court in the case of  State of West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal2,
it is observed that the court should be extremely careful in
assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the
2 (1994) 1 SCC 7315
evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether
the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to
end her life by committing suicide.  It has further been held that
Section 498­A and Section 306 of the IPC are independent and
constitute   different   offences.   It   has   been   observed,   that
depending on the facts and circumstances of an individual case,
subjecting a woman to cruelty may amount to an offence under
Section 498­A of the IPC. It has further been observed, that if a
course of conduct amounting to cruelty is established leaving no
other option for the woman except to commit suicide, it may
also   amount   to   abetment   to   commit   suicide.   It   is   further
observed, that, however, merely because accused had been held
liable to be punished under Section 498­A of the IPC, it does not
follow that on the same evidence he must also and necessarily
be held guilty of having abetted the commission of suicide by
the woman concerned. 
18.Another three­Judge bench of this Court in the case of  K.
Prema S. Rao and Anr .   vs. Yadla Srinivasa Rao and Ors .3
had an occasion to consider the question as to whether in the
circumstances of framing  charge only under Section 304­B of
the IPC and not framing the one under Section 306 of the IPC,
could the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC read with
3 (2003) 1 SCC 21716
Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act be tenable?    In the
said   case,   the   Court   found   that   the   charge   specifically
mentioned as under.
“That on or about the 22nd day of October, 1989, at your
house at Tunikipadu of Gampalagudem Mandal, Yedla
Krishna Kumari, wife of A­1 among you and daughter­in­
law of A­2 and A­3 among you, committed suicide by
consuming poison, and that you all subjected her to such
cruelty   and   harassment  as   did   drive   her   to   commit
suicide, with the object of extracting ac. 5.00 of land as
dowry   to   A­1   and   thereby   committed   an   offence
punishable   under   Section   304­B   of   the   Indian   Penal
Code, 1860 and within the cognizance of this court.
or alternatively
That, prior to the 22nd day of October, 1989, at your
house   at   Tunikipadu,   you   subjected   Yedla   Krishna
Kumari, wife of A­1 among you and daughter­in­law of A­
2 and A­3 among you,  to such cruelty and harassment as
did drive the said Krishna Kumari to commit suicide , and
thereby committed an offence punishable under Section
498­A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and within the
cognizance of this court.”
19.The   court,   therefore,   held   that   the   ingredients   to
constitute an offence under Section 306 of the IPC were already
found in the charge and as such no prejudice was caused to the
accused therein, though no separate charge was framed under
Section 306 of the IPC.  Apart from that, the evidence on record
established that when the letters concealed by the husband
were discovered by the wife and handed over to the father and
she was driven out of the house, this cruel  conduct of the
husband led the wife to commit suicide. It could thus be seen,
that in the facts of the said case, the C ourt found that the17
conviction under Section 306 of the IPC could be recorded. It
was found that, apart from the earlier acts of harassment for
parting with the land which she had received in marriage as
stridhana, there was an act of driving the deceased out of the
house which had direct nexus with the deceased committing
suicide.
20. The bench of two Judges of this Court had an occasion
to consider a similar issue in the case of  Hans Raj vs. State of
Haryana4. It will be relevant to refer to following paragraphs: 
“12.   The question then arises as to whether in the
facts and circumstances of the case the appellant can be
convicted of the offence under Section 306 IPC with the
aid of the presumption under Section 113­A of the Indian
Evidence Act. Any person who abets the commission of
suicide is liable to be punished under Section 306 IPC.
Section 107 IPC lays down the ingredients of abetment
which includes instigating any person to do a thing or
engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for
the doing of a thing, if an act or illegal omission takes
place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the
doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal
omission to the doing of that thing. In the instant case
there is no direct evidence to establish that the appellant
either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide
or entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing
suicide. In the absence of direct evidence the prosecution
has relied upon Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act
under   which   the   court   may   presume   on   proof   of
circumstances enumerated therein, and having regard to
all the other circumstances of the case, that the suicide
had  been  abetted  by the  accused.  The  explanation  to
Section 113­A further clarifies that cruelty shall have the
same meaning as in Section 498­A of the Indian Penal
Code…...
4 (2004) 12 SCC 25718
13. Unlike Section 113­B of the Indian Evidence Act,
a statutory presumption does not arise by operation of
law merely on proof of the circumstances enumerated in
Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act. Under Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, the prosecution has
first to establish that the woman concerned committed
suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her
marriage   and   that   her   husband   (in   this   case)   had
subjected   her   to   cruelty.   Even   if   these   facts   are
established the court is not bound to presume that the
suicide had been abetted by her husband. Section 113­A
gives   a   discretion   to   the   court   to   raise   such   a
presumption,   having   regard   to   all   the   other
circumstances of the case, which means that where the
allegation is of cruelty it must consider the nature of
cruelty to which the woman was subjected, having regard
to the meaning of the word “cruelty” in Section 498­A
IPC.   The   mere   fact   that   a   woman   committed   suicide
within seven years of her marriage and that she had been
subjected   to   cruelty   by   her   husband,   does   not
automatically   give   rise   to   the   presumption   that   the
suicide had been abetted by her husband. The court is
required to look into all the other circumstances of the
case.   One   of   the   circumstances   which   has   to   be
considered by the court is whether the alleged cruelty
was of such nature as was likely to drive the woman to
commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life,
limb or health of the woman……”
 
21.  The court found that in the case there was no direct
evidence   to   establish   that   the   appellant   either   aided   or
instigated the deceased to commit suicide or entered into any
conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide. It has been held
that when  the  allegation  is   of  cruelty,  it  must consider the
nature of cruelty to which the woman was subjected having
regard to the meaning of the word “cruelty” in Section 498­A of
IPC. It has been held that one of the circumstances which has19
to   be   taken   into   consideration   by   the   court   is   whether   the
alleged cruelty was of such a nature as was likely to drive the
woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to
life, limb or health of the woman. 
22.This   court   in   the   case   of   Hans Raj (supra)   has   also
referred to the judgment of this court in the case of   State of
West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal  (supra), wherein it is observed
that the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not
stand altered even after the introduction of Section 498­A of the
IPC and Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act. 
23.It will be relevant to refer to the following observations
of this Court in the case of   Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal    vs.
State of Gujarat5 : 
“26. Section 113­A only deals with a presumption
which the court may draw in a particular fact situation
which may arise when necessary ingredients in order to
attract   that   provision   are   established.   Criminal   law
amendment and the rule of procedure was necessitated
so as to meet the social challenge of saving the married
woman from being ill­treated or forcing to commit suicide
by   the   husband   or   his   relatives,   demanding   dowry.
Legislative mandate of the section is that when a woman
commits suicide within seven years of her marriage and it
is shown that her husband or any relative of her husband
had subjected her to cruelty as per the terms defined in
Section 498­A IPC, the court may presume having regard
to all other circumstances of the case that such suicide
has   been   abetted   by   the   husband   or   such   person.
Though a presumption could be drawn, the burden of
proof   of   showing   that   such   an   offence   has   been
5 (2013) 10 SCC 4820
committed by the accused under Section 498­A IPC is on
the prosecution. On facts, we have already found that the
prosecution has not discharged the burden that A­1 had
instigated, conspired or intentionally aided so as to drive
the wife to commit suicide or that the alleged extramarital
affair was of such a degree which was likely to drive the
wife to commit suicide.
27. Section 306 refers to abetment of suicide. It says
that if any person commits suicide, whoever abets the
commission   of   such   suicide,   shall   be   punished   with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years
and shall also be liable to fine. The action for committing
suicide is also on account of mental disturbance caused
by mental and physical cruelty. To constitute an offence
under Section 306, the prosecution has to establish that
a   person   has   committed   suicide   and   the   suicide   was
abetted by the accused. The prosecution has to establish
beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased committed
suicide   and   the   accused   abetted   the   commission   of
suicide.   But   for   the   alleged   extramarital   relationship,
which if proved, could be illegal and immoral, nothing
has been brought out by the prosecution to show that the
accused  had  provoked,  incited  or induced  the  wife  to
commit suicide. ”
24.It has thus been observed that though presumption could
be drawn, the burden of proof of showing that such an offence
has been committed by the accused is on the prosecution. The
prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused had instigated, conspired or intentionally aided so as to
drive the wife to commit suicide.
25.In  Mangat   Ram   vs.  State   of   Haryana6  this   Court
observed thus:
“28. We have already indicated that the trial court
has found that no offence under Section 304­B IPC has
6 (2014) 12 SCC 59521
been made out against the accused, but it convicted the
accused under Section 306 IPC, even though no charge
had been framed on that section against the accused.
The scope and ambit of Section 306 IPC has not been
properly appreciated by the courts below. ……….. 
Abetment of suicide is confined to the case of persons
who aid or abet the commission of the suicide. In the
matter of an offence under Section 306 IPC, abetment
must attract the definition thereof in Section 107 IPC.
Abetment   is   constituted   by   instigating   a   person   to
commit an offence or engaging in a conspiracy to commit,
aid or intentional aiding a person to commit it. It would
be evident from a plain reading of Section 306 read with
Section 107 IPC that, in order to make out the offence of
abetment or suicide, necessary proof required is that the
culprit is either instigating the victim to commit suicide
or has engaged himself in a conspiracy with others for
the commission of suicide, or has intentionally aided by
an act or illegal omission in the commission of suicide. ”
26.After observing the aforesaid, this Court, relying on the
judgment   of   this   Court   in   the   case   of   Hans   Raj  (supra),
observed that even if it is established that the woman concerned
had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the
date of marriage and that her husband has subjected her to
cruelty, the court is not bound to presume that suicide has
been   abetted   by   her   husband.   It   is   required   to   take   into
consideration all other circumstances of the case.
27.It   could   thus   be   seen,   that   the   view   taken   by   the
three­Judge Bench of this Court in the case of  Ramesh Kumar
(supra)  that when a case does not fall under clause secondly or
thirdly, it has to be decided with reference to the first clause,22
i.e., whether the accused has abetted the commission of suicide
by intentionally instigating her to do so; has been consistently
followed. As such, we are of the view that merely because an
accused is found guilty of an offence punishable under Section
498­A of the IPC and the death has occurred within a period of
seven   years   of   the   marriage,   the   accused   cannot   be
automatically   held   guilty   for   the   offence   punishable   under
Section 306 of the IPC by employing the presumption under
Section   113­A   of   the   Evidence   Act.   Unless   the   prosecution
establishes that some act or illegal omission by the accused has
driven the deceased to commit the suicide, the conviction under
Section 306 would not be tenable.
28.Insofar as the judgment of this Court in   K. Prema S.
Rao (supra), on which the High Court had relied, is concerned,
we have already discussed hereinabove that in the said case
there was evidence on record proving that immediately prior to
committing   the   suicide   the   deceased   was   driven   out   of   the
house. As such, it was held that the said cruelty would amount
to abetment to commit suicide.
29.Insofar   as   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in   Modinsab
Kasimsab Kanchagar    vs.   State of Karnataka & Anr.7  is
concerned, no doubt that the learned counsel for the State is
7 (2013) 4 SCC 55123
justified in relying on the said judgment as the conviction in the
said case is for the offence punishable under Section 498­A of
the IPC and Sections 3, 4 & 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,
1961. However, in the said case, the conviction under Section
304­B of the IPC was set aside by this Court. However, the
question, as to whether when the charge is framed only under
Section 304­B of the IPC could the conviction be recorded under
Section 306 of the IPC did not fall for consideration in the said
case.
30.In   the   case   of   Thanu   Ram  vs.  State   of   Madhya
Pradesh8 this Court by observing that on account of interplay
between Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and
Sections 498­A, 107 and 306 of the IPC, held that the appellant
was   liable   for   conviction   for   the   offence   punishable   under
Section 498­A and Section 306 of the IPC. However, it is to be
noted   that   in   the   said   case   the   Court   relied   on   the   dying
declaration of the deceased wherein she stated that she had
been treated with both mental and physical cruelty. In the said
case, there was a dying declaration of the deceased which was
believed   by   the   court.   The   said   dying   declaration   was
corroborated by the evidence of PW­13, on the basis of which
8 (2010) 10 SCC 35324
the Court held that the ill treatment was such which triggered
her immediate intention to commit suicide.
31.In the case of   Satish Shetty   vs.  State of Karnataka9
the victim was found to have injuries on her person. Though,
the deceased and the husband had slept together in the same
room before she consumed poison, the appellant­husband had
not at all explained the injuries sustained by the victim. In these
circumstances, the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC, as
recorded by the High Court for the first time, was maintained by
this Court.
32.Insofar   as   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in   the   case   of
Narwinder   Singh   vs.  State   of   Punjab10,  it   is   by   the   two
learned   Judges   of   this   Court   and   it   does   not   take   into
consideration   the   judgment   by  three   learned   Judges   of   this
Court in Ramesh Kumar  (supra)..
33.Applying the aforesaid principles to the present case, we
find that though the prosecution is successful in proving the
case under Section 498­A of the IPC, we are of the view that the
prosecution has failed to prove that the cruelty was of such a
nature which left no choice to the deceased than to commit
suicide. The prosecution has not been in a position to place on
9 (2016) 12 SCC 759
10 (2011) 2 SCC 4725
record any evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that
any act or omission of the accused instigated the deceased to
commit suicide.   There is no material on record to show that
immediately prior to the deceased committing suicide there was
a cruelty meted out to the deceased by the accused due to
which the deceased had no other option than to commit the
suicide. We are of the view, that there is no material placed on
record to reach a cause and effect relationship between the
cruelty and the suicide for the purpose of raising presumption. 
34.It could further be seen from the evidence on record that
the   time   gap   between   the   last   visit   of   the   deceased   to   her
parents   with   regard   to   the   illegal   demand   and   the   date   of
commission of suicide is about two months.   As such, there is
nothing on record to show that there was a proximate nexus
between the commission of suicide and the illegal demand made
by the appellant.   In the case of   Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh
Sengar vs.  State of M.P.11 this Court found that there was time
gap of 48 hours between the accused telling the deceased ‘to go
and die’ and the deceased ‘committing suicide’.    As such, this
Court held that there was no material to establish that the
accused had abetted the suicide committed by the deceased. 
11 [ (2002) 5 SCC 371]26
35.Another aspect that needs consideration is that the cases
wherein this Court has held that the conviction under Section
306   of   the   IPC   was   tenable   though   charge   was   only   under
Section 304­B of the IPC, it was found the charge specifically
stated   that   the   deceased   was   driven   to   commit   suicide   on
account of cruelty meted out to the deceased. However, in the
present case, the charge reads thus:
“That   you   all   on   28.9.94   in   the   area   of   Village
Bohan, the death of Jaswinder Kaur wife of you,
Gurjit   Singh  and   daughter­in­law   of   you,   Gurdial
Singh and Mohinder Kaur and sister­in­law of Ranjit
Kaur,   was   caused   otherwise   than   under   normal
circumstances, you all being her relatives, within a
period of seven years of her marriage subjected to
her to cruelty and harassment for all in connection
with demand for dowry and thereby committed an
offence   of   dowry   death   punishable   under   section
304­B   of   the   Indian   Penal   Code,   and   within   my
cognizance.”
36.It would thus be seen, that the charge does not state that
the deceased was driven to commit suicide on account of the
harassment meted out to the deceased. It also does not mention
that the accused had abetted in commission of suicide by the
deceased. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered
view that the cases wherein conversion is held to be permissible
are clearly distinguishable.
37.In the foregoing circumstances, the appeals are partly
allowed.   Conviction   under   Section   498­A   of   the   IPC   is27
maintained and the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC is
set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge under Section
306 of the IPC.
38.The appellant is stated to be on bail, his bail bonds shall
stand discharged and he is directed to surrender within four
weeks for serving the remaining period of his sentence, if not
already undergone. 39.

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL  NO.  952 OF 2018
[@ SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.) NO. 2631 OF 2018]
ADARSH COOPERATIVE HOUSING SOCIETY LTD.    Appellant(s)

CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION            Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
KURIAN, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.This Court permitted the appellant to withdraw
the  amounts  claimed  by  the  banks  on  furnishing
security of immovable property, as per order dated
05.01.2018 in Criminal Appeal No. 19 of 2018.
3.When  the  appellant  offered  security  of  the
immovable property, wherein the housing complex is
situated, that was turned down as per the impugned
order  passed  by  the  CBI  Special  Judge,  Greater
Mumbai,  holding  that  the  disputed  structure  is
standing on the land, which is being offered as a
security and being the subject matter of the case,
the land cannot be accepted as a security.  Thus
aggrieved, the appellant is before this Court.2
4.We have heard Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, learned
Additional Solicitor General appearing for the first
respondent and Mr. Nishant R. Katneshwarkar, learned
counsel  appearing  for  the  State  of  Maharashtra.
Though the application is seriously opposed by both
the respondents, the fact remains that the land was
allotted to the appellant by the State of Maharashtra
on payment of Rs. 12.61 Crores, as per Allotment
Letter dated 09.07.2004.  The learned counsel for
appellant submits that the amounts which are frozen,
are required for litigation expenses and, therefore,
denial of the same would amount to denial of access
to justice.
5.In the above circumstances,  we do not propose to
go into the various contentions taken by the State
since we are only concerned with the release of the
amounts  on  offering  the  land  as  a  security.
Therefore, leaving all the contentions open, and
without prejudice to the contentions taken by the CBI
as well as by the State, the impugned order dated
01.03.2018 passed by the CBI Special Judge is set
aside.  The Special Judge, CBI is directed to accept
the security of the land, as offered by the appellant
and release the amounts.3
6.In view of the above, the appeal is disposed of.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5158 OF 2013
MOHAMMED SALIM (D) THROUGH LRS. & ORS. ..APPELLANTS
VERSUS
SHAMSUDEEN (D) THROUGH LRS. & ORS. ..RESPONDENTS
J U D G M E N T
MOHAN M. SHANTANAGOUDAR, J.
The judgment dated 05.09.2007 passed in S.A. No. 693 of
1994 by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam is the subject
matter of this appeal. By the impugned judgment, the High Court
set   aside   the   judgment   of   the   District   Court,
Thiruvananthapuram   dated   12.07.1994   passed   in   AS   No.
264/1989 and restored the judgment and decree passed in O.S.
No. 144/1984 by the Additional Sub Court, Thiruvananthapuram
dated 17.07.1989.
12.The facts leading to this appeal are that a suit for partition
and   possession   of   14/16th  share   in   the   Plaint   Schedule   ‘A’
property and half the rights over Plaint Schedule ‘B’ property was
filed   by   the     Respondent   No.   1   herein   (original   plaintiff).
Defendant No. 1 in the suit, Mohammed Idris, is the brother of
Mohammed Ilias, the father of the plaintiff, and  Defendant Nos.
2 to 7 are the children of Mohammed Idris.  Both the plaintiff’s
father and Defendant No. 1 are the sons of Zainam Beevi, who
expired in 1955. Both Plaint properties belonged to her. Plaint
Schedule ‘A’ property was gifted to Mohammed Ilias, based on a
gift deed executed by Zainam Beevi. 
The case of the plaintiff is that Defendant No. 8 namely
Saidat, was the first wife of Mohammed Ilias, and no issue was
born   out   of   the   said   wedlock.       Thereafter,   Mohammed   Ilias
married   Valliamma   in   1120   M.E.   (as   per   the   Malayalam
Calendar,   which   corresponds   to   1945   AD   in   the   Gregorian
system). Valliamma was a Hindu at the time of her marriage with
Mohammed   Ilias.   Both   Mohammed   Ilias   and   Valliamma   lived
together as husband and wife at Thiruvananthapuram. Later,
Valliamma was renamed Souda Beebi. Out of the said wedlock,
Shamsudeen (the plaintiff) was born. Subsequent to the death of
2Mohammed Ilias in 1947 AD, Valliamma (Souda Beebi) married
Aliyarkunju.
The plaintiff claimed that he was the only son of Mohammed
Ilias and on his death, he became entitled to 14/16th of the share
in   Schedule   ‘A’   property.   He   also   claimed   half   the   share   in
Schedule ‘B’ property through inheritance after the demise of
Zainam   Beevi,   as   the   same   would   have   devolved   upon   the
plaintiff, being the son of the predeceased son of Zainam Beevi,
and Mohammed Idris, Defendant No. 1, being the only surviving
son of Zainam Beevi. Hence, the suit was filed.
3.It is the case of the defendants that Valliamma was not the
legally wedded wife of Mohammed Ilias and that she was a Hindu
by religion at the time of marriage. She had not converted to
Islam at the time of her marriage, and thus the plaintiff being the
son of Valliamma, is not entitled to any share in the property of
Mohammed Ilias. It is their further case that Mohammed Ilias
had died two years prior to the birth of the plaintiff.
4.As mentioned supra, the trial Court decreed the suit and
the first appellate Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the
suit by setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court.
However, the High Court by the impugned judgment set aside the
3judgment passed by the first appellate Court and confirmed the
judgment   and   decree   passed   by   the   trial   Court.   Hence,   the
instant appeal was filed by the original defendants and the legal
representatives of those among them who have since died.
5.Mr. Guru Krishnakumar, learned Senior Counsel, taking us
through the material on record, submitted that the Trial Court
and   the   High   Court   were   not   justified   in   decreeing   the   suit,
inasmuch as the plaintiff himself had admitted that he was born
in the year 1949, whereas his alleged father Mohammed Ilias
expired in the year 1947. Therefore, the plaintiff could not be
treated as the son of Mohammed Ilias.  He further submitted that
since Valliamma was a Hindu by religion, she would not have any
right over the property of Mohammed Ilias, and consequently the
plaintiff would not get any share in the property of Mohammed
Ilias.
6.It   is   not in dispute that   Zainam   Beevi   gifted   Plaint
Schedule ‘A’ property to her son Mohammed Ilias. In view of the
gift deed in favour of Mohammed Ilias, upon his death, Schedule
‘A’   property   would   have   devolved   upon   his   legal   heirs   as   an
absolute   property   as   provided   under   Muslim   law.     Plaint
Schedule ‘B’ property admittedly belonged to Zainam Beevi and
4upon her death, it devolved on her legal heirs.   Since Zainam
Beevi had two sons, both the sons/their respective legal heirs
would have inherited half a share each after the death of Zainam
Beevi.  
7.It is also not in dispute that Defendant No. 8, Saidat is the
widow (first wife) of Mohammed Ilias. She has clearly admitted in
her written statement that Mohammed Ilias married Valliamma,
Defendant No. 9, and out of the said wedlock, the plaintiff was
born.   Exhibit A3 is the birth register extract of the plaintiff
maintained by the statutory authorities, which indicates that the
plaintiff is the son of Mohammed Ilias and Valliamma.   It is a
public document.  An entry in any public or other official book,
register or record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and
made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or
by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined
by   the   law   in   accordance   with   which   such   book,   register   or
record is kept, is itself a relevant fact, as per section 35 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  Exhibit A3 being a public document
is relevant to resolve the dispute at hand.  Additionally, a specific
pleading   was   found   in   the   plaint   that   Mohammed   Ilias   and
Valliamma were living together as husband and wife in House No.
5T.C.13 of Poojappura Ward in Thiruvananthapuram, which has
not been denied in the written statement of the defendants. 
As per Exhibit A3 mentioned above, the plaintiff was born
on 01.07.1124 M.E. (12.02.1949 as per the Gregorian Calendar)
and   the   same   has   not   been   seriously   disputed.   Admittedly,
Mohammed   Ilias   died   on   10.09.1124   M.E.     The   said   date
corresponds to 22.04.1949 in the Gregorian Calendar, as seen
from   the   Government   Almanac,   which   cannot   be   disputed
inasmuch as it is a public record maintained by the Trivandrum
Public Library (Government of Kerala). Thus, it can be concluded
that the plaintiff was born two months prior to the death of
Mohammed Ilias.  
Under these circumstances, in our considered opinion, the
Trial   Court  and   the   High   Court   were   justified   in   concluding,
based on the preponderance of probabilities, that Valliamma was
the legally wedded wife of Mohammed Ilias, and the plaintiff was
the child born out of the said wedlock.
8.The   High   Court,   in   our   considered   opinion,   was   also
justified in concluding that though the plaintiff was born out of a
fasid (irregular) marriage, he cannot be termed as an illegitimate
son of Mohammed Ilias.  On the contrary, he is the legitimate son
6of Mohammed Ilias, and consequently is entitled to inherit the
shares claimed in the estate of his father.  The High Court relied
upon various texts, including Mulla’s  Principles of Mahommedan
Law  (for   brevity   “ Mulla”)   and   Syed   Ameer   Ali’s   Principles   of
Mahommedan Law , to conclude that Muslim law does not treat
the marriage of a Muslim with a Hindu woman as void, and
confers legitimacy upon children born out of such wedlock.  
In the 21st edition of Mulla, at page 338, § 250, marriage is
defined as follows:­
“Marriage   (nikah)   is   defined   to   be   a   contract
which has for its object the procreation and the
legalizing of children.”
Thus it appears that a marriage according to Muslim law is not a
sacrament but a civil contract.  Essentials of a marriage are dealt
with in § 252 at page 340 of Mulla (21st edition) as follows:
“It is essential to the validity of a marriage that
there should be a proposal made by or on behalf
of one of the parties to the marriage, and an
acceptance of the proposal by or on behalf of the
other, in the presence and hearing of two male or
one male and two female witnesses, who must be
sane and adult Mohamedans. The proposal and
acceptance   must   both   be   expressed   at   one
meeting; a proposal made at one meeting and an
acceptance   made   at   another   meeting   do   not
constitute a valid marriage. Neither writing nor
any religious ceremony is essential.”
7§ 259(1) at page 345 of the 21st edition deals with difference
of religion, providing that marriage of a Muslim man with a non­
Muslim woman who is an idolatress or fire worshipper is not
void, but merely irregular. It reads:
“A   Mahomedan   male   may   contract   a   valid
marriage not only with a Mahomedan woman,
but also with a   Kitabia, that is, a Jewess or a
Christian, but not with an idolatress or a fire­
worshipper.   A   marriage   however,   with   an
idolatress or a fire­worshipper, is not void, but
merely irregular.”
Before proceeding further, it is crucial to note that under
Muslim law, there are three types of marriage—valid, irregular
and void, which are dealt with in § 253 at page 342 of  Mulla (21st
edition):
“A   marriage   may  be  valid  ( sahih),  or  irregular
(fasid) or void from the beginning ( batil).”
The High Court, while dealing with the contention that the
correct translation of the Arabic word “ fasid” was “invalid”, and
not “irregular”, and that therefore a   fasid  marriage was a void
marriage, considered the changes over time in the interpretation
of “fasid”. It would be worthwhile for us to refer to these changes
as well. In the 6th edition of Mulla, at §§ 197, 199 and 200,  fasid
8marriage is interpreted as “invalid”. So also in §§ 197, 199 and
204A of the 8th edition of Mulla, fasid is stated to mean “invalid”.
For instance, in the 6th  edition of  Mulla,   § 200 at page 162,
dealing with the difference of religion, reads:
“(1)   A   Mahomedan   male   may   contract   a   valid
marriage not only with a Mahomedan woman but
with a Kitabia, that is, a Jewess of a Christian,
but not with an idolatress or a fire­worshipper. If
he does marry an idolatress or a fire­worshipper
the   marriage   is   not   void   ( batil),   but   merely
invalid (fasid).” 
 (emphasis supplied)
§ 204A at page 164 of the same edition deals with the
distinction between void ( batil) and invalid ( fasid) marriage.   It
provides that a marriage which is not valid may be either void
(batil) or invalid (fasid). A void marriage is one which is unlawful
in itself, the prohibition against such a marriage being perpetual
and absolute. An invalid marriage ( fasid marriage) is described as
one which is not unlawful in itself, but unlawful “for something
else”, as here the prohibition is temporary or relative, or when the
invalidity arises from an accidental circumstance such as the
absence of a witness. § 204A(3) at page 165 of the 6th edition of
Mulla reads:
9“…Thus   the   following   marriages   are   invalid,
namely—
(a) a marriage contracted without witnesses, (ss.
196­197); 
(b) a marriage by a person having four wives with
a fifth wife (s. 198);
(c) a marriage with a woman who is the wife of
another, (s. 198A); 
(d) a marriage with a woman undergoing   iddat
(s.199); 
(e)   a   marriage   prohibited   by   reason   of
difference of religion (s. 200); 
(f) a marriage with a woman so related to the wife
that if one of them had been a male, they could
not have lawfully intermarried (s. 204)…”
(emphasis supplied)
The reason why the aforesaid marriages are invalid and not
void has also been provided later in the same paragraph. With
respect to marriages prohibited by reason of difference of religion,
it is stated thus:
“…in cl. (e) the objection may be removed by the
wife   becoming   a   convert   to   the   Mussulman,
Christian   or   Jewish   religion,   or   the   husband
adopting the Moslem faith…”
In the 10th edition, a change has been made to the meaning
of fasid marriage. In § 196A, valid, irregular and void marriages
are dealt with. It reads:
“A   marriage   may   be   valid   ( sahih)   or  irregular
(fasid), or void from the beginning ( batil).”
(emphasis supplied)
10From the 10th  edition onwards,   fasid  marriage has been
described as an irregular marriage, instead of invalid, but there
has been no change with regard to the  effect of a fasid marriage
from the 6th  edition onwards. The effects of an invalid ( fasid)
marriage have been dealt with in the 6th edition of Mulla at § 206
at page 166, clauses (1) and (2) of which read:
“(1) An invalid marriage has no legal effect before
consummation.
(2) If consummation has taken place, the wife is
entitled to dower [“proper” (s. 220) or specified (s.
218), whichever is less], and children conceived
and born during the subsistence of the marriage
are legitimate as in the case of a valid marriage.
But   an   invalid   marriage   does   not,   even   after
consummation,   create   mutual   rights   of
inheritance between the parties.”
In the 8th  edition of  Mulla, the effects of a   fasid  marriage
have been dealt with in § 206 at page 173. As in the 6th edition, it
is stated that children conceived and born during the subsistence
of   a  fasid  marriage   are   legitimate,   as   in   the   case   of   a   valid
marriage. As noted supra, the same position has been followed in
the   subsequent   editions   also,   except   that   fasid  has   been
described as “irregular” from the 10th edition onwards rather than
as “invalid”.
11Irrespective of the word used, the legal effect of a   fasid
marriage is that in case of consummation, though the wife is
entitled to get dower, she is not entitled to inherit the properties
of the husband.  But the child born in that marriage is legitimate
just like in the case of a valid marriage, and is entitled to inherit
the property of the father.
9. Evidently, Muslim law clearly distinguishes between a valid
marriage   (sahih),   void   marriage   ( batil),   and   invalid/irregular
marriage (fasid).   Thus, it cannot be stated that a   batil  (void)
marriage and a  fasid (invalid/irregular) marriage are one and the
same.   The effect of a   batil  (void) marriage is that it is void   ab
initio  and does not create any civil right or obligations between
the   parties.     So   also,   the   offspring   of   a   void   marriage   are
illegitimate (§ 205A of the 6th and 8th editions and §§ 205A of the
10th edition, and 266 of the 18th edition of Mulla).  Therefore, the
High Court correctly concluded that the marriage of Defendant
No. 9 with Mohammed Ilias cannot be held to be a  batil marriage
but only a fasid marriage.
1210. We find that  the same position has been reiterated in the 21st
edition of  Mulla as follows.    The distinction between void and
irregular marriages has been dealt with  in § 264 at page 349:
  “(1) A marriage which is not valid may be either
void or irregular.
(2)  A  void  marriage  is  one  which  is  unlawful  in
itself,  the   prohibition   against   the   marriage   being
perpetual and absolute. Thus, a marriage with a
woman   prohibited   by   reason   of   consanguinity
(§260), affinity (§261), or fosterage (§262), is void,
the   prohibition   against   marriage   with   such   a
woman being perpetual and absolute.
(3)   An   irregular   marriage   is   one   which   is   not
unlawful in itself, but unlawful ‘for something else,’
as where the prohibition is temporary or relative, or
when   the   irregularity   arises   from   an   accidental
circumstance, such as the absence of witnesses.
Thus the following marriages are irregular, namely
—
(a) a marriage contracted without witnesses (§
254);
(b) a marriage with a fifth wife by a person having
four wives (§ 255);
(c) a marriage with a woman undergoing  iddat (§
257);
(d)  a   marriage   prohibited   by   reason   of
difference of religion  (§ 259);
(e) a marriage with a woman so related to the
wife that if one of them had been a male, they could
not have lawfully intermarried (§ 263).
13The reason why the aforesaid marriages are
irregular, and not void, is that  in Clause (a) the
irregularity arises from an accidental circumstance;
in Clause (b) the objection may be removed by the
man divorcing one of his four wives; in Clause ( c)
the   impediment   ceases   on   the   expiration   of   the
period of iddat; in Clause (d) the objection may be
removed by the wife becoming a convert to the
Mussalman, Christian or Jewish religion, or the
husband   adopting   the   Moslem   faith;   and   in
Clause (e) the objection may be removed by the man
divorcing   the   wife   who   constitutes   the   obstacle;
thus if a man who has already married one sister
marries another, he may divorce the first, and make
the second lawful to himself.” 
(emphasis supplied)
The effect of an irregular ( fasid) marriage has been dealt
with in § 267 at pages 350­351 of the 21st  edition of  Mulla  as
follows:
“267. Effect of an irregular (fasid) marriage .—(1)
An irregular marriage may be terminated by either
party,   either   before   or   after   consummation,   by
words showing an intention to separate, as where
either party says to the other “I have relinquished
you”.   An   irregular   marriage   has   no   legal   effect
before consummation.
(2) If consummation has taken place—
(i)   the   wife   is   entitled   to   dower,   proper   or
specified, whichever is less (§ 286, 289);
14(ii) she is bound to observe the  iddat, but the
duration of the  iddat both on divorce and death is
three course (see § 257(2));
(iii)  the issue of the marriage is legitimate .
But an irregular marriage, though consummated,
does   not   create   mutual   rights   of   inheritance
between husband and wife...”
 (emphasis supplied)
The Supreme Court, in  Chand Patel v. Bismillah Begum ,
(2008) 4 SCC 774, while considering the question of the validity
of a marriage of a Muslim man with the sister of his existing wife,
referred to the above passages from  Mulla (from an earlier edition,
as reproduced in the 21st edition) while discussing the difference
between   void   and   irregular   marriages   and   the   effects   of   an
irregular marriage. 
11.  In   Syed   Ameer   Ali’s   Mohamedan   Law   also,   the   same
principle has been enunciated.  The learned author, while dealing
with the issue of the legitimacy of the children, observed at page
203 of Vol. II, 5th edition:
“The subject of invalid marriages, unions that are
merely invalid (fasid) but not void (batil) ab initio
under the Sunni Law, will be dealt with later in
detail, but it may be stated here that the issue of
invalid marriage are without question legitimate
according to all the sects.
15For   example,   if   a   man   were   to   marry   a   non­
scriptural woman, the marriage would be only
invalid, for she might at any time adopt Islam or
any other revealed faith, and thus remove the
cause   of   invalidity.   The   children   of   such
marriage, therefore, would be legitimate.”
Tahrir   Mahmood   in   his   book   Muslim   Law   in   India   and
Abroad, (2nd edition) at page 151 also affirms that the child of a
couple whose marriage is  fasid, i.e., unlawful but not void, under
Muslim   law   will   be   legitimate.   Only   a   child   born   outside   of
wedlock or born of a  batil marriage is not legitimate.
A.A.A.   Fyzee,   at   page   76   of   his   book   Outlines   of
Muhammadan Law  (5th edition) reiterates by citing  Mulla that the
nikah of a Muslim man with an idolater or fire­worshipper is only
irregular and not void. He also refers to Ameer Ali’s proposition
that   such   a   marriage   would   not   affect   the   legitimacy   of   the
offspring,   as   the   polytheistic   woman   may   at   any   time   adopt
Islam, which would at once remove the bar and validate the
marriage. 
12. The position that a marriage between a Hindu woman and
Muslim man is merely irregular and the issue from such wedlock
is legitimate has also been affirmed by various High Courts. (See
16Aisha  Bi  v.  Saraswathi   Fathima ,   (2012)   3   LW   937   (Mad),
Ihsan Hassan Khan v. Panna Lal , AIR 1928 Pat 19).
13. Thus, based on the above consistent view, we conclude that
the marriage of a Muslim man with an idolater or fire­worshipper
is neither a valid ( sahih) nor a void (batil) marriage, but is merely
an irregular ( fasid) marriage. Any child born out of such wedlock
(fasid  marriage)   is   entitled   to   claim   a   share   in   his   father’s
property.   It   would   not   be   out   of   place   to   emphasise   at   this
juncture that since Hindus are idol worshippers, which includes
worship of physical images/statues through offering of flowers,
adornment, etc., it is clear that the marriage of a Hindu female
with a Muslim male is not a regular or valid ( sahih) marriage, but
merely an irregular ( fasid) marriage.
14. In this view of the matter, the trial Court and the High
Court   were   justified   in   concluding   that   the   plaintiff   is   the
legitimate son of Mohammed Ilias and Valliamma, and is entitled
to his share in the property as per law.  The High Court was also
justified in modifying the decree passed by the trial Court and
awarding the appropriate share in favour of the plaintiff.   No
17issue has been raised before us relating to the quantum of share.
Accordingly, the appeal fails and stands dismissed.

2.In  State of Uttaranchal   vs.  Sandeep Kumar Singh and
others1 [Civil Appeal No.4494 of 2006) the following question arose
1 (2010) 12 SCC 794
1for consideration of this Court:
“Whether   a   person   belonging   to   a   Scheduled

entitled or not, to the benefits or concessions
allowed   to   Scheduled   Caste   candidate   in   the

3.In the course of the deliberations that took place this

Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao  vs. Dean, Seth G.S. Medical College and

perceived to be somewhat contrary to the view expressed by the
Constitution Bench in the above two cases.  This Court also took
note of the fact that a two judge Bench of this Court in  Subhash
2 (1990) 3 SCC 130
3 (1994) 5 SCC 244
4 (2005) 3 SCC 1
2Chandra   and   another   vs.   Delhi   Subordinate   Services   Selection
Board and others5  held that the dicta in   S. Pushpa  (supra) is an

the case i.e. State of Uttaranchal vs.   Sandeep Kumar Singh and
others (supra) took the view that  “it was not open to a two judge
Bench   to   say   that   the   decision   of   a   three   judge   Bench
rendered following the Constitution Bench judgments to be per
incuriam”.  In this regard, the canons of judicial discipline carved
out by this Court in   Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community
and another   vs. State of Maharashtra and another6  were recalled
and eventually in paragraph 13 of the opinion rendered in State of
Uttaranchal   vs.  Sandeep   Kumar   Singh   and   others   (supra)   the
reference of the question noted below was made to a larger Bench:
“13. A   very   important   question   of   law   as   to
interpretation   of   Articles   16(4),   341   and   342
arises for consideration in this appeal. Whether
the   Presidential   Order   issued   under   Article
5 (2009) 15 SCC 458
6 (2005) 2 SCC 673
3341(1) or Article 342(1) of the Constitution has
any   bearing   on   the   State’s   action   in   making
provision for the reservation of appointments or
posts in favour of any Backward Class of citizens
which,   in   the   opinion   of   the   State,   is   not
adequately represented in the services under the
State? The extent and nature of interplay and
interaction   among   Articles   16(4),   341(1)   and
342(1)   of   the   Constitution   is   required   to   be
resolved.”
4.The   said   Civil   Appeal   No.4494   of   2006   ( State   of
Uttaranchal vs. Sandeep Kumar Singh and others ) was disposed of
by the larger Bench of this Court by order dated 6th August, 2014,
in the light of the findings of the High Court recorded in paragraph
4 of the High Court order to the effect that the order impugned
suffers from an apparent illegality as the appointing authority of the
petitioner therein is the University and the University had acted at
the dictate of the State Government, which has no power to ask for
cancellation   of   an   appointment   made   in   accordance   with   the
advertisement.  In the aforesaid order dated 6th August, 2014 this
Court took the view that the conclusions recorded in paragraph 4 of
4the   High   Court   order   cannot   be   said   to   be   legally   flawed   and
accordingly closed the said Civil Appeal (No. 4494 of 2006) on the
aforesaid basis.  The question referred was not answered.  
5.However, the question arising and referred to in the State
of Uttaranchal vs.  Sandeep Kumar Singh and others  (supra) was felt
to   be   surviving   and   subsisting   in   the   present   appeals   also.
Accordingly, by an order of the Court dated 7th August, 2014, the
very same question as formulated in paragraph 13 of the judgment
in   State   of   Uttaranchal   vs.  Sandeep   Kumar   Singh   and   others
(supra), as extracted above, has been referred for an answer by a
five judge Bench of this Court.  That is how we are in seisin of the
matters. 
6.The factual matrix need not detain us and a brief resume
will suffice.  
The question as to whether a policy in furtherance of the
enabling provision contained in Article 16(4) of the Constitution of
5India   could   extend   to   giving   of   benefits   beyond   the   Scheduled
Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes   of   a   State/Union   Territory
enumerated   in   the   Presidential   Orders   framed/issued   under
Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India had arisen in the
bunch of writ petitions filed before the High Court of Delhi against
the   order/orders   of   the   Central   Administrative   Tribunal.     The
learned Tribunal following Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao  (supra) and
Action Committee  (supra), in preference to the view expressed in  S.
Pushpa (supra) (three judge Bench) held that insofar as the Union
Territory of Delhi is concerned, a migrant Scheduled Caste person
would not be entitled to the benefits conferred on members of the
Scheduled Castes enumerated in the list for the Union Territory of
Delhi   by   the   Presidential   Order   (i.e.   the   Scheduled   Castes   and
Scheduled Tribes Lists (Modification) Order, 1956) in question.  The
Delhi High Court sitting in a Full Bench (perhaps in view of the
importance of the question) found the decision in S. Pushpa (supra)
to be more directly relatable to the issue at hand i.e. being one of
6services in the Union Territory and, therefore, felt to be bound by
the decision of the three judge Bench of this Court in   S. Pushpa
(supra).  While doing so, the Delhi High court in paragraph 66 of
the   judgment   emphasised   on   the   necessity   of   an   authoritative
pronouncement on the issue(s) arising.   Accordingly, certificate to
appeal under Article 134­A of the Constitution was granted by the
High Court. Paragraph 66 of the judgment of the Full Bench of the
Delhi High Court will require a specific notice and is, therefore,
reproduced below:
“66. This court summarizes its conclusions, as
follows:   (1)   The   decisions   in   Marri,   Action
Committee, Milind and Channaiah have all ruled
that scheduled caste and tribe citizens moving
from   one   State   to   another   cannot   claim
reservation benefits, whether or not their caste is
notified in the state where they migrate to, since
the   exercise   of   notifying   scheduled   castes   or
tribes is region (state) specific, i.e "" in relation"" to
the state of their origin. These judgments also
took note of the Presidential Notifications, which
had enjoined such citizens to be ""residents"" in
7relation   to   the   state   which   provided   for   such
reservations.
(2) The considerations which apply to Scheduled
Caste and Tribe citizens who migrate from state
to state, apply equally in respect of those who
migrate from a state to a union territory, in view
of the text of Articles 341 (1) and 342 (1), i.e. only
those   castes   and   tribes   who   are   notified   in
relation   to   the   concerned   Union   Territory,   are
entitled to such benefits. This is reinforced by
the Presidential Notification in relation to Union
Territories, of 1951. Only Parliament can add to
such notification, and include other castes, or
tribes, in view of Articles 341 (2), Article 342(2)
which is also reinforced by  Article 16(3).    States
cannot   legislate   on   this   aspect;   nor   can   the
executive ­ Union or state, add to or alter the
castes, or tribes in any notification in relation to
a state or Union Territory, either through state
legislation   or   through   policies   or   circulars.
Differentiation between residents of states, who
migrate to states, and residents of states who
migrate   to   Union   Territories   would   result   in
invidious   discrimination   and   over­classification
thus   denying   equal   access   to   reservation
benefits,   to   those   who   are   residents   of   Union
Territories,   and   whose   castes   or   tribes   are
included in the Presidential Order in respect of
8such   Union   Territories.   The   Pushpa
interpretation has led to peculiar consequences,
whereby:
(i)   The   resident   of   a   state,   belonging   to   a
scheduled caste, notified in that state, cannot
claim   reservation   benefit,   if   he   takes   up
residence in another state, whether or not his
caste   is   included   in   the   latter   State's   list   of
scheduled castes;
(ii) However, the resident of a state who moves to
a Union Territory would be entitled to carry his
reservation   benefit,   and   status   as   member   of
scheduled caste, even if his caste is not included
as a scheduled caste, for that Union Territory;
(iii)   The   resident   of   a   Union   Territory   would
however, be denied the benefit of reservation, if
he moves to a State, because he is not a resident
scheduled caste of that State.
(iv) The resident of a Union Territory which later
becomes a State, however, can insist that after
such   event,   residents   of   other   states,   whose
castes may or may not be notified, as scheduled
castes, cannot be treated as such members in
such newly formed states;
(v) Conversely, the scheduled caste resident of a
state which is converted into a Union Territory,
cannot   protest   against   the   treatment   of
scheduled   caste   residents   of   other   states   as
members   of   scheduled   caste   of   the   Union
Territory,   even   though   their   castes   are   not
9included in the list of such castes, for the Union
Territory.
(3)   The   ruling   in   Pushpa   is   clear   that   if   the
resident of a state, whose caste is notified as
Scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, moves to a
Union Territory, he carries with him the right to
claim   that   benefit,   in   relation   to   the   Union
Territory, even though if he moves to another
state, he is denied such benefit (as a result of the
rulings   in   Marri   and   Action   Committee).   The
ruling in Pushpa, being specific about this aspect
vis­à­vis   Union   Territories,   is   binding;   it   was
rendered by a Bench of three judges. (4) The later
ruling   in   Subhash   Chandra   doubted   the
judgment   in   Pushpa,   holding   that   it   did   not
appreciate the earlier larger Bench judgments in
the correct perspective. Yet, Subhash Chandra
cannot be said to have overruled Pushpa, since it
was rendered by a smaller Bench of two judges.
This   approach   of   Subhash   Chandra   has   been
doubted, and the question as to the correct view
has been referred to a Constitution Bench in the
State of Uttaranchal case.
(5) By virtue of the specific ruling applicable in
the   case   of   Union   Territories,   in   Pushpa,
whatever may be the doubts entertained as to
the soundness of its reasoning, the High Courts
have to apply its ratio, as it is by a formation of
10three   judges;   the   said   decision   did   notice   the
earlier   judgments   in   Marri   and   Action
Committee.   Article   141   and   the   discipline
enjoined by the doctrine of precedent compels
this Court to follow the Pushpa ruling.
(6)   In   matters   pertaining   to   incidence   of
employment, such as seniority, promotion and
accelerated   seniority   or   promotional   benefits,
flowing out of Articles 16 (4A) and (4B) of the
Constitution,   there   may   be   need   for   clarity,
whichever rule is ultimately preferred ­ i.e the
Pushpa view or the Marri and Action Committee
view. In such event, it may be necessary for the
guidance of decision makers and High Courts, to
spell   out   whether   the   correct   view   should   be
applied   prospectively.   Furthermore,   it   may   be
also necessary to clarify what would be meant by
prospective application of the correct rule, and
whether such employment benefits flowing after
recruitment, would be altered if the Marri view is
to be preferred.”
7.Civil Appeal Nos.9935­9937 of 2014 from the decision of
the   Calcutta   High   court   pertain   to   claims   made   by   persons
belonging to Uraons and Mundas members of the Scheduled Tribes
11communities who have migrated to the Union Territory of Andaman
& Nicobar Island.  The High Court rejected the claim of reservation
made   by   the   aforesaid   migrants   Scheduled   Tribes   communities
confining   such   benefits   to   the   Scheduled   Castes   communities
enumerated   in   the   list   appearing   in   the   Presidential   Order
pertaining to the Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Island. 
8.Before delving into the constitutional provisions which
would be necessary to be dealt with for answering the reference a
brief  look  at the  pre­constitutional  position  on the issue would
throw considerable light and provide a sound insight to the multi­
faceted questions that the reference has given rise to. 
9.The caste system in India, which is the bane of a just
social order, has a long history which can be traced to the earliest
times.   Ancient Hindu religious scriptures refer to the practice.
Division of Society based on birth and the calling/profession of a
person has continued to dominate Hindu thinking and way of life
12and is perhaps one of the thorny problems inherited by the British
Administration which had tried to resolve the same by giving legal
recognition to what came to be termed as the “depressed classes”.
Such recognition was  in  the form of  a protective regime which
extended to representation in the Legislature and in the services
under the State.  Exercises in finding out the numerical strength of
the depressed class in the early 20th  Century (By Southborough
Committee) revealed a grim picture indicating such number to be as
high as 20 per cent of the majority population (Hindu) in eight (08)
Indian   Provinces   of   Madras,   Bombay,   Bengal,   United  Provinces,
Punjab, Bihar and Orissa, Central Provinces and Assam.  The above
figure did not include primitive or aboriginal tribes who later came
to be known as the Scheduled Tribes and included in the list of
Scheduled  Tribes under the  different  Presidential Orders issued
from time to time.
1310.The Government of India Act, 1935 (hereinafter referred
to as “1935 Act”) (also referred to as “the Constitution Act”) brought
into force the expression “Scheduled Castes” for the first time in
Indian Constitutional history.  Entry 26 Part I of the First Schedule
to the 1935 Act stipulates that “ the Scheduled Castes mean such
castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within the castes,
races or tribes, being castes, races, tribes, parts or groups,
which appear to His Majesty in Council to correspond to the
classes of persons formerly known as ‘the depressed classes’,
as His Majesty in Council may specify ”. 
11.Thereafter a Gazette Notification was published on 6th
June,   1936   promulgating   the   Government   of   India   (Scheduled
Castes)   Order,   1936   notifying   the   list   of   castes   that   are   to   be
considered as “the Scheduled Castes” across the territory of India.
A   look   at   the   Schedule   which   consisted   of   nine   (09)   parts   i.e.
Madras, Bombay, Bengal, United Provinces, Punjab, Bihar, Central
14Provinces, Assam, Orissa would indicate that identification of the
different castes for inclusion as Scheduled Castes in the Schedule
to the 1935 Act was based on an elaborate exercise conducted for
each of the Provinces so much so that while some castes have been
identified as Scheduled Castes throughout a Province, others have
been so identified to limited areas within a province.   The post
constitutional   exercise   by   the   Constitution   (Scheduled   Castes)
Order, 1950 and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950,
as   originally   enacted   under   Articles   341   and   342   of   the
Constitution, was basically an exercise in re­casting the Schedule to
the 1935 Act.   The subsequent amendments to the aforesaid two
Orders, from time to time, have been necessitated to bring the
position in tune with the amendments to the First Schedule to the
Constitution made at different points of time by creation of new
States and alterations in the area and boundaries of existing States.
1512.Article 366 of the Constitution which defines expressions
appearing in the Constitution specifically defines ‘Scheduled Castes’
[clause (24)] to mean “ such castes, races or tribes or parts of or
groups   within   such   castes,   races   or   tribes   as   are   deemed
under Article 341 to be Scheduled Castes for the purposes of
this Constitution ”. Similarly, clause (25) of Article 366 defines
“Scheduled Tribes” to mean “ such tribes or tribal communities
or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities
as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for
the purposes of this Constitution ”.
13.Part XVI of the Constitution of India deals with special
provisions   relating   to   certain   classes.     Article   330   provides   for
reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in
the House of the People (Lok Sabha) whereas Article 332 contains
similar provisions so far as the Legislative Assemblies of the States
16are concerned.  Article 335 of the Constitution provides that “ the
claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the
maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of
appointments to services and posts in connection with the
affairs of the Union or of a State ”.  By the Constitution (Eighty­
Second) Amendment Act, 2000 a proviso to Article 335 was added
to   provide   that   the   members   of   the   Scheduled   Castes   and
Scheduled Tribes may be granted relaxation in qualifying marks in
any   examination   or   standards   of   evaluation   can   be   lowered   in
matters of promotion to any class or classes of services or posts in
connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. Article 338 of
the Constitution provides for a National Commission for Scheduled
Cates which is invested with the following duties:
“(a)   to   investigate   and   monitor   all   matters
relating   to   the   safeguards   provided   for   the
Scheduled   Castes   under   this   Constitution   or
under any other law for the time being in force or
17under   any   order   of   the   Government   and   to
evaluate the working of such safeguards; 
(b)   to   inquire   into   specific   complaints   with
respect   to   the   deprivation   of   rights   and
safeguards of the Scheduled Castes; 
(c)   to   participate   and   advise   on   the   planning
process   of   socio­economic   development   of   the
Scheduled Castes and to evaluate the progress of
their   development   under   the   Union   and   any
State; the Scheduled Castes and to evaluate the
progress of their development under the Union
and any State;  
(d) to present to the President, annually and at
such other times as the Commission may deem
fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards;
deem   fit,   reports   upon   the   working   of   those
safeguards;  
(e) to make in such reports recommendations as
to the measures that should be taken by the
Union   or   any   State   for   the   effective
implementation   of   those   safeguards   and   other
measures for the protection, welfare and socio­
economic development of the Scheduled Castes;
and 
(f) to discharge such other functions in relation
to the protection, welfare and development and
advancement   of   the   Scheduled   Castes   as   the
President may, subject to the provisions of any
law made by Parliament, by the rule specify.”
1814.Similarly,   Article   338A   provides   for   a   National
Commission   for   Scheduled   Tribes   which   is   vested   with   similar
duties as in the case of the Commission for the Scheduled Castes.
15.Article 341(1) of the Constitution empowers the President
with respect to any State or Union Territory, and where it is a State,
after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification,
to specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within
castes,   races   or   tribes   which   shall   for   the   purposes   of   the
Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in relation to that
State or Union Territory, as the case may be. 
16.In   case   of   Scheduled   Tribes   the   President   has   been
similarly empowered under Article 342(1) of the Constitution.  Sub­
clause (2) of Article 341 and Article 342 empowers the Parliament
by   law   to   include   in   or   exclude   from   the   list   of   Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes specified in the Notification issued under
clause (1) thereof any caste, race or tribe/tribal community or part
19of or group within any caste, race or tribe/tribal community. It is
further provided that except as provided i.e. by Parliament by law(s)
made, the notification issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1)
shall   not   be   varied   by   any   subsequent   notification.       The
constitutional mandate, therefore, appears to be that any caste,
race or tribe/tribal community or part of or group within any caste,
race   or   tribe/tribal   community   as   has   been   specified   in   the
Presidential Order under clause (1) of Article 341 or Article 342 can
be altered only by Parliament by law(s) made.
17.Article 341 and Article 342 also makes it clear that the
caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe
as specified in the Presidential Order under Article 341(1) or a tribe
or tribal community as may be specified in the Presidential Order
under   Article   342(1)   shall   be   deemed   to   be   Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of the Constitution in
relation to that State or Union Territory, as the case may be.  The
20above   position   is   further   made   clear   by   clause   (2)   of   the   two
Presidential Orders which are in the following terms.
“Clause 2 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)
Order, 1950
2.   Subject   to   the   provisions   of   this   Order,   the
castes, races or tribes or parts of, or groups within,
castes or tribes specified in Parts I to XXV of the
Schedule   to   this   Order   shall,   in   relation   to   the
States to which those Parts respectively relate, be
deemed to be Scheduled Castes so far as regards
member thereof resident in the localities specified
in relation to them in those Parts of that Schedule.
Clause   2   of   the   Constitution   (Scheduled   Tribes)
Order, 1950
2. The Tribes or tribal communities, or parts of, or
groups   within,   tribes   or   tribal   communities,
specified in Parts I to XXII of the Schedule to this
Order shall, in relation to the States to which those
Parts   respectively   relate,   be   deemed   to   be
Scheduled   Tribes   so   far   as   regards   members
thereof   residents   in   the   localities   specified   in
relation to them respectively in those Parts of that
Schedule.”
18.There are various parameters by which a caste/race is
recognized as ' Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe'   in a State/Union
21Territory or a particular part thereof.  There is no doubt that before
the Presidential Orders were issued under Article 341(1) or under
Article 342(1), elaborate enquiries were made and only after such
enquiries that the Presidential Orders were issued. While doing so,
the Presidential Orders not only provided that even specified parts
or   groups   of   castes,   races   or   tribes/tribal   community   could   be
Scheduled Castes/Tribes in a particular State/Union Territory but
also made it clear that certain castes or tribes or parts/groups
thereof   could   be   Scheduled   Castes/Tribes   only   in
specified/particular areas/districts of a State/Union Territory.  The
reason for such an exercise by reference to specific areas of a State
is that judged by standards of educational, social backwardness,
etc. races or tribes may not stand on the same footing throughout
the State. The consideration for specifying a particular caste or tribe
or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes or Backward Classes in any given State depends on the
nature   and   extent   of   the   disadvantages   and   social   hardships
22suffered by the concerned members of the class in that State. These
may be absent in another State to which the persons belonging to
some other State may migrate.
19.The   Presidential   Orders   which   enumerate   lists   of
castes/races,   tribes   recognized   as   ' Scheduled   Caste/Scheduled
Tribe'  cannot be challenged or agitated in a court of law except,
perhaps, on the limited ground as held in M. Nagaraj and others  vs.
Union   of   India   and   others7.   A few  illustrations may clarify the
position.     The   question   whether   Dohar  caste   is   a   sub­caste   of
Chamar caste which is recognized as a scheduled caste came up for
consideration in  Bhaiya Lal vs. Harikishan Singh8. This Court held
that the court cannot enquire into whether  Dohar  caste is a sub­
caste of  Chamar  caste and whether the same must be deemed to
have   been   included   in   the   Presidential   Order.     In   Bhaiya   Lal
(supra),  this   Court   held   that   before   issuing   notifications   under
7 (2006) 8 SCC 212
8 AIR 1965 SC 1557
23Articles 341 and 342, an elaborate enquiry is made and as a result
of the enquiry social justice is sought to be done to the castes, races
or tribes as may appear to be necessary.  It was further held that
only   Parliament   is   empowered   to   amend   the   Notification   under
Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution, as is underlined by
the   expression   ""but   save   as   aforesaid   a   notification   issued
under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent
notification""  occurring in each of the said provisions. In   Bhaiya
Lal (supra), this Court held as under:­
""10...The object of Article 341(1) plainly is to provide
additional   protection   to   the   members   of   the
Scheduled   Castes   having  regard  to   the   economic
and   educational   backwardness   from   which   they
suffer. It is obvious that in specifying castes, races
or   tribes,   the   President   has   been   expressly
authorised to limit the notification to parts of or
groups within the castes, races or tribes, and that
must   mean   that   after   examining   the   educational
and social backwardness of a caste, race or tribe,
the President may well come to the conclusion that
not the whole caste, race or tribe but parts of or
groups within them should be specified.   Similarly,
the President can specify castes, races or tribes or
24parts thereof in relation not only to the entire State,
but in relation to parts of the State where he is
satisfied   that   the   examination   of   the   social   and
educational are backwardness of the race, caste or
tribe justifies such specification.   In fact, it is well
known  that before a notification is issued under
Article 341(1), an elaborate enquiry is made and it
is as a result of this enquiry that social justice is
sought to be done to the castes, races or tribes as
may appear to be necessary, and in doing justice,  it
would obviously be expedient not only to specify
parts or groups of castes, races or tribes, but to
make the said specification by reference to different
areas   in   the   State.   Educational   and   social
backwardness in regard to these castes, races or
tribes may not be uniform or of the same intensity
in the whole of the State; it may vary in degree or in
kind   in   different   areas   and   that   may   justify   the
division of the State into convenient and suitable
areas   for   the   purpose   of   issuing   the   public
notification in question ...""

20.Whenever States' reorganization had taken place in
the past, Parliament had exercised its powers under Article
341(2)   and   Article   342(2)   and   provided   for   specific
Castes/Tribes   that   were   entitled   to   be   recognised   as
Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes   in   relation   to   the
25reorganized   States/Union   Territories.   The   Scheme   of   the
Constitution   (Scheduled   Castes)   and   (Scheduled   Tribes)
Orders   makes   it   clear   that   Parliament's   intention   was   to
extend   the   benefits   of   reservation   in   relation   to   the
States/Union Territories only to the castes, races or tribes as
mentioned in the Presidential Orders.
21.The   Orders   of   1950   was   amended   by   the
Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order),
by   the   Amendment   Act,   1956   (Act   63/1956).     Another
amending Act was enacted by parliament in 1976.   Earlier,
orders had been made for the first time in relation to certain
territories, such as the Constitution (Andaman and Nicobar
Islands) Scheduled Tribes Order, 1959.  Further, amendments
had taken place as and when parliament reorganized states,
through separate Reorganisation Acts, which led to large scale
modification   of   the   Presidential   Orders.   Illustratively,   when
26new States/Union Territories were formed such as, Nagaland,
Pondicherry, or Sikkim, the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled
Tribes Orders were made in relation to the new States/Union
Territories,   for   instance,   the   Constitution   (Nagaland)
Scheduled   Tribes   Order,   1970­   after   the   reorganisation   of
Assam;   the   Constitution   (Sikkim)   Scheduled   Castes   Order,
1978; the Constitution (Sikkim) Scheduled Tribes Order, 1978)
upon creation of the State of Sikkim; the recent ones being
upon creation of the States of Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, and
Jharkhand. Likewise, when previous Union Territories (such
as Goa, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh) were constituted
into   States,   consequential   amendments   were   made   to   the
Scheduled   Castes   and   Tribes   Orders.     All   such
amendments/enactments were made by Parliament.  
22.Though   in   a   different   context   i.e.   in   relation   to
Backward Classes this Court in  M.C.D. v. Veena and Ors.9, has
9 (2001) 6 SCC 571
27specifically held that migrants are not entitled for reservation
as   Other   Backward   Classes   (OBCs)   in   the   States/Union
Territories where they have migrated.  The relevant portion of
the judgment that may be noticed is as hereunder:­
""6. Castes or groups are specified in relation
to   a   given   State   or   Union   Territory,   which
obviously   means   that   such   caste   would
include caste belonging to an OBC group in
relation to that State or Union Territory for
which it is specified. The matters that are to
be taken into consideration for specifying a
particular   caste   in   a   particular   group
belonging   to   OBCs   would   depend   on   the
nature and extent of disadvantages and social
hardships suffered by that caste or group in
that   State.   However,   it   may   not   be   so   in
another  State  to  which   a  person   belonging
thereto goes by migration. It may also be that
a caste belonging to the same nomenclature
is   specified   in   two   States   but   the
considerations on the basis of which they had
been specified may be totally different. So the
degree of disadvantages of various elements
which   constitute   the   data   for   specification
may also be entirely different. Thus, merely
because a given caste is specified in one State
as  belonging  to  OBCs  does  not  necessarily
mean that if there be another group belonging
to the same nomenclature in another State, a
person belonging to that group is entitled to
28the rights, privileges and benefits admissible
to the members of that caste. These aspects
have to be borne in mind in interpreting the
provisions of the Constitution with reference
to application of reservation to OBCs.""
23.A   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in   Marri
Chandra Shekhar Rao  (supra) had the occasion to consider the
question as to whether a member of the Gouda community
which is recognised as “ Scheduled Tribe ” in the Constitution
(Scheduled   Tribes)   Order,   1950   for   the   State   of   Andhra
Pradesh   would   be   entitled   to   admission   in   a   medical
institution situated in the State of Maharashtra. This Court
noticed   the   fact   that   the   father   of   the   petitioner   in   Marri
Chandra Shekhar Rao (supra)  was an employee in Fertilizer
Corporation   of   India,   a   public   sector   undertaking   and
thereafter in Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited, a
Government of India undertaking.  He belonged to the Gouda
community, a recognized Scheduled Tribe of Andhra Pradesh.
29On   his   appointment   he   was   stationed   at   Bombay.   The
petitioner   came   to   Bombay   at   the   age   of   nine   years.   He
completed his studies in Bombay; he submitted an application
for his admission in the medical institutions run by Bombay
Municipal   Corporation   which   was   denied.     This   denial   of
admission   was  based  on   the   Government  of   India  circular
dated 22nd February, 1985, according to which a person who
migrates from one State to another is entitled to the benefit of
being   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   in   the   State   of
origin and not in the State to which he or she migrates. The
appellant was held not entitled to be admitted to the Medical
College on the basis that he belonged to a Scheduled Tribe in
his original State i.e. Andhra Pradesh.  
24.After   referring   to   various   provisions   of   the
Constitution   of   India,   the   background   in   which   the
Presidential Orders were issued and several earlier judgments
of this Court, it was held as under:­
30""9.  It   appears   that   Scheduled   Castes   and
Scheduled Tribes in some States had to suffer
the social disadvantages and did not have the
facilities for development and growth. It is,
therefore, necessary in order to make them
equal   in   those   areas   where   they   have   so
suffered   and   are   in   the   state   of
underdevelopment   to   have   reservations   or
protection in their favour so that they can
compete   on   equal   terms   with   the   more
advantageous   or   developed   sections   of   the
community.   Extreme   social   and   economic
backwardness   arising   out   of   traditional
practices   of   untouchability   is   normally
considered   as   criterion   for   including   a
community  in  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes
and Scheduled Tribes.   The social conditions
of a caste, however, varies from State to State
and it will not be proper to generalise any
caste or any tribe as a Scheduled Tribe or
Scheduled Caste for the whole country . This,
however,   is   a   different   problem   whether   a
member or the Scheduled Caste in one part of
the country who migrates to another State or
any other Union territory should continue to
be treated as a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled
Tribe   in   which   he   has   migrated.   That
question   has   to   be   judged   taking   into
consideration the interest and well­being of
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
in the country as a whole.""
[underlining is ours]
3125.In Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao (supra) , rejecting the
contention   that   a   member   of   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled
Tribes should get the benefit of the status ' for the purpose of
the Constitution throughout the territory of India ', it was
observed   that   if   such   contention   is   to   be   accepted   the
expression   "" In   relation   of   that   State ""   would   become
nugatory. 
26.Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao  (supra) was followed by
another Constitution Bench of this Court in  Action Committee
(supra).  After referring to Articles 14, 15(1), 15(4), 16(4) and
19 and Part XVI of the Constitution of India and the decisions
governing the field and also Articles 341 and 342 , it was held
as under:­
""3. On a plain reading of clause (1) of Articles
341 and 342 it is manifest that the power of
the President is limited to specifying the castes
or tribes which shall, for the purposes of the
32Constitution,   be   deemed   to   be   Scheduled
Castes   or  Scheduled  Tribes   in  relation   to   a
State or a Union Territory, as the case may be.
Once a notification is issued under clause (1)
of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution,
Parliament can by law include in or exclude
from the list of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled
Tribes, specified in the notification, any caste
or tribe but save for that limited purpose the
notification issued under clause (1), shall not
be varied by any subsequent notification. What
is  important   to   notice  is  that  the  castes  or
tribes have to be specified in relation to a given
State or Union Territory.   That means a given
caste or tribe can be a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled   Tribe   in   relation   to   the   State   or
Union Territory for which it is specified. These
are the relevant provisions with which we shall
be concerned while dealing with the grievance
made in this petition.
....
16. We   may   add   that   considerations   for
specifying a particular caste or tribe or class
for   inclusion   in   the   list   of   Scheduled
Castes/Schedule Tribes or backward classes
in a given State would depend on the nature
and   extent   of   disadvantages   and   social
hardships suffered by that caste, tribe or class
in that State which may be totally non est  in
another   State   to   which   persons   belonging
thereto may migrate. Coincidentally it may be
that   a   caste   or   tribe   bearing   the   same
nomenclature is specified in two States but the
33considerations on the basis of which they have
been specified may be totally different. So also
the   degree   of   disadvantages   of   various
elements   which   constitute   the   input   for
specification   may   also   be   totally   different.
Therefore,   merely   because   a   given   caste   is
specified in State A as a Scheduled Caste does
not necessarily mean that if there be another
caste   bearing   the   same   nomenclature   in
another   State   the   person   belonging   to   the
former   would   be   entitled   to   the   rights,
privileges and benefits admissible to a member
of the Scheduled Caste of the latter State “for
the purposes of this Constitution”. This is an
aspect   which   has   to   be   kept   in   mind   and
which   was   very   much   in   the   minds   of   the
Constitution­makers   as   is   evident   from   the
choice of language of Articles 341 and 342 of
the Constitution....""
[underlining is ours]
27.Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao   (supra) and  Action
Committee  (supra)   were   followed   in   Subhash   Chandra   and
another  (supra).   After referring to various judgments on the
point and also the various circulars, this Court in   Subhash
Chandra and another  (supra) held as under:­
34""69.  Both   the   Central   Government   and   the
State Government indisputably may lay down
a   policy   decision   in   regard   to   reservation
having   regard   to   Articles   15   and   16   of   the
Constitution of India but such a policy cannot
violate other constitutional provisions. A policy
cannot  have primacy over the constitutional
scheme. If for the purposes of Articles 341 and
342 of the Constitution of India, State and the
Union Territory are on a par on the ground of
administrative exigibility ( sic) or in exercise of
the   administrative   power,   the   constitutional
interdict contained in clause (2) of Article 341
or clause (2) of Article 342 of the Constitution
of India cannot be got rid of.
.......
75. If a caste or tribe is notified in terms of the
Scheduled   Castes   Order   or   the   Scheduled
Tribes Order, the same must be done in terms
of   clause   (1)   of   Article   341   as   also   that   of
Article 342 of the Constitution of India, as the
case may be. No deviation from the procedure
laid down therein is permissible in law. If any
amendment/alteration   thereto   is   required   to
be made, recourse to the procedure laid down
under clause (2) thereof must be resorted to.""
28.In  Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao   (supra),  the
Constitution Bench observed that the expression "" in relation
to that State "" must be read meaningfully and harmoniously.
35It   was   observed   that   if   a   member   of   Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   gets   the   benefit   of   that   status
throughout the territory of India, the expression "" in relation
to   that   State ""  would   become   nugatory.     If   the   special
privileges   or   the   rights   granted   to   scheduled   castes   or
scheduled tribes in a particular State are to be made available
in all the States and if such benefits are to be carried from
State  ‘A’   to  State   ‘B’  on   migration,  the   mandate   of  Article
341/342 would get compromised.  Such a consequence must
be avoided for it is a fundamental rule of interpretation, be it
of a statutory enactment or of the Constitution, that wherever
and whenever there is a conflict between two provisions, the
same   should   be   so   interpreted   as   to   give   effect   to   both.
“…….Nothing is surplus in a Constitution and no part should
be made nugatory…..”. [ Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao  (supra)]
3629.The   issue   has   to   be   viewed   from   another
perspective.   If a member of a Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled
Tribe of Andhra Pradesh who had migrated to Maharashtra is
to   be   given   the   benefit   of   reservation   it   will   amount   to
depriving a member of a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe of
Maharashtra by reducing the reservation earmarked for them.
It is in this context, in   Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao (supra),
that the Constitution Bench observed as under:­
""14.  ....But having regard to the purpose, it
appears to us that harmonious construction
enjoins that we should give to each expression
—”in   relation   to   that   State”   or   “for   the
purposes   of   this   Constitution”   —   its   full
meaning and give their full effect. This must be
so  construed   that   one   must   not   negate   the
other. The construction that reservation made
in respect of the Scheduled Caste or Tribe of
that State is so determined to be entitled to all
the   privileges   and   rights   under   the
Constitution in that State would be the most
correct   way   of   reading,   consistent   with   the
language,   purpose   and   scheme   of   the
Constitution.   Otherwise,   one   has   to  bear   in
mind   that   if   reservations   to   those   who   are
treated as Scheduled Caste or Tribe in Andhra
37Pradesh are also given to a boy or a girl who
migrates and gets deducted ( sic  inducted) in
the State of Maharashtra or other States where
that caste or tribe is not treated as Scheduled
Caste   or   Scheduled   Tribe   then   either
reservation will have the effect of depriving the
percentage to the member of that caste or tribe
in   Maharashtra   who   would   be   entitled   to
protection or it would denude the other non­
Scheduled Castes or non­Scheduled Tribes in
Maharashtra to the proportion that they are
entitled to. This cannot be logical or correct
result designed by the Constitution.""
30.Unhesitatingly,   therefore,   it   can   be   said   that   a
person belonging to a Scheduled Caste in one State cannot be
deemed to be a Scheduled Caste person in relation to any
other   State   to   which   he   migrates   for   the   purpose   of
employment or education. The expressions "" in relation to
that State or Union Territory "" and ""for the purpose of this
Constitution ""  used   in   Articles   341   and   342   of   the
Constitution   of   India   would   mean   that   the   benefits   of
reservation   provided   for   by   the   Constitution   would   stand
38confined   to   the   geographical   territories   of   a   State/Union
Territory   in   respect   of   which   the   lists   of   Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   have   been   notified   by   the
Presidential   Orders   issued   from   time   to   time.     A   person
notified as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A' cannot claim the
same status in another State on the basis that he is declared
as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A'.  
31.In  S. Pushpa  (supra), the Pondicherry Government
had appointed Selection Grade Teachers in 1995 under the
Scheduled Castes quota from amongst the scheduled castes
candidates   registered   in   the   employment   exchange   in
Pondicherry but also extended the benefit of reservation to
scheduled   castes   candidates   of   other   States   and   Union
Territories.     The   Chennai   Bench   of   Central   Administrative
Tribunal   (“CAT”   for   short)   quashed   the   selection   process
holding   that   migrant   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes
39candidates could not be considered for appointment for posts
within the union territory of Pondicherry. In  S. Pushpa (supra)
the   issue   was   with   regard   to   the   extent   of   benefit   that
Scheduled Castes candidates of other States/Union Territories
would be entitled to in Pondicherry.  This Court held that in
the   matter   of   providing   reservation,   it   was   open   to   the
Pondicherry Government to apply or adopt a policy to give the
benefit   of   reservation   to   migrant   Scheduled   Castes   and
Scheduled Tribes.   In paragraphs 17 and 21 in   S. Pushpa
(supra), it was held as under:
“17. We do not find anything inherently wrong
or   any   infraction   of   any   constitutional
provision   in   such   a   policy.   The   principle
enunciated   in      Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao
cannot   have   application   here   as   UT   of
Pondicherry is not a State. As shown above, a
Union   Territory   is   administered   by   the
President through an Administrator appointed
by him. In the context of Article 246, Union
Territories are excluded from the ambit of the
expression “State” occurring therein. This was
clearly explained by a Constitution Bench in
T.M. Kanniyan  v. ITO. In New Delhi Municipal
40Council  v.  State   of   Punjab   the  majority has
approved the ratio of  T.M. Kanniyan  and has
held that the Union Territories are not States
for the purpose of Part XI of the Constitution
(para   145).   The   Tribunal   has,   therefore,
clearly   erred   in   applying   the   ratio   of   Marri
Chandra   Shekhar   Rao   in   setting   aside   the
selection   and   appointment   of   migrant   SC
candidates.
(underlining is ours)
*** *** ***
21.  ....Article   16(4)   is   not   controlled   by   a
Presidential Order issued under Article 341(1)
or Article 342(1) of the Constitution in the
sense   that   reservation   in   the   matter   of
appointment on posts may be made in a State
or Union Territory only for such Scheduled
Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes   which   are
mentioned in the Schedule appended to the
Presidential Order for that particular State or
Union Territory. This article does not say that
only such Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes   which   are   mentioned   in   the
Presidential   Order   issued   for   a   particular
State alone would be recognised as backward
classes of citizens and none else. If a State or
Union   Territory   makes   a   provision
whereunder   the   benefit   of   reservation   is
extended only to such Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled   Tribes   which   are   recognised   as
such   in   relation   to   that   State   or   Union
41Territory   then   such   a   provision   would   be
perfectly valid. However, there would be no
infraction of clause (4) of Article 16 if a Union
Territory   by   virtue   of   its   peculiar   position
being governed by the President as laid down
in   Article   239   extends   the   benefit   of
reservation even to such migrant Scheduled
Castes   or   Scheduled   Tribes   who   are   not
mentioned in the Schedule to the Presidential
Order issued for such Union Territory. The
UT of Pondicherry having adopted a policy of
the   Central   Government   whereunder   all
Scheduled   Castes   or   Scheduled   Tribes,
irrespective of their State are eligible for posts
which are reserved for SC/ST candidates, no
legal   infirmity   can   be   ascribed   to   such   a
policy and  the same cannot be held to be
contrary to any provision of law.""
32.The upshot of the aforesaid discussion would lead
us to the conclusion that the Presidential Orders issued under
Article 341 in regard to Scheduled Castes and under Article
342 in regard to Scheduled Tribes cannot be varied or altered
by any authority including the Court.   It is the Parliament
alone which has been vested with the power to so act, that too,
by laws made. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes thus
42specified in relation to a State or a Union Territory does not
carry the same status in another State or Union Territory.
Any   expansion/deletion   of   the   list   of   Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes by any authority except Parliament
would be against the constitutional mandate under Articles
341 and 342 of the Constitution of India.
33.Article 16(4) is an enabling provision.  It enables the
State   to   provide   to   backward   classes   including   Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes reservation in appointments to
public services.  Such reservation is to be provided on the basis
of quantifiable data indicating the adequacy or inadequacy, as
may be, of the representation of such classes in Government
service.  The data which is the basis of the satisfaction of the
State being verifiable, is open to judicial scrutiny on the limited
ground   of   relevance   of   the   circumstances   on   which   the
satisfaction   is   moulded.     The   policy   decision   to   provide
43reservation, of course, is beyond the pale of judicial review.
34.It is an unquestionable principle of interpretation
that interrelated statutory as well as constitutional provisions
have to be harmoniously construed and understood so as to
avoid making any provision nugatory and redundant.  If the list
of   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   in   the   Presidential
Orders under Article 341/342 is subject to alteration only by
laws made by Parliament, operation of the lists of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes beyond the classes or categories
enumerated   under   the   Presidential   Order   for   a   particular
State/Union Territory by exercise of the enabling power vested
by Article 16(4) would have the obvious effect of circumventing
the specific constitutional provisions in Articles 341/342.   In
this regard, it must also be noted that the power under Article
16(4) is not only capable of being exercised by a legislative
provision/enactment but also by an Executive Order issued
44under Article 166 of the Constitution.  It will, therefore, be in
consonance with the constitutional scheme to understand the
enabling provision under Article 16(4) to be available to provide
reservation   only   to   the   classes   or   categories   of   Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes enumerated in the Presidential orders
for a particular State/Union Territory within the geographical
area of that State and not beyond.  If in the opinion of a State it
is   necessary   to   extend   the   benefit   of   reservation   to   a
class/category of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes beyond
those   specified   in   the   Lists   for   that   particular   State,
constitutional discipline would require the State to make its
views in the matter prevail with the central authority so as to
enable an appropriate parliamentary exercise to be made by an
amendment of the Lists of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes
for that particular State.   Unilateral action by States on the
touchstone   of   Article   16(4)   of   the   Constitution   could   be   a
possible trigger point of constitutional anarchy and therefore
45must be held to be impermissible under the Constitution.
35.The decision in  S. Pushpa (supra) may now be taken
up to understand the basis on which the conclusion recorded
therein was recorded. In   S. Pushpa  (supra) a distinction was
found by this Court in the constitutional status of a Union
Territory   and   a   State   in   relation   to   the   Union/Central
Government.     The provisions of Article 239 and 239A of the
Constitution; Section 3(8) of the General Clauses Act, 1897
defining   ‘Central   Government’   and   the   provisions   of   the
Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 were considered to
arrive at the following conclusion:
“14. The effect of these provisions is also
that   the   Administrator   (Lt   Governor   of
Pondicherry) and his Council of Ministers
act under the general  control of and  are
under   an   obligation   to   comply   with   any
particular direction issued by the President.
Further, the Administrator (Lt Governor of
Pondicherry) while acting under the scope
of the authority given to him under Article
239   of   the   Constitution   would   be   the
46Central Government.”
36. It   is   on   the   aforesaid   basis   that   the   concerned
Notification/Government Order dated 16th February, 1974 by
which   it   was   provided   that   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled
Tribes   candidates   from   outside   the   Union   Territory   of
Pondicherry   should   also   be   considered   for   appointment   to
posts reserved for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the
Union Territory Administration and the communication of the
Government of India dated 6th October, 1995 to the same effect
were upheld.  
37.The First Schedule to the Constitution, as original
enacted, provided for three (03) categories of States i.e. Part
‘A’, Part ‘B’ and Part ‘C’ States to comprise the territory of
India.     The   States   Reorganization   Act,   1956   and   the
consequential Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956
drastically altered the provisions of the First Schedule to the
47Constitution by establishment of new States; alteration in the
area and boundaries of existing States and also by abolition of
the three (03) categories of States; and by classification of
certain   areas   as   Union   Territories.     Pursuant   thereto   the
Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 was enacted to
provide for Legislative Assemblies and Councils of Ministers
for certain Union Territories and for certain other incidental
matters.  It will not be necessary to specifically deal with the
provisions of the aforesaid Act in any great detail except to say
that in course of time most of the Union Territories (except for
Pondicherry),   which   had   been   provided   with   their   own
Legislatures   and   Councils   of   Ministers   have   graduated   to
become full­fledged States on the basis of enactment of several
State   Reorganisation   Acts   details   of   which   have   been
mentioned (para 21).  The Union Territory of Pondicherry, as
on   date,   stands   out   as   sole   Union   Territory   which   has   a
Legislature and Council of Ministers, apart from Delhi.  
4838.Delhi,   which   was   one   of   the   original   Union
Territories, came to be called as “National Capital Territory of
Delhi”.     This   change   was   introduced   by   the   Constitution
(Sixty­Ninth   Amendment)   Act,   1991   with   effect   from   1st
February, 1992 by insertion of Article 239­AA in Part VIII of
the Constitution (i.e. Special provisions with respect to Delhi).
Article 239­AA(3)(a) empower the Legislative Assembly of the
National Capital Territory of Delhi to make laws with respect
to   any   matters   enumerated   in   the   State   List   or   in   the
Concurrent List (i.e. List II and List III of the Seventh Schedule
to the Constitution of India) subject to certain exceptions.  It is
here that the Union Territory of Delhi i.e. National Capital
Territory of Delhi is enjoined a special status inasmuch as
power to enact laws on any of the subjects in List II and List III
is a constitutional conferment as opposed to the position in
the  erstwhile Union  Territories and the  present  day Union
49Territory of Pondicherry where the power to frame/make laws
has been conferred on the Union Territory Legislatures by a
Parliamentary enactment i.e. Section 18 of the Government of
Union Territories Act, 1963.   The above narration has been
considered necessary only to make the discussion complete.
We make it clear that we are not entering into any discussion
as to the special position/status of Delhi, if any, by virtue of
the provisions contained in Article 239AA as the said issue
does not arise for consideration in the present reference.  
39.The above view coupled with the scope and ambit of
the present reference may also not require us to go into the
correctness of the view expressed by this Court in paragraph
14 of the decision in  S. Pushpa (supra) (as already extracted).
The resolution of the question formulated for an answer is
capable   of   being   reached   by   adopting   an   entirely   different
perspective which we intend to do hereinafter.
5040.The federal nature of the Constitution finds broad
manifestation in two principal areas i.e. division of legislative
power and exercise thereof by the Union and the constituent
States and secondly, which is more relevant and important to
the subject in hand, is the constitutional provisions relating to
services under the Union and the States as dealt with in Part
XIV of the Constitution.
41.The subject finds an elaborate study by Dr. D.D.
Basu   in   “Commentary   on   the   Constitution   of   India”10.
According to Dr. D.D. Basu, “ In India though the Union and
the States have their own public services, (vide Entry 70
of List I and Entry 41 of List II) there is no clear­cut
bifurcation in the administration of the Union and the
State laws as in the U.S.A. The State officials administer
the State laws as well the Union laws applicable within
10 8th Edition, 2011, Volume 9, Page 9858
51that Sate whereas the members of the Union Services
while working within a State, also carry out State laws,
insofar as they may be applicable. The second peculiarity
of the Indian federal system of administration is that
though   the   federal   and   State   Governments   have   civil
services of their own to manage their own households,
there   are   certain   services   known   as   the   All­India
Services,   which   are   common   to   both   the   federal   and
State Governments. 
The organisation of the Civil services in the Indian
federal system may be demonstrated as thus: 
All India Services
Central Civil 
ServicesState Civil Services
Central Secretariat 
Services” Subordinate Services
        
5242.At the State Level, as Dr. D.D. Basu points out,  “the
State   Civil   Services   administer   the   subject   solely
belonging   to   the   State   Governments,   according   to   the
federal   distribution   of   subjects   thus   including   the
Judicial,   Executive,   Medical,   Engineering,   Police,
Education   branches.   Their   members   are   under   the
exclusive control of the respective State Governments and
their duties are confined to the territories of the State by
which   they   have   been   appointed,   unless   sent   on
deputation to the Union Government ”.11   These  State Civil
Services  may be Administrative Services, Forest Services etc.
[illustratively, in case of Himachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh
Administrative   Service   (HPAS)   is   a   type   of   service,   so   is,
Himachal Pradesh Forest Service (HPFS).   The  recruitment to
these   services   is   conducted   by   way   of   Civil   Services
11 8th Edition, Volume 9, 2011, Page 9860.
53Examinations organised by the State­specific Public Service
Commission e.g. in case of Himachal Pradesh, it is Himachal
Pradesh Public Service Commission.  As stated earlier, persons
inducted into the State Service of a particular State cannot be
transferred to any other State. These officers are concerned
with only the affairs of the state in which they are appointed.
These services (like HPAS, HPFS) may, for convenience, be
called as Superior Services/Higher Services with reference to a
State.  But in addition to these higher services, there are also
services   that   may,   again   for   convenience,   be   called   as
Subordinate Services/Lower Level Jobs. The posts in these
services are like those of Clerks, School Teachers; Drivers,
Attendants, Safai Workers, etc.  For the purpose of recruitment
of Subordinate Servants, states have in place   State­specific
Selection Commissions .
5443.At the  Federal Level , civil administration is carried
out by the members of – (1)   All  India  Services   (specifically
provided for in Article 312); (2)  Central Civil Services  (although,
not   specifically   provided   for   in   the   Constitution   but   are
regulated   by   creation   of   statutory   Rules   framed   under   the
proviso to Article 309). These are again Superior Services and
the   selection/recruitment   is   by   the   Union   Public   Service
Commission.
ALL INDIA SERVICES
There   are   three   All   India   Services   (AIS)   –   (a)   Indian
Administrative Service (IAS); (b) Indian Forest Service (IFoS); (c)
Indian Police Service (IPS). As regards AIS, Dr. D.D. Basu12
says   that,  “the peculiarity  of the AIS from the federal
standpoint is that –
(a)Though they are recruited and their conditions
12 8th Edition, 2011, Volume 9, Page 9858.
55of service are determined by the Union Government, they
have to administer both Union and the State subjects,
accordingly as their services are placed at the disposal of
the Union or a State Government, in connection with the
affairs of the Union or the State, as the case may be.
(b)While serving in a State, they are controlled by
the State Government, except as regards the imposition of
the   penalty   of   dismissal,   removal   or   compulsory
retirement,   which   can   be   awarded   only   by   the   Union
Government.
(c)In a sense, this system is an exception to the
usual federal precedent inasmuch as it is intended to fill
up the strategic posts both under the Union and State
Governments by men of superior calibre, recruited on a
uniform basis, through the UPSC. Thus, while a Deputy
56Collector may be a member of the State Civil Service, the
Additional Collector and the Collector may be members of
the Indian Administrative Service. The category of AIS
thus breaks through the federal division so far as the
administrative services in India are concerned. In fact,
the   principal   agents   of   a   Sate   administration   are
members of the AIS and it would be a mistake to suppose
that the AIS exist for the administration of the Union
subjects. Broadly, speaking, the administration of a State
is run both by the members of the AIS and State Services,
the   latter   supplying   only   the   intermediate   and
subordinate tiers.
(d)Though the bulk of recruitment to the AIS is by
competitive examination, a certain proportion is selected
by promotion from amongst members of the State Civil
57Services.
(e)Though a member of AIS may be required to
serve anywhere in India, on recruitment, he is usually
assigned to a State or States jointly, or, in a technical
language, is included in a State cadre or Joint cadre and
continues to serve there until or unless he is called upon
to serve the Union Government, in any of its Departments.
(f)While   employed   under   a   State,   again,   the
members  of   the  AIS   do  not   have  to   work   only   in  the
Secretariat   of   the   State   but   also   in   the   Districts   as
already   stated   and   members   of   these   services   are
expected   to   acquire   experience   of   the   business   in   the
district as well as Secretariat administration and there
is   a   constant   interchange   of   officers   between   the
Secretariat and the Districts, just as there is such an
58interchange   between   the   States   and   the   Union
Secretariats on the other hand. ”  
44.Therefore, the members of the All India Services are
common to the Union and the States and they serve, by turn,
both the Union and State Governments. The members of these
services although recruited by the Centre their services are
placed under various State cadres . “It is evident from Article
312(1) that the members of the AIS are common to the
Union   and   the   States.   Curiously,   however,   there   is   a
cadre for the Indian Administrative Service only in the
States,  according  to  the Indian Administrative Service
(Cadre) Rules, 1954 and there is no separate cadre for
members of this service in the Government of India. Each
members of the Indian Administrative Service therefore,
59belongs to the cadre of one State or the other .”13 
45.There   are   many   State   Cadres   e.g.   Bihar   Cadre,
Rajasthan Cadre and Joint Cadres like AGMUT (for Arunachal
Pradesh + Goa + Mizoram + the 7 Union Territories). These
officers remain in the allotted Cadres till they retire. They are
not normally to be transferred from one State Cadre to another
State Cadre though they have the accountability to serve both
under the State and the Centre.
46.At this juncture, the Union of India’s Affidavit may
also be referred to, which states with reference to AIS that,
“the   conditions   of   service   of   these   services   (AIS)   are
regulated by the DoPT by way of executive and statutory
instructions,   statutory   rules   formulated   under   Article
309 of the Constitution and Act of Parliament etc. The
functional control of some of the services rests with other
13 D.D. Basu, 8th Edition, 2011, Volume 9, Page 10585.
60Ministries and Departments also. The Ministry of Home
Affairs   exercises   functional   control   on   IPS   and   the
Ministry   of   Environment   &   Forest   &   Climate   Change
exercises functional control on IFoS. Members of these
services are allocated a cadre under a State or Union
Territory and they serve the Union as well as the State,
whichever is allotted to them. Thus their services are All
India Services. Their recruitment is by the Union Public
Service Commission and as they serve the Union as well
as the States, their recruitment is on pan India basis.
Every   citizen   of   this   country   having   the   required
qualification   is   eligible   to   be   considered   for   the
appointment. It is pertinent to note that before selection
in the AIS, there is no specification or indication of the
cadre in Union, Union Territory or State, which they may
61serve.   Upon   selection   alone,   they   would   be   allocated
cadre depending upon the merit and the preferences they
would have made at the time of applying. Upon selection
they could be allocated to serve through any of the 25
states   or   7   Union   Territories   of   Delhi;   Puducherry;
Chandigarh;   Daman   &   Diu;   Dadra   &   Nagar   Haveli;
Andaman   &   Nicobar;   Lakshadweep   coupled   with   the
states of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram ”14.
47.CENTRAL CIVIL SERVICES
The Central Civil Services (CCS), as Dr. D.D. Basu
points   out,   “ are   engaged   in   administering   the   Union
subjects, such as the Posts and Telegraphs, Customs and
Excise,   Income   Tax.   In   short,   these   constitute   all   the
administrative services in the Central Departments which
have not so far been included in the list of All India
14 Para 5 of the Affidavit.
62Services.   They   are   under   the   exclusive   control   of   the
Union Government. Besides the Central Services, there are
other Services intended for work solely in the Central
Secretariat, or, in other words, those who are to manage
the offices of the Central Departments. Both the Central
Civil Services and Central Secretariat Services are sub­
divided   into   Class   I,   II,   III,   IV,   (=   Group   A,   B,   C,   D15)
according   to   the   rank   and   responsibilities   of   the
officers… Members of the Central Services are also sent
on transfer or deputation to States where offices relating
to   the   Union   subjects   or   Public   Sector   Undertakings
relating thereto are located .”16 All that we would like to add
15 Rule 6A of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)
Rules, 1965 provides that, “ All reference to Central Civil Services/Central
Civil Posts, Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV in all Rules, Orders,
Schedules, Notifications, Regulations, Instructions in force, immediately
before the commencement of these rules shall be construed as references to
Central Civil Services/Central Civil Posts, Group 'A', Group 'B', Group 'C'
and Group 'D' respectively, and any reference to ""Class or Classes"" therein
in this context shall be construed as reference to ""Group or Groups"", as the
case may be.”
16 8th Edition. Volume 9, Page 9859.
63is that though the members of these services are concerned
only with the affairs of the Union/Centre they discharge such
duties   in   the   offices   and   establishments   of   the   Union
Government as may be located in the States and the Union
Territories.  The Central Civil Services (Classification, Control
and Appeal) Rules, 1965 [CCS Rules, 1965] (enacted under the
proviso to Article 309) are the governing statutory Rules with
reference   to   these   services.   Rule   4   of   CCS   Rules,   1965
classifies the Central Civil Services into four types – 
(i)Central Civil Services, Group A (45 services as per
the Schedule to the Rules);
(ii)Central Civil Services, Group B (33 services as per
the Schedule to the Rules);
(iii)Central Civil Services, Group C (5 services as per the
Schedule to the Rules);
(iv)Central Civil Services, Group D (1 service as per the
64Schedule to the Rules)17.
48.CCS Group A : 
The   Affidavit   of   the   Union   of   India   says   that,
“recruitment to Group A services is made by UPSC. The
recruitment is again on all India basis. This is the reason
the personnel belonging to these 45 services work in the
posts of Union and the Union Territories (UT) across the
length and breadth of the country. The Cadre Controlling
Authority   of   Group   A   services   are   the   respective
ministries of the Government of India. For example, the
first service being the Archaeological Service, the Cadre
Controlling Authority is the Ministry of Culture, Central
Government. Another example, the 12th service being the
Indian Foreign Service and this is controlled by Ministry
17 Para 6 of the Affidavit.
65of External Affairs. No. 16 is the Indian Revenue Service
and   it   is   controlled   by   the   Ministry   of   Finance.   The
members of these services being recruited pursuant to the
Central   Service   Exams   conducted   by   the   UPSC   are
allocated to the respective services. Whichever Ministry
seeks   recruitment   to   the   service   in   this   Group,   sends
requisition to UPSC as per procedure prescribed and UPSC
accordingly   advertises   for   the   post   in   Group   A.   Every
citizen   of   India   is   eligible   to   apply   as   per   the
qualifications and requirements in the notification. DOPT
is   the   nodal   Ministry   for   regulating   the   conditions   of
service of all Central Civil Services as per Allocation of
Business Rules. As per the conditions of service, every
employee is required to give an undertaking agreeing to
the conditions of all India transfer liability at the time of
66joining service. Central Civil Services employees belonging
to Group A serve the Union of India and that is the reason
why these services are across the length and breadth of
the country, wherever there is an office of the Central
Government. Member of the Groups A service are governed
by CCS Rules of 1965 as well as Central Civil Services
(Conduct)   Rules   1972;   Central   Civil   Services   (Pension)
Rules 1972 and such other Rules made by the Central
Ministries.”
49.CCS Group B : 
As   mentioned  earlier,   there   are   33   Group   B  Services.
Amongst these, are the Union Territory Services listed at No.
28 and No. 29 and known as the ‘Delhi and Andaman and
Nicobar   Islands   Civil   Service’   abbreviated   as   ‘DANICS’   and
‘Delhi and Andaman and Nicobar Islands Police Service’ (Grade
67II) abbreviated as ‘DANIPS’.  While at this stage we may have
also a look at Union Territory services in some detail.
UNION TERRITORY SERVICES
50.The Government of India (Ministry of Home Affairs)
by way of a notification dated 6th  August, 2003, and in the
exercise of the proviso to Article 309, enacted ‘the National
Capital   Territory   of   Delhi,   Andaman   and   Nicobar   Islands,
Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Havel
(Civil Service) Rules, 2003 [DANICS Rules, 2003]. As also, ‘the
National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi,   Andaman   and   Nicobar
Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar
Havel (Police Service) Rules, 2003 [DANIPS Rules, 2003].
51.The DANICS/DANIPS Rules, 2003 define:­
* ‘Administration ’   to   mean   the   Government   of   the
National Capital Territory of Delhi in respect National Capital
68Territory   of   Delhi   and   Union   Territory   Administration   in
respect   of   the   Union   Territories   of   –   Andaman   &   Nicobar
Islands; Lakshadweep; Daman & Diu; Dadra & Nagar Haveli
[under Rule 2(a)]
*   ‘Commission’   to   mean   the   Union   Public   Service
Commission [under Rule 2(h)].
*   ‘Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes ’   to   have   the
same meaning as are assigned to them by Articles 366(24) and
366(25) [under Rule 2(n)].
The DANICS/DANIPS Rules, 2003, further, state that posts in
Junior Administrative Grade­I, Junior Administrative Grade­II,
Selection   Grade   will   be   Central   Civil   Services   (Group   A),
whereas Entry Grade shall be Central Civil Services (Group B)
[Rule 3]. The vacancies in DANICS/DANIPS shall be filled in on
the basis of the Civil Services Examination conducted by UPSC
[Rule 7].   Every member of DANICS/DANIPS allocated to an
69Administration shall be posted against a duty post18 under the
Administration   by   the   Administrator   [Rule   12].   More
importantly, the Government of India shall, from time to time,
allocate a member of DANICS/DANIPS to any Administration
for posting [Rule 12]. Nothing in the Rules affects reservations,
relaxation in age­limit and other concessions required to be
provided   for   the   Scheduled   Castes,   the   Scheduled   Tribes,
Other   Backward   Classes   and   other   special   categories   of
persons   in   accordance   with   the   orders   issued   by   the
Government of India from time to time in this regard [Rule 17:
the Saving clause]. The Sanctioned Strength for DANICS and
DANIPS is in the DANICS/DANIPS Rules, 2003 (approximately
398 DANICS; approximately 355 DANIPS).  
52.As per the Union of India’s Affidavit, DANICS and
18 Duty Posts are mentioned in the Schedule to these Rules. To name a few,
these are - Joint Director of Social Welfare/Delhi; Joint Director of
Education/Delhi; Deputy Medial Superintendent of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain
Hospital/Delhi; Registrar of Cooperative Societies/Port Blair; Assistant
Commissioner of Police/Delhi; Deputy Superintendent of Police/Andaman &
Nicobar; Chief of Police/Dadra & Nagar Haveli etc.
70DANIPS   are   ‘Union   Territory   Services’19.   The   Affidavit   says,
“...at Serial 28 and 29 of the Schedule (to CCS Rules,
1965), we have the Union Territory Services known as
DANICS and DANIPS”. The Affidavit, further, says that,
“DANICS/DANIPS Officers are posted in Delhi; Andaman &
Nicobar Islands; Lakshadweep; Daman & Diu; Dadra &
Nagar Haveli. The recruitment to all the Union Territories
for   these   Group   B   posts   are   common.   They   are   also
centralised and the Appointing Authority is none other
than the Ministry of Home Affairs (Joint Secretary). For
the   recruitment   to   these  services,   it   is   the   very   same
examination meant for AIS and CCS Group A. Any citizen
of India is eligible to apply, subject to the conditions
prescribed.   As   per   the   Service   Rules,   transfer
undertakings   throughout   the  Union  Territories   covered
19 Page 4, Para (ii)(a) of the Affidavit.
71under DANICS/DANIPS is taken from these officers. This is
the   reason   why   the   Union   of   India   while   inviting
applications   for   recruitment   considers   all   candidates,
including reserved candidates on all India basis. Group B
Cadre of DANICS/DANIPS is the Feeder Cadre for IAS and
IPS respectively (i.e. AIS). They retire invariably in these
Offices,   some   of   them   reaching   high   positions   in   the
Central Government. Recruitment to AIS; CCS Group A;
CCS Group B (Gazetted) is conducted through UPSC. In the
Civil Services Examination, the applicants are common
when the applications are made. Every aspirant seeks
recruitment   to   the   services   and   it   is   only   as   per   the
marks and ranking that allocations are made eventually
to AIS; CCS Group A; CCS Group B. Therefore, when UPSC
undertakes the recruitment, it is naturally a pan India
72recruitment   and   therefore,   it   is   necessary   to   seek
applications including from reserved candidates from all
over India.”20  
53.But it is not the Members of the All India Services
(AGMUT Cadre); Central Civil Services (Group ‘A’ and ‘B’) and
the ‘DANICS’ and ‘DANIPS’ who alone are the public servants
in   the   States   and   the   Union   Territories   engaged   in   the
discharge of duties in connection with the affairs of the Union.
There   are   and   bound   to   be   public   servants   that   work   the
subordinate services. 
CCS Group C :
54.At   the   subordinate   level   these   are   the   Group   ‘C’
posts.  In the Schedule to CCS Rules, 1965, there are 5 such
services.   The   Union   of   India’s   Affidavit   says   that,   “ These
posts, in so far, as they relate to services under the Union
20 Page 4, 5 of the Affidavit.
73of   India   are   concerned   are   recruited   by   the   Staff
Selection   Commission   (which   is   the   Recruiting   Agency
under   the   DoPT).   The   members   of   CCS   Group   C   get
promoted to CCS Group B. Recruitment to posts in this
group   arise   out   of   requisition   made   by   the   concerned
ministries   all   over   India.   These   requisitions,   upon
reaching, the Staff Selection Commission are processed
and selection takes place and appointments are made.
Even from these appointees, undertaking for all India
transfer liability is taken. As these are posts under the
Central Government  and these employees are liable to
transferred anywhere in the country and the recruitment
being centralised for all such posts in the country, it has
been consistent policy of the Union of India to have pan
India eligibility .”  
7455.With regard to CCS Group D posts, in the affidavit of
the Union it is stated that “ the posts under this category are
primarily   of   what   used   to   be   Class   IV   employees   now
referred to as the Multi Tasking staff.   In recent years,
Central   Pay   Commission   has   recommended   against   any
further recruitment to these posts in Group D.  Further it
has also been recommended that the existing posts will be
merged   with   Group   C.   Hence,   this   is   now   a   vanishing
cadre21.”
56.The  broad  picture  that  emanates from the  above
discussion  and narration  is that insofar as the  services in
connection with the affairs of the Union is concerned (Central
Services), wherever the establishment may be located i.e. in the
National Capital Territory of Delhi or in a State or within the
21  Page 6, para  iv.a. of the Affidavit
75geographical   areas   of   Union   Territory,   recruitment   to   all
positions is on an All India basis and reservation provided for
is again a pan­ India reservation.   This by itself, from one
perspective, may appear to be in departure from the rule set
out in Part XVI of the Constitution of India (Articles 341 and
342).     However,   the   close   look   undertaken   hereinbefore
indicates   such   a   position   is   fully   in   accord   with   the
constitutional structure of a federal polity. 
NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY OF DELHI
57.In   case   of   National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi,
especially, to make the picture even clearer, a reference may be
made   to   ‘Delhi   Administration   Subordinate   Service   Rules,
1967’.  Rule 3 of the aforesaid Rules is to the following effect:
“3.Constitution   of   service   and   its
classification.­   (1)   On   and   from   the   date   of
commencement   of   these   Rules,   there   shall   be
constituted one Central Civil Service, known as the
Subordinate Service of the Delhi Administration .
(2)The Service shall have four Grades, namely—
76Grade I
Grade II
Grade III
Grade IV
(3)The posts in Grade I shall be Central Civil
posts, Class II Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) and those in
Grades II, III and IV shall be Central Civil posts
Group ‘C’ (Non­Gazetted) .
(4)Members of the service shall, in the normal
course   be   eligible   for   appointment   to   various
Grades of the service to which they belong and not
to the other service.”
(underlining is ours)
Subordinate services in the National Capital Territory of
Delhi are, therefore, clearly Central Civil Services. The Affidavit
of the Union also  points out this feature by stating that, “ The
posts in CCS Group C are in the subordinate services.   The
equivalent in the Union Territory of Delhi is the Delhi
Administrative   Subordinate   Services   (DASS)   and   the
Recruiting   Agency   in   the   place   of   Staff   Selection
Commission is the Delhi  Subordinate Service  Selection
Board   (DSSSB).   Members   of   the   Delhi   Administrative
77Subordinate Services are the Feeder Cadre for Central
Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It is for these reasons
that   the   policy   (of   pan   India   eligibility)   consistently
adopted.”22 
58.A combined reading of these provisions of the DASS
Rules,   1967   and   CCS   Rules,   1965,   therefore,   more   than
adequately explains the nature of Subordinate Services in the
NCT of Delhi.  These clearly are General Central Services and
perhaps, it is owing to this state of affairs that the Union of
India in its Affidavit has stated that, “ Members of the Delhi
Administrative Subordinate Services are the Feeder Cadre
for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It is for these
reasons   that   the   policy   (of   pan   India   eligibility)   is
consistently adopted .”
22 Page 6, Para (b) of the Affidavit. 
7859.While examining the validity of reservation of seats
in medical colleges for local candidates in Delhi, this Court in
Dr. Jagdish Saran and Others  Vs. Union of India23 had made
certain observations with regard to the special status that the
capital city enjoys, which today, has come to be known as the
National Capital Territory of Delhi.   The observations of this
Court in paragraphs 10 and 56 may be usefully recapitulated
and, therefore, is set out below:  
“10. The capital city is not just a part of India. It is
miniaturised India, a fact often forgotten by the
administration   in   the   field   of   culture   and
education, especially vis­a­vis regional, minorities.
It is magapolitan and people from all parts flock to
this outsized city. But we cannot exaggerate this
factor, for the presence of the farther regions like
the South and the North­east, population­wise, is
minimal   and   precarious.   Shri   Balakrishnan
insisted   that   the   University   was   sustained   by
Central Government  finances, collected from the
whole   country,   and   the   benefits   must   likewise
belong to all qualified students from everywhere.
These are valuable aspects to shape policy but the
23  (1980) 2 SCC 768
79court must test constitutionality and no more. To
that extent alone we will weigh these factors in
moulding our verdict.
xxx   xxx   xxx 
56.  We   may   wind­up   by   articulating   the   core
thought that vitalises our approach. Anyone who
lives   inside   India   can   never   be   considered   an
‘outsider’ in Delhi. The people in the States are
caught in a happy network of mutuality, woven
into a lovely garment of humanity, whose warp and
woof is India. This is the underlying fundamental
of   the   preambular   resolve   registered   in   our
National Parchment. So we insist that blind and
bigoted local patriotism in xenophobic exclusivism
is   destructive   of   our   Freedom   and   only   if
compelling   considerations   of   gross   injustice,
desperate   backwardness   and   glaring   inequality
desiderate such a purposeful course can protective
discrimination   gain   entrance   into   the   portals   of
college   campuses.   The   Administration   has   a
constitutional   responsibility   not   to   be   a   mere
thermometer   where   mercury   rises   with   populist
pressure but to be a thermostat that transforms
the mores of groups to stay in the conscience of the
nation viz. the Constitution.”
60.The Affidavit of the Union does not touch upon the
details   of   Subordinate   Services   in   other   Union   Territories.
80Neither the authorities of the other Union Territories have laid
before the Court any relevant material in this regard.   We,
therefore, refrain from addressing the issue in question as far
as other Union Territories are concerned and have confined
our   discussions   and   the   consequential   views   only   to   the
National Capital Territory of Delhi. 
61.Accordingly,   we   answer   the   question   referred   in
terms of the views expressed in para 34 of this opinion.  We
further hold that so far as the National Capital Territory of
Delhi is concerned the pan India Reservation Rule in force is in
accord   with   the   constitutional   scheme   relating   to   services
under the Union and the States/Union Territories.
62.In view of the conclusions reached as above, it will
not be necessary to remit Civil Appeal Nos. 1085 of 2013,
10081 of 2014, 8141 of 2014, 8802 of 2012, 1086 of 2013 and
Civil   Appeal   arising   out   of   Special   Leave   Petition   (Civil)
81No.36324   of   2017   (pertaining   to   Delhi)   for   further
consideration   by   the   appropriate   Bench.     Accordingly,   we
dispose of the said appeals (pertaining to Delhi) in terms of the
present order.
So far as Civil Appeal Nos.9935­9937 of 2014 pertaining
to the U.T. of Andaman and Nicobar Island are concerned the
issue may be decided by the appropriate Bench in the light of
the   views   expressed   herein   on   adequate   and   sufficient
materials   being   placed   before   the   Bench   by   the   contesting
parties.

Reference Order :-
I have gone through the judgment proposed by His Lordship
Justice Ranjan Gogoi. I agree with the following conclusions arrived
at in paras (30) and (34) and the reasonings thereon.
83""A person notified as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A' cannot claim
the same status in another State on the basis that he is declared as
a Scheduled Caste in State 'A'......"".
"".......It  will,  therefore,  be  in  consonance  with  the  constitutional
scheme to understand the enabling provision under Article 16(4) to
be available to provide reservation only to the classes or categories
of  Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  enumerated  in  the
Presidential orders for a particular State/Union Territory within the
geographical area of that State/Union Territory  (Union Territory
added by me) and not beyond.""
With due respect, I do not agree with the conclusion arrived at in para
(61) and the reasonings thereon.
“......So far as the National Capital Territory of Delhi is concerned
the  pan-India  Reservation  Rule  in  force  is  in  accord  with  the
constitutional scheme relating to services under the Union and the
States/Union Territories."" 
For agreeing with the conclusion arrived at in paras (30) and (34) and
for differing from the conclusions in para (61) and the reasonings
thereon, I have given my own reasonings.
2.The extent and nature of interplay and interaction under Articles
16(4), 341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution of India was referred to
the Constitution Bench in State of Uttaranchal v. Sandeep Kumar
Singh and Ors.,  (2010) 12 SCC 794, with the following reference:-
84""13. A very important question of law as to interpretation of Articles
16(4), 341 and 342 arises for consideration in this appeal. Whether
the Presidential Order issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1)
of the Constitution has any bearing on the State’s action in making
provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of
any Backward Class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is
not adequately represented in the services under the State? The
extent and nature of interplay and interaction among Articles 16(4),
341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution is required to be resolved.""
3.Territory  of  India:-  Article  1(1)  of  the  Constitution  of  India
declares that India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.  As
amended  by  the  Constitution  Seventh  (Amendment)  Act,  1956.
Article 1 of the Constitution reads as under:-
1.Name and territory of the Union .- (1) India, that is Bharat,
shall be a Union of States.
(2)  The  States  and  the  territories  thereof  shall  be  as
specified in the First Schedule.
(3) The territory of India shall comprise—
(a) the territories of the States;
(b) the Union Territories specified in the First Schedule; and
(c) such other territories as may be acquired.
4.Under the Constitution of India, as initially enacted, the States
were divided into Part A States, Part B States, Part C States and the
territories  in  Part  D.  Substantial  changes  were  made  by  the
Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 which incorporated the
recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission and was
85to have effect in concert with the States Reorganisation Act, 1956.
The  four  categories  of  States  that  existed  were  reduced  to  two
categories. The first of these categories - Part A and Part B States
comprised  one  class,  called  ""States"".  The  second  category
comprised the areas which had earlier been included in Part C and
Part D States; these areas were called ""Union Territories"". Some
additions and deletions were made to the existing lists.  Now as per
Schedule I, there are twenty-nine States and Seven Union Territories.
5.The expression “State” is not defined in the Constitution. It is
defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 which is made applicable to
the interpretation of the Constitution by Article 367. As on the date of
the commencement of the Constitution, clause (58) in Section 3 of
the General Clauses Act, 1897 defined “State” in the following words:-
“3. (58) ‘State’, — shall mean a Part A State, a Part B State or a
Part C State.”
The said definition was amended by the Adaptation of Laws Order
No.  1 of 1956 issued  by  the President in exercise of  the power
86conferred upon him by Article 372-A of the Constitution introduced by
the Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act,  1956.  The amended
definition 'State' reads thus:-
“3. (58) ‘State’, —
(a) as respects any period before the commencement of the
Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, shall mean a Part A
State, a Part B State or a Part C State; and
(b) as respects any period after such commencement, shall
mean a State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution and
shall include a Union Territory.”
6.Clause (30) in Article 366 defines the “Union Territory”  in the
following words:-
“366. (30) ‘Union Territory’  means any Union Territory specified in
the First Schedule and includes any other territory comprised with
the territory of India but not specified in that Schedule.”
7.Clause  (24)  of  Article  366  defines  “ Scheduled  Castes ”  and
clause  (25)  of  Article  366  defines  “ Scheduled  Tribes ”.  The  latter
means “such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within
such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to
be 'Scheduled Tribes' for the purposes of this Constitution ”. Article
341(1) of the Constitution empowers the President, in consultation
with  the  Governor  of  the  State  concerned,  to  specify  Scheduled
87Castes  by  public  notification.  Equally,  Article  342(1)  of  the
Constitution empowers the President “ with respect to any State or
Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the
Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal
communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities
which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be
'Scheduled Tribes' in relation to that State or Union Territory, as the
case  may  be ”.  Article  342(2)  of  the  Constitution  empowers
“Parliament,  by  law,  to  include  in  or  exclude  from  the  list  of
'Scheduled Tribes'  specified in a notification issued under clause (1),
any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or
tribal community, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under
the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification .”
Until  the  Presidential  Notification  is  modified  by  appropriate
amendment  by  Parliament  in exercise of the  power  under  Article
341(2) of the Constitution, the Presidential Notification issued under
Article 341(1) is final and conclusive and any caste or group cannot
be  added  to  it  or  subtracted  by  any  action  either  by  the  State
88Government or by a Court on adducing of evidence. In other words, it
is the constitutional mandate that the tribes or tribal communities or
parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities specified by
the  President,  after  consultation  with  the  Governor  in  the  public
notification, will be ' Scheduled Tribes ' subject to the law made by
Parliament alone, which may, by law, include in or exclude from the
list of 'Scheduled Tribes ' specified by the President. Thereafter, it
cannot be varied except by law made by the Parliament. 
8.The  President  of  India  alone  is  competent  or authorized  to
issue an appropriate Notification in terms of Article 341(1) and Article
342(1). Cumulative reading of Articles 338, 341 and 342 indicate
that:-
a)Only  the  President  could  notify  castes/tribes  as
Scheduled Castes/Tribes and also indicate conditions
attaching to such declaration. A public Notification by
the President specifying the particular castes or tribes
as SC/ST shall be final for the purpose of Constitution
and shall be exhaustive.
89b)Once  a  notification  is  issued  under  clause  (1)  of
Articles  341  and  342  of  the  Constitution,  the
Parliament can by law include in or exclude from the
list  of  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled  Tribes,
specified in the notification, any caste or tribe but
save for that limited purpose the notification issued
under  clause  (1),  shall  not  be  varied  by  any
subsequent notification24. 
9.It is stated that before notification was issued under          Article
341(1) and Article 342(1) notifying certain caste/race or group as
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe, an elaborate enquiry was made
and also after such enquiry, the Presidential Order was issued. While
doing so, Presidential Order not only specified parts or groups of
caste,  races  or  tribes  but  also  made  the  said  specification  by
reference  to  different  areas  in  the  State.  By  perusal  of  the
Presidential Order, it is clear that some caste/race is actually confined
with  reference  to  a  particular  area;  for  instance,  confined  to  a
particular  taluk  in a district. The reason for such specification by
reference to different areas in the State being educational, social

Tribes in the State of Maharashtra and Anr. v. Union of India  (UOI) and Anr. (1994) 5 SCC 244.
90backwardness, races or tribes cannot be the same throughout the
State. The consideration for specifying a particular caste or tribe or
class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes or Backward Classes in a given State would depend on the
nature and extent of the disadvantages and social hardships suffered
in that State. These may be absent in another State to which these
persons belonging to other States may migrate.
10. Whenever  States'  reorganization  took  place  in  the  past,
Parliament exercised its powers under Articles 341(2) and 342(2) and
provided for specific Castes/Tribes that had to be Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes  in relation to the  reorganized  States/Union
Territories.  The  Constitution  Scheduled  Caste  Orders  and  the
Constitution Scheduled Castes (Union Territories) Order, also clarify
that Parliament's intention was to extend benefits of reservation in
relation to the States/Union Territories in terms of the castes, races or
tribes mentioned as per the Presidential Orders themselves.
9111.Presidential  Order  which  provided  for  castes/races,  tribes
recognized  as  ' Scheduled  Caste/Scheduled  Tribe'  and  their
interpretation cannot be challenged or agitated in a court of law. The
question whether Dohar caste is a sub-caste of Chamar caste which
is recognized as a Scheduled Caste came up for consideration in
Bhaiya Lal v. Harikishan Singh , AIR 1965 SC 1557, wherein this
Court held that the court cannot enquire into whether Dohar caste is a
sub-caste of Chamar caste and whether the same must be deemed
to have been included in the Presidential Order. In  Bhaiya Lal's
case,  this Court held  ""...that before a notification is issued under
Article 341(1), an elaborate enquiry is made and it is as a result of
this enquiry that social justice is sought to be done to the castes,
races or tribes as may appear to be necessary, and in doing justice... ”
and while doing so, the notification not only to specify parts or groups
of castes, races or tribes but to make specification by reference to
different areas in the State.  In  Bhaiya Lal's case,  the Supreme
Court  held  that  only  the  Parliament  is  empowered  to  amend  the
92Notification under Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution.
12.Presidential  Notification  (Scheduled  Caste)  Order  1950:-
The  List  of  Scheduled  Castes  is  contained  in  the  Constitution
(Scheduled Castes) Order 1950.  The Presidential Notifications of
1950 and 1951 (as amended) in relation to Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes of various States, very importantly provided that:-
""2.  Subject to the provisions of this Order, the castes, races or
tribes or parts of, or groups within, castes or tribes specified in
[Parts I to XXV] of the Schedule to this Order shall, in relation to the
States to which those Parts respectively relate, be deemed to be
Scheduled Castes  so far as regards members thereof resident in
the localities specified in relation to them respectively in those Parts
of that Schedule.""
The  Presidential  Notification  of  1950  was  amended  by  the
Constitution  (Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  Order),
Amendment Act, 1956, (Act No.63 of 1956).  Another amending Act
was enacted by Parliament in 1976.  Further, amendments had taken
place  as  and  when  Parliament  reorganized  States  like  Bombay,
Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand through
separate Acts. All these were Parliamentary enactments. Presidential
93Notification pertaining to Union Territories, Scheduled Castes (Union
Territories) Order, 1951 specifies Scheduled Castes resident in the
Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Daman and Diu.   When
new Union Territories were formed such as Pondicherry, Sikkim, Goa,
Daman and Diu, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, the Scheduled Castes
or Scheduled Tribes  Orders  were made  in relation  to  those  new
Union Territories. 
13.The  Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  Order,  195025:-  In
exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 342 of the
Constitution of India the President has, after consultation with the
Governors  of  the  States  concerned,  made  the  Constitution
(Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, specifying the tribes or communities
which  shall  be  deemed  to  be  Scheduled  Tribes  in  the  States
mentioned therein.  This Order has been amended by the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act
25 Ref. Election Manual (1984), p.44 quoted in Commentary on the Constitution of India 8th 
Ed. by Durga Das Basu.
94No.108  of  1976),  the  Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  Order
(Amendment) Act, 1991 (16 of 1991), the Constitution (Scheduled
Tribes)  Order  (Second  Amendment)  Act,  1991  (39  of  1991),  the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act,
2002  (32  of  2002),  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes
Orders  (Amendment)  Act,  2002  (10  of  2003),  the  Constitution
(Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act, 2003 (47 of 2003), the
Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act 2006 (48 of
2006), the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act,
2008 (14 of 2008) and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Union
Territories Order (Amendment) Act, 2008 (2 of 2009).  As it stands
amended, it specifies the Scheduled Tribes resident in the States of
Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Gujarat,  Himachal  Pradesh,
Karnataka,  Kerala,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Manipur,
Meghalaya, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, West Bengal.
14.Article 16(4) is only an enabling provision to provide reservation
95to  backward  classes. Clause (4)  of  Article 16 of  the  Constitution
cannot be made applicable for the purpose of grant of benefit of
reservation for Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in a State or
Union Territory, who have migrated to another State or Union Territory
and they are not members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in the State to which they have migrated. The Presidential
Orders made under Article 341 and Article 342 have an overriding
status.  The  presence  of  Articles  338,  338A,  341,  342  of  the
Constitution clearly shows that it precludes any tinkering or deviation
from the list of castes or tribes notified in the Presidential Order which
are reserved for that State or that Union territory.
15.India is huge.  There is Unity in Diversity .  Diversity in terms of
language, culture, demography, geographical area, development of
regions, opportunities available to individuals for education and to
make social and economical advancement etc. Some States are well-
developed; some other States are developing; few other States are
96under-developed.  All the affirmative action of the States is to provide
equality  of  opportunity  to  the  socially  and  economically
disadvantaged group. Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, State is
empowered to make special provisions for the advancement of any
socially  and  educationally  backward  class  of  citizens  or  for  the
Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes.  Article 16 of the Constitution
of India lays down that there shall be equality of opportunity for all
citizens  in matters  relating  to  employment  or appointment to any
office under the State.  Article 16(4) of the Constitution empowers the
State  to  make  provisions  to  provide  reservation  to  the  backward
classes in employment or appointment to any posts and thereby to
create equally opportunities for their socio-economic empowerment
and  their  emancipation.  Article  16(4)  speaks  of  one  type  of
reservation namely reservation of appointments/posts.
16.Article  16(4)  of  the  Constitution  is  an  enabling  provision
directed towards achieving equality of opportunity in services under
the State.  Observing that Article 14 of the Constitution is the genus
97while Article 16 is the species, in E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil
Nadu and Anr. , (1974) 4 SCC 3, it was held that:-
""85.  .........Article  16  embodies  the  fundamental  guarantee  that
there  shall  be  equality  of  opportunity  for  all  citizens  in  matters
relating  to  employment  or  appointment  to  any  office  under  the
State. Though enacted as a distinct and independent fundamental
right  because  of  its  great  importance  as  a  principle  ensuring
equality of opportunity in public employment which is so vital to the
building up of the new classless egalitarian society envisaged in the
Constitution, Article 16 is only an instance of the application of the
concept of equality enshrined in Article 14. In other words, Article
14 is the genus while Article 16 is a species. Article 16 gives effect
to  the  doctrine  of  equality  in  all  matters  relating  to  public
employment.  The  basic  principle  which,  therefore,  informs  both
Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination.
Now,  what  is  the  content  and  reach  of  this  great  equalising
principle? It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose. J., “a way
of  life”,  and  it  must  not  be  subjected  to  a  narrow  pedantic  or
lexicographic approach. We cannot countenance any attempt to
truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would
be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept
with  many  aspects  and  dimensions  and  it  cannot  be  “cribbed,
cabined and confined” within traditional and doctrinaire limits ........""

17.The Constitution Bench of nine Judges in Indra Sawhney and
Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. , (1992) Supp 3 SCC 217, observed
that Article 16(4) of the Constitution is aimed at ' protective equality '
and it was held as under:-
""563. Thus, Article 16(1) and (4) operate in the same field.  Both are
directed towards achieving equality of opportunity in services under
98the State.  One is broader in sweep and expansive in reach.  Other
is limited in approach and narrow in applicability.  Former applies to
'all' citizens whereas latter is available to 'any' in Article 16(4) read
together indicate that they are part of same scheme.  The one is
substantive equality and other is protective equality.  Article 16(1) is
fundamental right of a citizen whereas Article 16(4) is an obligation
of the State.  The former is enforceable in a Court of law, whereas
the  latter  is  'not  constitutional  compulsion'  but  an  enabling
provision.  Whether Article 16(4) is in substance, 'an exception', 'a
proviso', or an 'emphatic way of putting the extent to which equality
of  opportunity  could  be  carried',  or  'presumed  to  exhaust  all
exceptions in favour of backward class', or 'expressly designed as
benign discrimination devoted to lifting to backward classes', but if
Article 16(1) is the positive aspect of equality of opportunity', Article
16(4) is a complete Code for reservation for backward class of
citizens as it not only provides for exercise of power but also lays
down the circumstances, in which the power can be exercised, and
the purpose and extent or its exercise.  One is mandatory and
operates  automatically  whereas  the  other  comes  into  play  on
identification of backward class of citizens and their inadequate
representation.""  [Underlining added ]
18.Article 16(4) of the Constitution is not an exception; but a facet
of Article 14 and Article 16(1) of the Constitution; it enables the State
to effectuate equality of opportunity to any backward class. As held in
Chattar Singh and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. (1996) 11
SCC 742 in paras (17) and (18), that "".... It gives power to the state to
effectuate  the  opportunity  of  equality  to  any  backward  class  of
citizens.  ……..The object of reservation for the Scheduled Casts and
99Scheduled Tribes is to bring them into the mainstream of national life,
while the objective in respect of the backward classes is to remove
their social and educational handicaps. Therefore, they are always
treated dissimilar and they do not form an integrated class with Dalits
and Tribes for the purpose of Article 16(4) or 15 (4)..."".
19.In State of Kerala and Anr. v. N.M. Thomas and Ors. (1976) 2
SCC 310 in para (178), it was held that ""... differences and disparities
exist among men and things and they cannot be treated alike by the
application of the same laws but the law has to come in terms with
life  and  must  be  able  to  recognize  the  genuine  differences  and
disparities that exist in human nature.  Legislature has also to enact
legislation to meet specific ends by making a reasonable and rational
classification.."".
20.A Constitution Bench of this Court in Marri Chandra Shekhar
Rao v. Dean, Seth G.S. Medical College and Ors. , (1990) 3 SCC
100130  had  the  occasion  to  consider  the  question  as  to  whether  a
member of Gouda community which is recognised as “ Scheduled
Tribe” in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 would be
entitled to admission in a medical institution situated in the State of
Maharashtra.  Based  on  the  Government  of  India  circular  dated
22.02.1985,  the  appellant  was  denied  admission  to  the  Medical
College on the ground that Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao was not a
‘Scheduled Tribe’ in the migrated State i.e. State of Maharashtra.
21.After referring  to various  provisions of Constitution  of India,
background in which the Presidential Order was issued and earlier
judgments, in  Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case , it was held as
under:-
""9. It appears that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in some
States had to suffer the social disadvantages and did not have the
facilities for development and growth. It is, therefore, necessary in
order to  make them  equal in  those areas where  they  have  so
suffered  and  are  in  the  state  of  underdevelopment  to  have
reservations or protection in their favour so that they can compete
on equal terms with the more advantageous or developed sections
of  the  community.  Extreme  social  and  economic  backwardness
arising  out  of  traditional  practices  of  untouchability  is  normally
considered  as  criterion  for  including  a  community  in  the  list  of
101Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The social conditions of a
caste, however, varies from State to State and it will not be proper
to  generalise  any  caste  or  any  tribe  as  a  Scheduled  Tribe  or
Scheduled Caste for the whole country. This, however, is a different
problem whether a member or the Scheduled Caste in one part of
the  country  who  migrates  to  another  State  or  any  other  Union
territory should continue to be treated as a Scheduled Caste or
Scheduled Tribe in which he has migrated. That question has to be
judged taking into consideration the interest and well-being of the
Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  in  the  country  as  a
whole.""
22.Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao case  was followed by another
Constitution Bench of this Court in Action Committee on issue of
caste certificate to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in
the State of Maharashtra and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr.
(1994) 5 SCC 244.   In  Action Committee's case,  it was held as
under:-
""3. On a plain reading of clause (1) of Articles 341 and 342 it is
manifest that the power of the President is limited to specifying the
castes or tribes which shall, for the purposes of the Constitution, be
deemed to be Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in relation to
a State or a Union Territory, as the case may be. Once a notification
is  issued  under  clause  (1)  of  Articles  341  and  342  of  the
Constitution, Parliament can by law include in or exclude from the
list  of  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled  Tribes,  specified  in  the
notification, any caste or tribe but save for that limited purpose the
notification issued under clause (1), shall not be varied by any
subsequent  notification.  What  is  important  to  notice  is  that  the
castes or tribes have to be specified in relation to a given State or
102Union  Territory.  That  means  a  given  caste  or  tribe  can  be  a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in relation to the State or
Union Territory for which it is specified.  These are the relevant
provisions with which we shall be concerned while dealing with the
grievance made in this petition.
....
16. We  may  add  that  considerations  for  specifying  a  particular
caste  or  tribe  or  class  for  inclusion  in  the  list  of  Scheduled
Castes/Schedule Tribes or backward classes in a given State would
depend  on  the  nature  and  extent  of  disadvantages  and  social
hardships suffered by that caste, tribe or class in that State which
may be totally non est in another State to which persons belonging
thereto may migrate. Coincidentally it may be that a caste or tribe
bearing the same nomenclature is specified in two States but the
considerations on the basis of which they have been specified may
be totally different. So also the degree of disadvantages of various
elements which constitute the input for specification may also be
totally  different.  Therefore,  merely  because  a  given  caste  is
specified in State A as a Scheduled Caste does not necessarily
mean that if there be another caste bearing the same nomenclature
in  another  State  the  person  belonging  to  the  former  would  be
entitled  to  the  rights,  privileges  and  benefits  admissible  to  a
member  of  the  Scheduled  Caste  of  the  latter  State  “for  the
purposes of this Constitution”. This is an aspect which has to be
kept  in  mind  and  which  was  very  much  in  the  minds  of  the
Constitution-makers as is evident from the choice of language of
Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution....""
Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case and Action Committee's case
were followed in Subhash Chandra and Anr. v. Delhi Subordinate
Services  Selection  Board  and  Ors. ,  (2009)  15  SCC  458.   In
Subhash Chandra case, the Supreme Court reiterated that “ If a caste
or tribe is notified in terms of the Scheduled Castes Order or the
103Scheduled Tribes Order, the same must be done in terms of clause
(1) of Article 341 as also that of Article 342 of the Constitution of
India, as the case may be. No deviation from the procedure laid down
therein is permissible in law. If any amendment/alteration thereto is
required to be made, recourse to the procedure laid down under
clause (2) thereof must be resorted to.""
23.In  Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case , it was held that a
Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe of any State which depends on
the nature and extent of disadvantages and social hardships suffered
by the caste, tribe or class in that State or area may be non-existent
in another State.  The inclusion of the castes, races or tribes is mainly
based on the degree of disadvantages or hardships faced by the
castes, races or tribes in that State or in some cases or in part area of
the State.  For instance, in the Presidential Order relating to the State
of Tamil Nadu, the caste Kanikaran, Kanikkar  (in Kanyakumari District
and Shenkottah and Ambasaundram taluks of Tirunelveli district) are
notified as Scheduled Castes.  This shows that the President can
104specify castes, races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to
the entire State but in relation to the parts of the State.  The President
has been authorised to limit the notification to parts of the State or
groups within castes, races or tribes.  In  Marri Chandra Shekhar
Rao case, the Constitution Bench therefore held that the expression
“in relation to that State” must be read meaningfully; otherwise the
expression “in relation to that State” would come nugatory.
24.The  Presidential  Order  issued  under  Article  341  of  the
Constitution in regard to Scheduled Castes and Article 342 of the
Constitution  in  regard  to  Scheduled  Tribes  cannot  be  varied  by
anyone  or by the  Court.   Only the  Parliament  by law include  or
exclude  from  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled  Tribes
specified  in  a  notification  issued  under  Article  341(1)  and  Article
342(1) of the Constitution respectively any caste, race or tribe or
parts or group within any caste, race or tribe.  The Scheduled Castes
or Scheduled Tribes thus specified in relation to one State or Union
Territory  does  not  carry  their  status  in  another  State  or  Union
105Territory.   When  the  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled  Tribes  are
specified for each State and in some cases, specific areas of the
State or Union Territory, neither the State legislature nor the courts
can include or exclude other Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes
so  specified  in  some  States  or  Union  Territories  which  would  be
against the mandate of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution and
the Presidential Orders issued thereon.  If that is permitted, it would
amount to addition or alteration of the Presidential Order which is
violative of the Constitutional Scheme.  
25.State of Maharashtra v. Milind and Ors.  (2001) 1 SCC 4,
dealt with a question as to whether the notified Scheduled Tribe being
Halba or Halbi as contained in item 19 of the Presidential Order
would include ""Halba-Koshti"". This Court held that addition of ""Halba-
Koshti"" in the Presidential Order would amount to amendment thereto
which  is impermissible  in law.   In  Milind's  case ,  it was held as
under:-
""33......The  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  would  be  much  more
restricted while dealing with the question whether a particular caste
or tribe would come within the purview of the notified Presidential
106Order, considering the language of Articles 341 and 342 of the
Constitution. These being the parameters and in the case in hand,
the  Committee  conducting  the  inquiry  as  well  as  the  Appellate
Authority,  having  examined  all  relevant  materials  and  having
recorded a finding that Respondent 1 belonged to “Koshti” caste
and has no identity with “Halba/Halbi” which is the Scheduled Tribe
under Entry 19 of the Presidential Order, relating to the State of
Maharashtra, the High Court exceeded its supervisory jurisdiction
by  making  a  roving  and  in-depth  examination  of  the  materials
afresh and in coming to the conclusion that “Koshtis” could be
treated as “Halbas”. In this view the High Court could not upset the
finding of fact in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. Hence, we have to
essentially answer Question 2 also in the negative. Hence it is
answered accordingly.""
26.When  the  Parliament  restricts  the  benefit  of  reservation  by
inclusion of a caste as a Scheduled Caste to a State or part of State
i.e. certain specified districts in a State, the Court cannot express any
opinion as  to  its  correctness.   Hence,  as  regards  the   inclusion of
caste “Mochi”  in  the  list of  Scheduled Castes within a   particular
area  as  per  Constitution  (Scheduled  Castes)  Order
(Second Amendment)  Act,  2002, it  was  held  that  it  was  not  for
the Court to render any opinion in regard to the correctness of the
same.   [vide  Shree   Surat   Valsad   Jilla   K.M.G.
Parishad v. Union of India and Ors.  (2007) 5 SCC 360].
10727.The  executive instructions/circulars issued by the Government
of  India  also  reiterate  to  well-settled  position.  The  circular
No. BC-16014/1/82-SC & BCD-I dated 06.08.1984 of the Ministry of
Home  Affairs  addressed  to  all  State  Governments  and  UT
Administration states  that  SC and ST on migration from  the  State
of his origin to another State will not lose  his status as SC/ST;
but will be entitled to the concession/benefits admissible to the SC/ST
from the State of his origin  and  not  from the State where he has
migrated. The relevant portion of the said circular reads as under:-
No. BC-16014/1/82-SC & BCD-I
Government of India/Bharat Sarkar
Ministry of Home Affairs/GrihMantralaya
New Delhi, the 6th August, 1984
To,
The Chief Secretaries of All State
Governments and U.T. Administrations.
Subject:  -  Verification  of  claim  of  candidates  belonging  to
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and migrants from
other States/Union Territories-Form of certificate-Amendment
to.
Sir,
……..
2.The  instructions  issued  in  this  Ministry’s  letter  of  even
number dated the 18.11.1982 will continue. It is, however, clarified
that  the  Scheduled  Caste/Scheduled  Tribe  person  on  migration
from the State of his origin to another State will not lose his status
as Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes but he will be entitled to the
108concessions/benefits  admissible  to  the  Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes from the State of his origin and not from
the State where he has migrated……               (Underlining added )
Yours faithfully
Sd/-
Joint Secretary to Govt. of India
28.The same thing was reiterated in the circular dated 22.02.1985
issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs which has also clarified that a
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe person who has migrated from the
State  of  origin  to  some  other  State  for  the  purpose  of  seeking
education,  employment,  etc.  will  be  deemed  to  be  a  Scheduled
Caste/Tribe of the State of his origin and will be entitled to derive
benefits from the State of origin and not from the State to which he
has migrated.
29.My  Conclusion for agreeing with the view taken in paras
(30) and (32):-  It is now settled law that a person belonging to
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in State 'A' cannot claim the same
status in another State 'B' on the ground that he is declared as a
109Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in State 'A'.  The expressions "" in
relation to that State or Union Territory "" and ""for the purpose of this
Constitution"" used in Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India
are to be meaningfully interpreted.  A given caste or tribe can be a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State or
Union Territory for which it is specified.  Thus, the person notified as a
Scheduled Caste in State 'A' cannot claim the same status in another
State on the basis that he was declared Scheduled Caste in State 'A'.
Article 16(4) has to yield to the Constitutional mandate of Articles 341
and 342.
Union Territories :
30.Part VIII of the Constitution of India deals with Union Territories.
Article 239 provides that the Union Territory shall be administered by
the President acting through an Administrator to be appointed by him.
Article 239 reads as follows:-
“239. Administration of Union Territories
(1) Save as otherwise provided by Parliament by law, every Union
Territory shall be administered by the President acting,  to such
110extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by
him with such designation as he may specify.
(2)Notwithstanding anything contained in Part VI, the President
may appoint the Governor of a State as the administrator of an
adjoining Union Territory, and where a Governor is so appointed, he
shall exercise his functions as such administrator independently of
his Council of Ministers.”
31.Article  239A  was  inserted  by  the  Constitution  (Fourteenth
Amendment) Act, 1962.  Article 239A of the Constitution of India
empowers the Parliament to create by law legislatures and Council of
Ministers in the then Union Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur,
Goa,  Daman  &  Diu  and  Pondicherry.   Arunachal  Pradesh  and
Mizoram were added later.  With Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura,
Goa and Mizoram all becoming full-fledged States, the only Union
Territory left under Article 239A is Pondicherry.  Now, Union Territory
of Pondicherry (Puducherry) also has a legislature and Council of
Ministers.
32.Article 341 empowers the President “with respect to any State
or Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the
111Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the castes, races or
tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes which shall
for the purposes of this Constitution, be deemed to be Scheduled
Caste in relation to that State or Union Territory as the case may be.”
Equally Article 342(1) empowers the President “with respect to any
State or Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation
with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the tribes or
tribal  communities  or  parts  of  or  groups  within  tribes  or  tribal
communities  which  shall  for  the  purposes  of  the  Constitution  be
deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State or Union
Territory, as the case may be”.  Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the
Constitution  empower  the  Parliament  alone  by  law  to  include  or
exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes specified
by  notification  issued  under  Articles  341(1)  and  342(1)  of  the
Constitution of India.  Until the Presidential Notification is modified by
appropriate amendment by Parliament in exercise of the power under
Articles  341(2)  or  342(2)  of  the  Constitution,  the  Presidential
Notification  issued  under  Articles  341(1)  and  342(1)  of  the
112Constitution is final and conclusive.  No caste or group can be added
to it or subtracted by any action either by the State Government or by
a  Court  on  adducing  of  evidence.   Articles  341  and  342  of  the
Constitution do not make any distinction between a ‘State’ or ‘Union
Territory’.
33.Constitution (Scheduled Castes) (Union Territories) Order,
1951:-  In exercise of powers under Clause (1) of Articles 341 and
342 of the Constitution, the Presidential Notifications were issued
specifying Scheduled Castes in relation to various Union Territories.
List  of  Scheduled  Castes  are  declared  in  relation  to  each  Union
Territory  separately.   Presidential  Notification  pertaining  to  Union
Territories,  Scheduled  Castes  (Union  Territories)  Order,  1951
specifies Scheduled Castes resident in the Union Territories of Delhi,
Chandigarh and Daman and Diu.  The Presidential Order provided
that:-
""Subject to the provisions of this Order, the castes, races or tribes
or parts of, or groups within, castes or tribes, specified in *[Parts I to
113III] of the Schedule to this Order shall, in relation to the *[Union
territories] to which those parts respectively relate, be deemed to
be Scheduled Castes so far as regards members thereof resident
in the localities specified in relation to them respectively in those
Parts of that Schedule .""
As  and  when  there  is  reorganisation  of  the  Union  Territories,  in
exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  under  Article  341(1)  of  the
Constitution, the President has made various orders.
34.The  Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  (Union  Territories)
Order, 195126:-  In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of
Article  342  of  the  Constitution  of  India,  as  amended  by  the
Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, the President made the
Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  (Part  C  States)  Order,  1951,
specifying the tribes or communities which shall be deemed to be
'Scheduled Tribes’ in Part C State.  This Order was adapted for the
Union Territories  by  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes
Lists (Modification) Order, 1956.

by Durga Das Basu.
11435.When  new  territories  were  formed,  such  as  Pondicherry
(Puducherry), or Sikkim, the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes
Orders were made in relation to the new territories. In exercise of the
powers under Articles 341(1) and 342(1), the President has made the
orders  -  The  Constitution  (Dadra  and  Nagar  Haveli)  Scheduled
Castes  Order,  1962;  The  Constitution  (Dadra  and  Nagar  Haveli)
Scheduled  Tribes  Order,  1962;  The  Constitution  (Pondicherry)
Scheduled Castes Order, 1964; The Constitution (Goa, Daman and
Diu) Scheduled Caste Order, 1968; The Constitution (Goa, Daman
and Diu) Scheduled Tribes Order, 1968; In the case of Goa, the Goa,
Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act, 1987 (Act No.18 of 1987), by
Section 19 amended the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
Orders.
36.Union Territories do not become merged with the Central
Government:-  The Union Territories are centrally administered by the
115President acting through an administrator.  As held by this Court in
New Delhi Municipal Council v. State of Punjab & Ors.  (1997) 7
SCC  339,  the  President,  who  is  the  executive  head  of  a  Union
Territory while administering the Union Territory, does not function as
the head of the Central Government, but as the head of the Union
Territory under powers specially vested in him under Article 239 of the
Constitution  thereby  occupying  a  position  analogous  to  that  of  a
Governor  in  a  State.  Though  the  Union  Territories  are  centrally
administered under the provisions of Article 239, they do not become
merged with the Central Government as has been held by this Court
in Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev and Ors.  AIR 1954 SC 587.
They are centrally administered; but they retain their independent
identity [Chandigarh Administration and Anr. v. Surinder Kumar
and Ors. (2004) 1 SCC 530]. The Union Territory does not entirely
lose its existence as an entity though large control is exercised by the
Union of India. [ Government of NCT Delhi v. All India Central Civil
Accounts, Jao's Association and Ors. (2002) 1 SCC 344]
11637.     View taken in Pushpa and Chandigarh Administration – not
correct  view:-   Reliance  was  placed  upon  Pushpa’s  case  to
contend that Article 16(4) is not controlled by the Presidential Order
issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1) to the Officers appointed
to the post in the Union Territories need not be confined to only such
Schedule Castes/Schedule Tribes of the particular Union Territory. In
Pushpa’s case , the Supreme Court was confined with the question
as to whether, selection and appointment already made to migrants’
Schedule  Caste  candidates  of  other  States  against  the  quota
reserved for the Schedule Caste candidates in the Union Territory of
Pondicherry  was  legal  and  valid.  In  S.  Pushpa  and  Ors.  v.
Shivachanmugavelu  and  Ors.  (2005)  3  SCC  1 ,  Pondicherry
Government appointed Selection Grade Teachers in 1995 under the
Scheduled  Castes  quota  not  only  from  the  Scheduled  Castes
candidates of Pondicherry but also such candidates of Scheduled
Castes from other States.  In Pushpa's case , this Court upheld the
policy  of  the  Pondicherry  Government  extending  the  benefit  of
reservation of SC/ST seats even to those candidates who came from
117other States.  The Pondicherry Government proceeded on the basis
that  since  Central  Government  jobs  were  open  to  all  SC/ST
candidates irrespective of origin of their States, the same may apply
to jobs with a Union Territory as well. In Pushpa's case , this Court
held that in the matter of providing reservation, it was open to the
Pondicherry  Government  to  extend  the  benefit  of  reservation  to
migrant Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates and that
the same will not be an infraction of clause (4) of Article 16 of the
Constitution of India.
38.In  Pushpa's  case ,  the  principle  that  “ when  members  of
Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes migrate to another State, they
do not carry with them the special privileges and advantages ”, was
held  not  applicable  in  case  of  Union  Territories.  In  para  (21)  of
Pushpa's case , it was held as under:-
""21.....Article 16(4) is not controlled by a Presidential Order issued
under  Article  341(1)  or  Article  342(1)  of  the  Constitution  in  the
sense that reservation in the matter of appointment on posts may
be made in a State or Union Territory only for such Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes which are mentioned in the Schedule
118appended  to  the  Presidential  Order  for  that  particular  State  or
Union Territory. This article does not say that only such Scheduled
Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  which  are  mentioned  in  the
Presidential  Order issued for  a particular  State alone would be
recognised as backward classes of citizens and none else. If a
State or Union Territory makes a provision whereunder the benefit
of  reservation  is  extended  only  to  such  Scheduled  Castes  or
Scheduled Tribes which are recognised as such in relation to that
State or Union Territory then such a provision would be perfectly
valid. However, there would be no infraction of clause (4) of Article
16  if  a  Union  Territory  by  virtue  of  its  peculiar  position  being
governed by the President as laid down in Article 239 extends the
benefit of reservation even to such migrant Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled Tribes who are not mentioned in the Schedule to the
Presidential  Order  issued  for  such  Union  Territory.  The  UT  of
Pondicherry having adopted a policy of the Central Government
whereunder all Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, irrespective
of their State are eligible for posts which are reserved for SC/ST
candidates, no legal infirmity can be ascribed to such a policy and
the same cannot be held to be contrary to any provision of law .""
(Underlining added )
In my considered view, the above observation in Pushpa's case  is
not a correct view.  The judgment in Pushpa's case is contrary to the
views taken in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case.  The judgment
in Pushpa's case is contrary to the views taken in Marri Chandra
Shekhar  Rao's  case.  Facts  of  Pushpa’s  case  disclose  that  the
Government of Pondicherry had throughout proceeded on the basis
that being a Union Territory all orders regarding reservation for SC/ST
in  respect  of  post/services  under  the  Central  Government  were
119applicable to post/services as under the Pondicherry administration.
The decision in Pushpa’s case  therefore cannot be taken to be an
authoritative  pronouncement.   Clause  (2)  of  Article  341  of  the
Constitution empowers Parliament alone by law to include or exclude
from the lists of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued
under clause (1) of Article 341.  No executive action or order or
modification  or  variance  of  the  same  is  possible  and  any  such
variance would be against the constitutional scheme.   
39.In  Pushpa's  case ,  the  posts  advertised  were  of  Selection
Grade Teachers under the Pondicherry Services and not for Central
Government jobs. It may be that Pondicherry is a Union Territory; but
the  posts/services  exclusively  coming  under  Pondicherry
administration  is  meant  only  for  the  Scheduled  Casts/Scheduled
Tribes as notified under the Presidential Order for Pondicherry.  In
fact,  Pondicherry  (Union  Territory)  itself  by  referring  to  Subhash
Chandra's case has taken the decision that reservation benefits to
posts/services arising under the Union Territory of Pondicherry will be
120confined only to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes notified by
virtue  of  Presidential  Order.  The  said  Government  Order  of  the
Pondicherry Government was upheld by this Court in  Puducherry
Scheduled Caste People Welfare Association v. Chief Secretary
to Government, Union Territory of Pondicherry and Ors. (2014) 9
SCC 236, wherein this Court held as under:-
""13. It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  it  is  by  virtue  of  the
notification of President under Article 341(1) that the Scheduled
Castes come into being. The members of the Scheduled Castes
are drawn from castes, races or tribes, they attain a new status by
virtue of Presidential Order. Clause (2) of Article 341 empowers
Parliament  alone  by  law  to  include  or  exclude  from  the  list  of
Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause (1)
by the President. By no executive power, amendment, modification,
alteration or variance in the Presidential Order is permissible.  It is
not open to the executive to do anything directly or indirectly which
may  lead  to  any  change  in  the  Presidential  Order.  Once
Presidential Order has been issued under Article 341(1) or Article
342(1), any amendment in the Presidential Order can only be made
by Parliament by law as provided in Article 341(2) or Article 342(2),
as the case may be, and in no other manner. The interpretation of
“resident” in the Presidential Order as “of origin” amounts to altering
the Presidential Order.""
40.The principle in Pushpa's case  was not accepted in Subhash
Chandra's  case .  It  was  held  that  although  Union  Territory  is
administered by the Union Government, socio-political aspect of the
121Union Territory cannot be mixed up with administrative aspect. In
Subhash Chandra's case,  it was held that if the principle applied in
Pushpa's  case is to be given a logical extension, it will lead to an
absurdity, that the Scheduled Castes Order in a State/Union Territory
brought under the control of the President under Article 341 of the
Constitution  could  be  altered  by  virtue  of  a  notification  issued  in
pursuance  of  Article  16(4)  of  the  Constitution,  which  is  not  in
consonance with the Constitutional Scheme.
41.Let us refer to the facts of  Chandigarh Administration and
Another v. Surinder Kumar and Others (2004) 1 SCC 530. Ministry
of  Home  Affairs,  Government  of  India  issued  various  circulars
pertaining  to  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes.  The
circular  dated  22.02.1985  regarding  "" Issue  of  Scheduled
Caste/Scheduled Tribe certificate to migrants from other States/Union
Territories"", issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs clarified that a
Scheduled Caste/Tribe person who has migrated from the State of
122origin to some other State for the purpose of seeking education,
employment, etc. will be deemed to be a Scheduled Caste/Tribe of
the State of his origin and will be entitled to derive benefits from the
State of origin and not from the State to which he has migrated.
Based on the aforesaid circular of the Government of India, the Home
Secretary, Chandigarh Administration vide his letter dated 28.07.1986
sought clarification from the Government of India, Ministry of Home
Affairs, as to whether, these instructions are applicable in the Union
Territory of Chandigarh. Chandigarh Administration received the reply
dated 26.08.1986 from Ministry of Welfare stating that there is no
discrimination  in  the  employment  under  the  Central  Government
between the Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribes of one State or another
and Union Territories and that the same may be followed by the
Chandigarh Administration. The letter dated 26.08.1986 stated that
Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  of  any  other  State/Union
Territory would be entitled to the benefits and facilities provided in the
services under the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Further the said
circular leaves it to the Chandigarh Administration to seek further
123clarification.  The  above  letter  of  Government  of  India  is  in  clear
violation of Constitutional scheme.
42.Pursuant to the said letter, Chandigarh Administration sought
clarification from the Department of Personnel and Training. However,
they have not received any response. The clarification was issued by
the  Home  Secretary,  Chandigarh  Administration  vide  letter  dated
07.09.1999. The said letter had given a clarification based on the
Government  of  India  circular  dated  02.02.1985  stating  that  a
Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe of any other State or Union Territory
would not be entitled to the benefits of reservation in the services in
the Chandigarh Administration and that the benefit of reservation to
persons  belonging  to  reserved  categories  in  other  States  in  the
Chandigarh  Administration  is  to  be  discontinued  with  effect  from
07.09.1999.  In  Chandigarh  Administration  case,  the  Supreme
Court  took  the  view  that  the  stand  taken  by  Chandigarh
Administration discontinuing the benefits of reservation with effect
124from  07.09.1999  was  untenable.  With  due  respect,  I  am  not  in
agreement with the view taken in   Chandigarh Administration case  .
The letter dated 26.08.1986 sent by the Ministry of Welfare/Kalyan
Mantralaya is contrary to the letter dated 22.02.1985 sent by the
Ministry of Home Affairs and also against the Constitutional scheme.
43.It  was  held  in  Subhash  Chandra  that Chandigarh
Administration  and  Pushpa  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  Marri
Chandra  Shekhar  Rao  and  Action  Committee  would  have  no
application in relation to Union Territories. Observing that both Articles
341 and 342 not only refer to the State but also to the Union Territory.
In para (64) of Subhash Chandra's case, it was held as under:-
""64. Although  Union  Territories  are  administered  by  the  Central
Government, yet it is difficult to conceive that the socio-political
aspect can be mixed up with the administrative aspect. Article 341
leads to grant of constitutional rights upon a person whose affinity
to a caste/tribe would attract the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)
Order or the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order. Once a person
comes within the purview of presidential promulgation, he would be
entitled  to  constitutional  and  other  statutory  or  administrative
benefits attached thereto. In our opinion, such socio-political rights
created in our Constitution cannot be segregated keeping in view
the administrative exigencies.”
12544.As per the scheme of the Constitution under Articles 341, 342
and 239 of the Constitution, only those Scheduled Castes/Scheduled
Tribes as notified in the Presidential Notification for the respective
Union Territory can legitimately claim the benefit of reservation in that
Union  Territory.  Even  though  the  Union  Territories  are  centrally
administered, though the administrator/Lieutenant Governor so far as
the  administrative  aspects  of  the  Union  Territories,  each  Union
Territory has its own identity.   Each of the Union Territories would be
bound  by  their  respective  Presidential  Order  of  Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  for  giving  benefit  of  reservation  to
Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  in  employment.   Only  those
persons, who come within the purview of the Presidential Notification,
would  be  entitled  to  constitutional  and  other  statutory  benefits  of
reservation  in  the  respective  Union  Territory.  If  the  benefit  of
reservation is to be extended to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes
from all over the country then it would amount to inclusion of caste,
races or tribes  to the  Presidential  Order  pertaining to  that Union
Territory.  As  discussed  earlier,  such  inclusion  or  exclusion  in  the
126Presidential Order can be done only by the Parliament in the manner
as indicated in Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution of India.
By  no  executive  order,  amendment,  alteration  or  variance  in  the
Presidential Order is permissible.  
Whether there can be PAN India reservation of SCs and STs to
services under various Union Territories of India
45.Under  Central  Civil  Services  (Classification,  Control  and
Appeal)  Rules,  1965  [CCS(CCA)  Rules,  1965],  there  are  four

49. In Serial Nos. 28 and 29 of the Schedule, we have the Union
Territories Service known as Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands,
Lakshadweep,  Daman  &  Diu  and  Dadra  &  Nagar  Haveli  Civil
Services  (DANICS)  and  Delhi,  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands,
Lakshdweep,  Daman  &  Diu  and  Dadra  &  Nagar  Haveli  Police
Services (DANIPS).  In the counter affidavit filed by the Union of
India, it is stated as under:-
“a.…….DANICS/DANIPS officers are posted in Delhi, Andaman &
Nicobar Islands, Lakshdweep, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar
Haveli.  The recruitment to all the Union Territories for these
Group B posts are common.  They are also centralised and the
appointing authority is none other than Ministry of Home Affairs,
Government of India.  The recruitment to these services is the
very  same  examination  meant  for  the  All  India  Services
(IAS/IPS) on the one hand and the Central Civil Services Group
A on the other.  Any citizen of India is eligible to apply, subject to
the  conditions  prescribed.   As  per  service  rules,  transfer
undertakings  throughout  the  Union  Territories  covered  under
DANICS/DANIPS is taken from these officers.
132b.This  is  the  reason  why  the  Union  of  India  while  inviting
applications for recruitment considers all candidates, including
reserved  candidates  on  all  India  basis.   Group  B  cadre  of
DANICS  and  DANIPS  is  the  feeder  cadre  for  IAS  and  IPS
respectively.  They retire invariably in these offices, some of
them reaching high positions in the central government.
c.As indicated above recruitment to the All India Services, CCS
Group  A as  well  as  CCS  Group  B  (Gazetted)  is  conducted
through UPSC in the Civil Services Examination, the applicants
are common when the applications are made, every aspirant
seeks recruitment to the services and it is only as per the marks
and ranking that allocations are made eventually to All India
Services,  Group  A and  Group  B.   Therefore,  when  UPSC
undertakes  the  recruitment,  it  is  naturally  a  PAN  India
recruitment and therefore it is necessary to seek applications
including from reserved candidates from all over India.”28
Central Civil Services – Group C:-
50.There are five services under Central Civil Services – Group ‘C’
under CCS (CCA) Rules.  Some of the posts noted in Group ‘C’ and
their appointing authorities are as under:-

Insofar as Group ‘C’ services of Union of India are concerned, they
are recruited by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) which is the
recruiting  agency  under  DoPT.   Members  of  these  services  get
promoted to CCS – Group ‘B’.  In the counter affidavit filed by the
Union of India, it is stated as under:-
“a.……Recruitment to posts in Group C arise out of requisition
made  by  the  concerned  ministries  all  over  India.   These
requisitions upon reaching the Staff Selection Commission are
processed  and  selection  takes  place  and  appointments  are
made.  Even from these appointees undertaking for all India
transfer liability is taken.  As these are posts under Central
Government and these employees are liable to be transferred
anywhere in the country and the recruitment being centralised
for all such posts in the country, it had been consistent policy of
134the Union of India to have PAN India eligibility.
b.The posts in CCS Group C are in the subordinate services.  The
equivalent  in  the  Union  Territory  of  Delhi  is  the  Delhi
Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS) and the recruiting
agency in the place of Staff Selection Commission is the Delhi
Subordinate Service Selection Board (DSSSB).  Members of
Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are the feeder cadre
for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS).  It is for these
reasons that the policy is consistently adopted.”29
Central Civil Services – Group D:-
51.Class  IV  employees  now  referred  to  as  Multi-Tasking  Staff
(MTS) come under this category.  Some of the posts noted in Group
‘D’ and their appointing authorities are as under:-

29 Para No. 6(iii) of the Counter Affidavit filed by the Union of India at Pg. No.5-6
13552.As  pointed  out  earlier,  there  is  centralised  recruitment
conducted by UPSC for the Central Civil Services in Group ‘A’ and
Group ‘B’.  For this centralised recruitment, applications are invited
from  candidates  across  the  country  and  Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  of  all  the  States/Union  Territories  are
entitled to apply for the reserved posts.  Recruitment to various posts
in  Group  ‘A’ and  Group  ‘B’ (Gazetted)  categories  for  services  in
States/Union Territories are presently filled only through UPSC by
centralised recruitment.  After recruitment, the Group ‘A’ and Group
‘B’ officers are posted across the country wherever there are offices
of Central Government.
53.Services mentioned at Serial No.28 that is  Delhi and Andaman
and Nicobar Islands Civil Service, Grade-II  (DANICS) are Group
‘B’ civil services. DANICS officers are posted at Delhi, Andaman and
Nicobar  Islands,  Lakshadweep,  Daman  and  Diu  and  Dadra  and
Nagar Haveli.   DANICS - Group ‘B’ civil service officers are directly
136recruited through the Central Civil Services examination conducted
by  UPSC.  Since  DANICS is  a  centralised  recruitment  conducted
through UPSC naturally applications are invited from the candidates
across  the  country  including  reserved  candidates  of  Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes.
54.Delhi,  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands  Police  Services
(DANIPS) are  recruited  directly  through  centralised  civil  services
examination conducted by UPSC. DANIPS are posted at Delhi and
other  Union  Territories  –  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands,
Lakshadweep Islands, Daman and Diu and Dadar and Nagar Haveli.
The cadre strength is controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs,
Government  of  India.  Two-thirds  of  DANIPS are  filled  by  direct
recruitment and remaining are promoted from non-gazetted police
officers of Union Territory of Delhi and other Union Territories.  Since,
DANIPS officers  are  recruited  through  a  centralised  recruitment
conducted through UPSC, applications are invited from candidates
from across the country including reserved candidates of Scheduled
137Castes and Scheduled Tribes of all the States and Union Territories.
Thus, up to Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) of Central Civil Services including
the  Group  ‘B’  (Gazetted)  services  of  Union  Territories,  there  is
Centralised Civil Services Examination conducted by UPSC with PAN
INDIA reservation.
55.Serial No.32, Group ‘B’ of CCS (CCA) Rules refers to General
Central Services.  At the risk of repetition, we may usefully refer to
Serial No.32 which reads as under:-
Serial No. 32General Central Service, Group 'B'-
(i) Post in any Ministry of Department of
Government of India, other than the post in
respect  of  which  specific  provision  has
been made by a general or special order of
the President.

Department of Government of India, other
than the posts in respect of which specific
provision has been made by a general or

Administrator
Chief Secretary
Chief Commissioner
138(v)  The  Lakshadweep  Administration-All
PostsAdministrator
As seen from the above, Serial No.32(i) and (i-a) relates to the posts
under the Government of India for which the appointing authority is
the Secretary in the Ministry or Department/Head of the Department
respectively.  Serial No.32 (ii) of Central Civil Services (CCA) Rules,
1965  relates  to  “Posts  in  Union  Territories  other  than  Delhi
Administration,  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands  and  the
Laccadive,  Minicoy  and  Amindive  Islands” .  The  appointing
authority is shown to be the ‘Administrator’. Serial No.32 (iii) to (v)
relate to  ‘All posts’ in Delhi administration, Andaman and Nicobar
Islands  and  the  Lakshadweep  administration  respectively.  Serial
No.32(ii)  posts  in  the  Union  Territories  (other  than  Delhi
Administration, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and the Laacadive,
Minicoy and Amindive Islands) Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) posts for which
recruitment  is  conducted  by  UPSC.  Since  there  is  centralised
recruitment conducted by UPSC for Group ‘B’ (Gazetted), naturally
applications  are  invited  from  the  candidates  across  the  country
139including reserved candidates of Scheduled Castes/Schedules Tribes
from all the States/Union Territories. Up to the level of Group ‘B’
(Gazetted)  of  Central  Civil  Services,  since  there  is  centralised
recruitment for which there is  PAN INDIA reservation of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes
from any State/Union Territory are entitled to apply for the reserved
posts for Group ‘B’ examinations conducted by UPSC. 
56.When it comes to services under Union Territories, there are so
many other  services like teaching, clerical  cadre, police services,
Medical Officers, Health Services, Stenographers, Typists, services
under  the  Revenue  department,  services  under  public-sector
undertakings, services under the municipalities and the corporations
in  the  Union  Territories  and  various  other  services  which  are
concerned with the administration of Union Territories. These services
under the Union Territories would fall under Group ‘B’, Group ‘C’ and
Group ‘D’ and their recruitment is within the exclusive domain of the
respective Union Territories.  Though the government servants under
140the Union Territories are governed by Central Civil Services Rules,
the services under the Union Territories are essentially different from
All  India  Services.   For  recruitment  to  services  under  respective
Union Territories, there are different modes of recruitment for the
different Union Territories.
57.This Court posed the question whether there is other category
of employees in UT administration and what is the practice followed
for  recruitment.  In  response  to  the  question,  Union  of  India,  on
instructions, filed the following response:-
SCOPE OF SC/ST RESERVATION IN UTs
1.Puducherry :Reserved  posts  confined  to  local
reserved candidates.
2.Chandigarh :Reserved  posts  filled  up  by
candidates from all India.
3.Daman & Diu :Reserved  posts  confined  to  local
reserved  candidates  for  Group  C
posts.  For Group  B  it is  opened to
candidates  from  all  India  but  local
candidates get additional 20 marks.
4.Dadra  &  Nagar
Haveli:Reserved  posts  confined  to  local
reserved  candidates  for  Group  C
posts.  For  Group  B  it  is  opened  to
candidates  from  all  India  but  local
candidates get additional 20 marks. 
5.Lakshadweep :Reserved  posts  confined  to  local
141reserved candidates.
6.A & N Islands :For Group C posts locally reserved.
7.NCT of Delhi :Reserved  posts  filled  up  by
candidates from all India.
For the above response that there is PAN India reservation of the
reserved  candidates  for  recruitment  by  Union  Territories  of
Chandigarh,  Dadra  and  Nagar  Haveli  and  NCT  of  Delhi,  no
authenticated documents were produced to substantiate the same.
When  there  are  Presidential  Orders  notifying  the  Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled Tribes for Union Territories of Chandigarh, Dadra
and  Nagar  Haveli,  calling  for  application  from  the  Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  candidates  from  all  over  India  for  the
reserved  posts  of  services  under  various  Union  Territories,  be  it
Group ‘B’ or Group ‘C’, is not in accordance with the constitutional
scheme.  
58.For Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts falling within the services of
the  Union  Territories,  recruitment  is  made  by  the  Staff  Selection
Board of respective Union Territories.  For instance, let me refer to
the Staff Selection Board of UT Administration of Daman and Diu
142whose home page reads as under:-
“In exercise of the powers conferred by the provision of Article 239
of the Constitution of India, the Administrator of Daman & Diu is
pleased  to  make  following  rules  to  regulate  the  method  of
recruitment to all Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories of posts under the
Administration of Daman & Diu.
It  aims  to  “ensure  a  uniform  and  transparent  process  and
procedures for recruitment of all Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories of
posts  under  the  Administration  of  Daman  and  Diu  through  an
autonomous  body,  without  disturbing  the  existing  recruitment
processes  and  procedures  and  for  ensuring  that  cumulative
outcome of the recruitment is to provide just and fair opportunities
to  all  the  candidates  and  for  matters  connected  therewith  or
incidental thereto30.” 
59.In response to the question posed by the court, Union of India
filed response affidavit stating that in Union Territories Daman and
Diu  and  Dadra  and  Nagar  Haveli,  for  Group  ‘B’,  it  is  opened  to
candidates  from  all  over  India.    Local  candidates  with  domicile
certificate get additional twenty per cent marks.  Response filed by
the Union of India that there is PAN India reservation for Group ‘B’
services  of  Daman  and  Diu  and  Dadra  and  Nagar  Haveli,  no
authenticated  documents/format  of  any  application  for  Group  ‘B’
posts conducted by Daman and Diu was produced before us.  Even
assuming that there is such PAN India reservation for recruitment of
30 https://daman.nic.in/staff-selection-board-daman-diu.aspx#downloads  (27.06.2018)
143Group ‘B’ conducted by the Union Territory of Daman and Diu, when
there  are  Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  as  notified  in  the
Presidential Order (Reorganisation Act, 1987 in respect of SCs/STs),
there cannot be PAN India reservation as it is not in accordance with
the constitutional scheme.
60.Pointing out that services in the Union Territories are different
from All India Services and that the mode of recruitment are also
different, in para (29) of  Subhash Chandra and another v. Delhi
Subordinate Service Selection Board and others (2009) 15 SCC
458, it was held as under:-
“29. Concededly, in respect of education or service, there exists a
distinction  between  State  Services  and  State-run  institutions
including  the  Union  Territory  Services  and  Union  Territory-run
institutions on the one hand, and the Central Civil Services and the
institutions run by the Central Government on the other. Whereas in
the case of the former, the reservation whether for admission or
appointment in an institution and employment or appointment in the
services or posts in a State or Union Territory must confine to the
members  of  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  as
notified  in  the  Presidential  Orders  but  in  respect  of  All  India
Services, Central Civil Services or admission to an institution run
and  founded  by  the  Central  Government,  the  members  of  the
Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  and  other  reserved
category candidates irrespective of their State for which they have
been notified are entitled to the benefits thereof. It is not denied or
144disputed that services in the Union Territory is essentially different
from  All  India  Services.  It  is  also  beyond  any  controversy  that
machinery for recruitment is also different. Indisputably again, not
only the conditions of recruitment but also conditions of service
differ.”
I  am  in  full  agreement  with  the  view  taken  by  Justice  Sinha  in
Subhash Chandra case .
61.Rule 3 of Delhi Administration Subordinate Services (DASS)
Rules, 1967 deals with constitution of services and its classification in
Delhi Administration.  As per Rule 3(3) of DASS Rules, the post in
Grade-I, Class-II Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) and those in Grades II, III and
IV shall be Central Civil Services Posts.  But as noted earlier, as per
Serial No.32 – General Central Service, Group ‘B’, insofar as
Delhi  Administration  –  All  Posts  (Serial  No.  32  (iii)),  the
Appointing  Authority  is  the  Chief  Secretary .   The  subordinate
services in the National Capital Territory of Delhi though “Central Civil
Services”,  they  are  neither  All  India  Services  nor  services  under
Union of India so as to attract Pan India Reservation.
14562.Even in the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India, by
referring to Group ‘C’ services, it is stated that CCS – Group ‘C’ are in
the subordinate services and there are equivalent services in the
Union Territory of Delhi.  For recruitment of other employees in the
Union Territory of Delhi, there is Delhi Administrative Subordinate
Services (DASS) and the recruiting agency is Delhi Subordinate Staff
Selection  Board  (DSSSB).   Members  of  Delhi  Administrative
Subordinate Services are stated to be the feeder cadre for Central
Civil Services – Group ‘B’ (DANICS).31  Merely because members of
Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are the feeder category for
DANICS,  PAN  India  reservation  cannot  be  extended  to  Delhi
Subordinate Services or to services under various Union Territories.
Likewise, merely because, DANICS and DANIPS (Serial Nos. 28 and
29 of Group ‘B’ Services) are the feeder category for IAS and IPS, it
cannot  be  said  that  the  Pan  India  Reservation  is  applicable  to
services under National Capital Territory of Delhi.
31 Para No. 6(iii) of the Counter Affidavit filed by the Union of India at Pg. No.6
14663.So  far  as  Group  ‘B’ and  Group  ‘C’ posts  falling  under  the
services  of  the  Union  Territories,  recruitment  is  done  by  the
respective  Staff  Selection  Board  of  respective  Union  Territories.
Serial No.4 (iii) – ‘ Posts in Union Territories’ of Group ‘C’ in CCS
(CCA) Rules is shown and the appointing authority is stated as Head
of the Office of such other authority as may be specified by the
Administrator. Merely because the posts in the Union Territories and
the appointing authority are shown in Group ‘C’ in CCS (CCA) Rules,
that does not mean that those Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ posts are
available for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of all the
States/Union Territories. For recruitment of Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’
posts of services under the respective Union Territories, since the
examination  is  conducted  by  the  respective  Union  Territories  like
Delhi Subordinate Staff Selection Board and other Union Territories
Staff Selection Boards of respective Union Territories, reservation of
posts of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes must be confined only
to  those  Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  as  notified  in  the
Presidential Order of the respective Union Territories. For recruitment
147of Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts under various Union Territories
including  Union  Territory  of  Delhi,  there  cannot  be  PAN  INDIA
reservation  of  Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes,  lest,  it  would
defeat the very object of the Presidential Orders issued specifying the
Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes for respective Union Territories.
64.As  pointed  out  earlier,  services  under  the  Union  Territories
though  they  are  Central  Government  services,  they  are  services
under the respective Union Territories and not under the direct control
of Union of India/different Ministries.  Procedure for recruitment to the
various posts for the services of Union Territories are different as
followed by respective Union Territories.  The persons appointed for
the services of Union Territories might be governed by CCS (CCA)
Rules; but they are employees of respective Union Territories.  The
appointing authorities are the authorities under the administration of
Union  Territories  and  not  under  the  Ministries  of  Union  of  India.
Central Civil Services are the services directly under Union of India.
Contrarily,  various  services  under  the  Union  Territories  are  the
148services under the respective Union Territories.  Such services under
Union Territories cannot be said to be Central Civil Services that is
services under Union of India to extend the benefit of PAN India
reservation for recruitment to the services under respective Union
Territories including Union Territory of Delhi.
65.In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 341,
the  President  issued  the  Constitution  (Scheduled  Castes)  Union
Territories Order, 1951 in the Presidential Order specifying Scheduled
Castes in relation to Delhi and the thirty-six castes/groups notified are
as under:-

In relation to Delhi, there are thirty-six castes notified as Scheduled
Castes in the Presidential Order.  The members of the Scheduled
Castes in Delhi are drawn from castes, races and by virtue of the
Presidential Order pertaining to Delhi, they attain the status of the
Scheduled Caste. In view of the Presidential Order issued for the
Scheduled Castes to Delhi, only those Scheduled Castes can claim
the benefit of reservation in the employment under the Union Territory
of Delhi who are notified in the Presidential Order.  Neither the Delhi
Government nor the court can add any caste or group to the list of
Scheduled  Castes  notified  in  the  Presidential  Order.  Once  a
Presidential  Order  has  been  issued  under  Article  341(1)  of  the
150Constitution, any addition or deletion to the Presidential Order can
only be made by the Parliament by law as provided under Article
341(2) and in no other manner.  Merely because, Delhi Subordinate
Services is a feeder category for DANICS, there cannot be Pan India
Reservation  of the SCs and STs for the services under Group ‘C’
and  ‘D’ categories,  for  which  recruitment  are  made  by  the  Delhi
Subordinate Staff Selection Board (DSSSB).
66.Likewise,  the  Presidential  Order  has  notified  the  following
Scheduled Castes for the Union Territory of Chandigarh, Daman and

Chambhar, Mochi5.Mang
MaharConstitution (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) Scheduled Tribes Order,

Bo,  Yere,  Kede,  Bea
Balawa,  Bojigiyab,

Jarawas 5.The Nicoberese
Onges 6.The Shompens
When  Andaman  &  Nicobar  Islands  is  recruiting  persons  to  the
services of Group ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ under its administration, it has to
necessarily follow the policy of recruiting members from amongst the
Scheduled  Tribes  who  are  notified  as  Scheduled  Tribes  in  the
Presidential Notification for Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  It will not
be appropriate to extend the benefit of reservation to the SCs and
STs  from  other  States/Union  Territories,  lest  it  would  deprive  the
notified Scheduled Tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  
68.It may be that the candidates recruited by the respective Union
Territories  for  Group  ‘B’ and  Group  ‘C’ may  become  the  feeder
153categories for further promotion in Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ of All India
Services respectively in the Central Civil Services.  The fact that the
candidates  who  are  recruited  by  the  respective  Union  Territories
become the feeder categories for further promotion in the Central
Civil Services is not a ground for extending the benefit of all India
reservation  to  the  Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  for  the
reserved posts in the respective Union Territories.  Be it noted that the
candidates recruited by the various State Governments under Group
‘A’ of respective State services become the feeder category for IAS
and IPS.   The persons recruited for Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ by the
respective Union Territories stand on the same footing as that of the
candidates  so  recruited  by  the  various  States  where  only  the
Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  of  the  respective  States  can
apply.
69.A  letter  dated  10.05.2013  by  Special  Secretary  (Services)
addressed to all the Secretaries/Heads of Departments of NCT of
Delhi has been filed by the Union of India.  The letter relates to the
subject “Reservation policy to be followed with regard to SCs/STs in
154civil posts under GNCTD”.  The said letter refers to the judgment in
Pushpa’s case  and states that the Ministry of Law and Justice has
opined that the law declared by the Supreme Court in  Pushpa’s
case applies to the NCT of Delhi and that Pushpa’s case  cannot be
ignored.  Relevant portion of the said letter reads as under:-

……
The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi follows the
guidelines and instructions issued by the Government of India from time to
time in matters regarding reservation to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

70.PAN India reservation probably is followed by NCT of Delhi in
its recruitment based on the above letter dated 10.05.2013.  Since I
have taken the view that the decision in  Pushpa’s case  is not a
correct decision extending PAN India reservation for the reserved
posts recruited by NCT of Delhi or any other Union Territories is
against the Presidential Orders issued under Articles 341 and 342 of
the Constitution of India and against the constitutional scheme.
71.As discussed earlier in para  (8), in case of Union Territories,
though administrative control to certain extent is exercised by the
156Union of India, Union Territories do not lose their identity as an entity.
The existing practice of PAN INDIA reservation followed in Delhi and
Chandigarh is against the constitutional scheme and also against the
executive instructions dated 06.08.1984 and 22.02.1985 issued by
the Ministry of Home Affairs.
72.As pointed our earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs in its circular
dated 06.08.1984 addressed to all the State Governments and Union
Territories administration stated that SCs and STs on migration from
the State of his origin to other State will not loose his status as
SCs/STs;  but  will  be  entitled  to  the  concession/benefits  to  the
SCs/STs from the State of his origin and not from the State where he
has migrated.  The same thing was reiterated in the letter dated
22.02.1985 of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.  If
PAN India reservation is to be extended to the Union Territories like
Delhi,  Chandigarh,  Puducherry,  Andaman  &  Nicobar  Islands  or
Daman & Diu for Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ services for which recruitment are
made  by  the  respective  Union  Territories,  the  very  object  of  the
157Constitutional Scheme of upliftment of the SCs/STs of these Union
Territories will be defeated.  All India reservation to the services under
the Union Territories including the Union Territory of Delhi will be
against the mandate of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution and
against the Constitutional Scheme.
73.Marri  Chandra  Shekhar  Rao  and  Action  Committee  are
applicable to the States and they are applicable with equal force to
the Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi. There cannot
be  any  distinction  between  the  States  and  the  Union  Territories.
Likewise, there can be no distinction between Union Territory of Delhi
and other Union Territories.  When Presidential Orders of Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  are  notified  for  various  Union  Territories
including Union Territory of Delhi extending PAN India reservation to
the  employment  falling  under  the  services  of  Union  Territories
including Union Territory of Delhi, will be against the Constitutional
scheme and the law laid down in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and
Action Committee.
15874.Article  16(4)  of  the  Constitution  has  to  yield  to  the
constitutional  mandate  of  Articles  341  and  342  of  the
Constitution.  The Presidential Order issued under Article 341 in
regard to Scheduled Castes and Article 342 in regard to Scheduled
Tribes  cannot  be  varied  by  anyone  or  by  the  Court.   Only  the
Parliament  by  law  include  or  exclude  from  the  list  of  Scheduled
Castes or Scheduled Tribes specified in the notification issued under
Article 341 (1) and Article 342(1) respectively any caste, race or tribe
or parts or group within any caste, race or tribe.  The Scheduled
Castes or Scheduled Tribes thus specified in relation to one State or
Union Territory does not carry the status in another State or Union
Territory.   When  the  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled  Tribes  are
specified for each State in relation to one State or Union Territory,
neither  the  State  legislature,  the  administration  of  the  Union
Territories and nor the courts can include or exclude other Scheduled
Castes or Scheduled Tribes so notified in the Presidential Order.
Providing all India reservation to the services of Union Territories
159including Union Territory of Delhi, would be against the mandate of
Articles 341 and 342 and the Presidential Orders issued thereon. If
that is permitted, it would amount to addition or alteration of the
Presidential  Order  which  is  impermissible  and  violative  of  the
Constitutional Scheme.
75.It is the responsibility of each State/Union Territory to provide
for such reservation/affirmative action by positive discretion to bring
backward classes/Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the
respective States/areas to provide socio-economic empowerment. If
the reservation to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are to
be extended to all categories of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes all over India or to the migrants then there is every possibility
of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of other developed
States  and  Union  Territories  squandering  reservations  to  the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are disadvantaged in
the respective States/Union Territories including Union Territory of
Delhi.  If this is permitted, it would defeat the very object of providing
160reservation to the disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in a particular State or Union territory. The enabling provision
of Article 16(4) of the Constitution has to yield to the constitutional
scheme of Article 341 and Article 342 of the Constitution.
76.Conclusion:-
Insofar as the States, I agree with the majority view
that  a  person  who  is  recognised  as  a  member  of
Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  in  his  original
State, will be entitled to all the benefits of reservation
under the Constitution in that State only and not in
other States/Union Territories and not entitled to the
benefits  of  reservation  in  the  migrated  State/Union
Territory.
Marri  Chandra  Shekhar  Rao  and  Action
Committee are applicable to the States and they are
applicable with equal force to the Union Territories
including Union Territory of Delhi. There cannot be
161any  distinction  between  the  States  and  the  Union
Territories.  Likewise,  there  can  be  no  distinction
between  Union  Territory  of  Delhi  and  other  Union
Territories.  When Presidential Orders of Scheduled
Castes/Scheduled  Tribes  are  notified  for  various
Union  Territories  including  Union  Territory  of  Delhi
extending PAN India reservation to the employment
falling under the services of Union Territories including
Union  Territory  of  Delhi,  will  be  against  the
Constitutional scheme and the law laid down in Marri
Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee. 
Since there is centralised recruitment upto Group ‘B’
(Gazetted)  services  conducted  by  UPSC  for  the
Central  Civil  Services  posts  in  the  States/Union
Territories of India, there has to be necessarily PAN
India  reservation  for  Scheduled  Castes/Scheduled
Tribes  for  those  recruitment  conducted  by  UPSC.
Sofaras Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts falling under
162services of Union Territories including Union Territory of
Delhi  for  which  recruitment  is  conducted  by  the
respective Union Territories, benefit of reservation in
employment (Article 16(4)) is to be extended only to
those Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes specified in
the  Presidential  Order  of  the  respective  Union
Territories.  Insofar as the posts recruited by the Staff
Selection  Board  of  the  respective  Union  Territories
including the Union Territory of Delhi, there cannot be
PAN  India reservation for Group ‘B’,  Group ‘C’ and
Group ‘D’ posts falling under the services of various
Union Territories and such PAN India reservation would
be  against  the  constitutional  scheme  and  Marri
Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee.

1.The moot question which arises before us is whether the
application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act,   1996(hereinafter   being   referred   to   as   “Act   1996”)   is
maintainable in view of Section 3G(5) of the National Highways
Act, 1956 (hereinafter being referred to as “Act 1956”) which
provides   for   appointment   of   an   Arbitrator   by   the   Central
Government.
12.The   relevant   seminal   facts   are   that   the   subject   land
comprised in “Sayedabad Tea Estate” situated at Mouza Purba
Madati, J.L. No. 108, Police Station Phansidewa, Dist. Darjeeling
measuring 5.08 acres was acquired by the appellant (National
Highways   Authority   of   India)   in   exercise   of   its   powers   under
Section   3(D)   of   the   Act   1956   vide   notification   dated   22nd
November,   2005   under   L.A.P.   Case   No.   4/2004­05   for   the
purpose of construction of the highways.
3.The   Act,   1956   is   a   comprehensive   code   in   itself   and   a
special legislation enacted by the Parliament for acquisition and
for determining compensation and its disbursement where there
are   several   claimants   over   the   amount   deposited   towards
compensation   determined   by   the   competent   authority   in
accordance with the mechanism provided under Section 3G of
the Act, 1956.   If the amount so determined by the competent
authority under sub­section(1) or sub­section (2) of Section 3G is
not acceptable to either of the parties, the amount shall, on an
application   by   either   of   the   parties,   be   determined   by   the
Arbitrator   to   be   appointed   by  the   Central   Government   under
2Section   3G(5)   of   the   Act.     While   determining   the   amount   of
compensation under sub­section(1) or sub­section(5), it is the
duty of the Arbitrator to take into  consideration  the relevant
pointers envisaged under sub­section(7) of Section 3G of the Act,
1956.   Where the amount determined by the Arbitrator is in
excess of the amount determined by the competent authority
under Section 3G of the Act, 1956, the Arbitrator may, at its
discretion, award interest at nine per cent per annum on the
excess amount under sub­section (5) of Section 3H from the date
of taking possession under Section 3D till the date of actual
deposit.
4.The extract of the sections of the Act 1956 relevant for the
purpose are as under:­
“3G.   Determination   of   amount   payable   as
compensation.—
(1) ………
(2)  ………
(3)  ………
(4)  ………
(5) If the amount determined by the competent authority
under   sub­section   (1)   or   sub­section   (2)   is   not
acceptable to either of the parties, the amount shall,
on   an   application   by   either   of   the   parties,   be
3determined by the arbitrator to be appointed by the
Central Government.
(6) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the provisions of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996)
shall apply to every arbitration under this Act. 
(7)  The   competent   authority   or   the   arbitrator   while

section   (5),   as   the   case   may   be,   shall   take   into
consideration— 
(a)the market value of the land on the date
of publication of the notification under
section 3A; 
(b)the   damage,   if   any,   sustained   by   the
person interested at the time of taking
possession of the land, by reason of the
severing of such land from other land; 
(c)the   damage,   if   any,   sustained   by   the
person interested at the time of taking
possession of the land, by reason of the
acquisition   injuriously   affecting   his
other   immovable   property   in   any
manner, or his earnings; 
(d)if, in consequences of the acquisition of
the   land,   the   person   interested   is

5.In   the   instant   case,   the   respondent­applicant   being
dissatisfied with the award of compensation determined by the
competent authority under sub­section(1) of Section 3G of the
Act, 1956 filed application for appointment of an Arbitrator in
terms   of   Section   3G(5)   to   the   Central   Government   on   8th
December, 2006.  As alleged, since the Central Government has
not responded to his request for appointment of an Arbitrator in
terms of letter dated 8th  December, 2006 within a period of 30
days from receipt of the request, application was filed on 7th
March, 2007 to the Chief Justice/his designate for appointment
of   an   Arbitrator   invoking   Section   11(6)   of   the   Act,   1996.     It
reveals   that   the   Arbitrator   was   appointed   by   the   Central
Government sometime in April 2007.
6.The High Court of Calcutta taking note of the fact that the
Arbitrator has been appointed by the Central Government under
Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956 after the respondent­applicant had
5moved an application to the Chief Justice/his Designate invoking
its power under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 held that right of
appointment of the Arbitrator by the Central Government stands
forfeited as it failed to appoint the Arbitrator until filing of the
application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 before the High
Court   of   Calcutta   and   appointment   of   Arbitrator   during   the
pendency   of   proceedings,   cannot   be   said   to   be   a   valid
appointment and hence referred the matter to be placed before
the Chief Justice for naming an Arbitrator vide its Order dated 6th
July, 2007.
7.Immediately after passing of the order dated 6th July, 2007,
the appellant moved an application for review and it was brought
to the notice of the High Court that the Act, 1956 being a special
enactment   laying   down   a   procedure   for   appointment   of   an
Arbitrator where the power is being exclusively vested with the
Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956, the
application made under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is not
maintainable but this was not considered to be a valid reason for
invoking   review   jurisdiction   by   the   High   Court   as   envisaged
under Order 47 Rule 1 read with Section 114 of Code of Civil
6Procedure and the review application was dismissed vide Order
dated August 27, 2007.
8.It may be relevant to note that the sole Arbitrator (Justice
P.N. Sinha) who was appointed by the High Court of Calcutta
pursuant to Order dated 6th July, 2007 under Section 11 of the
Act, 1996 before initiation of the proceedings, sent the letter of
his recusal dated 25th January, 2008 (Annexure P­12).
9.It is informed to this Court that the Arbitrator who was
appointed by the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the
Act,   1956  in   April,   2007  could   not  have   proceeded  after  the
intervention   was   made   by   the   High   Court   of   Calcutta   in
appointing the sole Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act,
1996.  That for all practical purposes, the dispute raised by the
respondent­applicant   aggrieved   by   the   compensation   awarded
under sub­sections(1) or (2) of Section 3G of the Act, 1956 has so
far   not   been   adjudicated   because   of   the   competence   of   the
authority in appointing the Arbitrator remain pending decision as
to whether it would be under the Act, 1956 or Act, 1996 as
7invoked by the High Court of Calcutta under the order impugned
before us.
10.Mr. Vikas Goel, learned counsel for the appellant submits
that the Act 1956 being a special enactment is a code in itself
provide not only the procedure of acquisition but also the mode of
determining compensation by the competent authority and any
person, if aggrieved by the compensation determined under sub­
sections(1) or (2) of Section 3G of Act 1956 can certainly move an
application for appointment of an Arbitrator to which a Central
Government is under obligation to appoint under Section 3G(5) of
the Act 1956.   But before the matter could be proceeded, the
respondent­applicant   approached   the   High   Court   by   filing   an
application under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 which was not
maintainable and this being the settled principles of law that the
special law prevail over the general law, the provisions of Act
1996 could not have been invoked at least for the appointment of
an Arbitrator in abrogating the power of the Central Government
in appointing the Arbitrator as contemplated under Section 3G(5)
of Act 1956 and this being an apparent error in law committed by
the High Court needs to be interfered by this Court.  
811.In   support   of   his   submission,   learned   counsel   for   the
appellant   has   placed   reliance   on   the   recent   judgment  of   two
Judges’   Bench   of   this   Court   in   General   Manager   (Project),
National   Highways   and   Infrastructure   Development
Corporation Ltd.  Vs. Prakash Chand Pradhan & Ors . passed
in Civil Appeal No. 5250 of 2018 decided on 16th May, 2018 and
taking assistance thereof submits that the order passed by the
High Court of Calcutta in the appointment of an Arbitrator under
Section 11(6) of Act 1996 is not legally sustainable and both the
Orders passed by the High Court, i.e. 6th  July, 2007 and 27th
August, 2007 deserves to be quashed and set aside.
12.Per contra, Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel for the
respondents,   while   supporting   the   order   passed   by   the   High
Court of Calcutta impugned in the instant proceedings submits
that sub­section(6) of Section 3G clearly postulates that subject
to the provisions of the Act 1956, the provisions of Act 1996 shall
apply to every arbitration under the Act, 1956.  If the authority to
whom   application   was   filed   for   appointment   of   an   Arbitrator
9under   Section   3G(5)   of   Act,   1956   has   failed   to   discharge   its
obligations   within   30   days   of   presentation   of   the   application
which indisputedly was December, 2006 or until filing of the
application   for   appointment   of   an   Arbitrator   to   the   Chief
Justice/his Designate under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 i.e. 7th
March, 2007, the respondent was justified in taking recourse to
sub­section(6) of Section 3G of Act, 1956 for appointment of an
Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of Act, 1996. 
13.Learned counsel further submits that the appellant under
the Act, 1956 has forfeited its right to appoint an Arbitrator after
presentation of the application under the Act, 1996 before the
High Court of Calcutta and in the given circumstances, there was
no   legal   impediment   before   the   High   Court   of   Calcutta   in
appointment of an Arbitrator invoking Section 11(6) of Act 1996
and   in   support   of   his   submission   placed   reliance   on   the
judgment of this Court in  Deep Trading Company  Vs. Indian
Oil Corporation and Others   1.
1 2013(4) SCC 35
1014.We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with
their assistance perused the material available on record.
15.At the very outset, we may notice that the two Judge Bench
of   this   Court   in   the   recent   judgment   in   General   Manager
(Project),   National   Highways   and   Infrastructure
Development Corporation Ltd. case (supra), while dealing with
the scope of sub­sections (5) and (6) of Section 3G of the Act
1956 with reference to Section 11 of the Act, 1996 has held that
the   Act   1956   being   a   special   enactment   and   Section   3G   in
particular provides an inbuilt mechanism for appointment of an
Arbitrator by the Central Government.  Hence  Section 11 of the
Act, 1996 has no application and the power is exclusively vested
with the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the Act,
1956   for   appointment   of   an   Arbitrator   and   if   the   Central
Government does not appoint an Arbitrator within a reasonable
time, it is open for the party to avail the remedy either by filing a
writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or a
suit for the purpose but the remedy of Section 11 of Act 1996 is
not available for appointment of an Arbitrator.
1116.We are in full agreement with the legal position stated by a
two Judge Bench of this Court in   General Manager (Project),
National   Highways   and   Infrastructure   Development
Corporation Ltd. case (supra) but like to add further that the
Act, 1956 has been enacted under Entry 23 of the Union List of
the   Seventh   Schedule   of   the   Constitution   with   the   exclusive
power to legislate with respect to highways, which are declared to
be national highways by or under law by the Parliament.  It is a
comprehensive code and a special enactment which provides an
inbuilt   mechanism   not   only   in   initiating   acquisition   until
culmination of the proceedings in determining the compensation
and its adjudication by the Arbitrator to be appointed by the
Central Government and if still remain dissatisfied, by the Court
of law.
17.   In compliance of the mandate of Sections 3A to 3F of the
Act, 1956, after the land is acquired, there shall be paid an
amount of compensation which shall be determined by an order
of   the   competent   authority   under   sub­sections   (1)   or   (2)   of
12Section 3G of the Act, 1956 and any person who is aggrieved by
the amount so determined by the competent authority or what
being determined is not acceptable to either of the parties, on an
application   being   filed   by   either   of   the   parties,   has   to   be
determined   by   the   Arbitrator   to   be   appointed   by   the   Central
Government in terms of sub­section (5) of Section 3G of the Act,
1956. 
18.After analysing the scheme, it can be assumed that the
legislature intended the Act, 1956 to act as a complete code in
itself for the purpose of acquisition until culmination including
disbursement and for settlement of disputes and this conclusion
is further strengthened in view of Section 3J of the Act which
eliminates the application of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, to
an acquisition under the Act, 1956.
19.It is settled principles of law that when the special law sets
out a self­contained code, the application of general law would
impliedly be excluded.   In the instant case, the scheme of Act,
1956   being   a   special   law   enacted   for   the   purpose   and   for
appointment of an arbitrator by the Central Government under
13Section 3G(5) of Act, 1956 and sub­section (6) of Section 3G itself
clarifies   that   subject   to   the   provisions   of   the   Act   1956,   the
provisions of Act 1996 shall apply to every arbitration obviously
to the extent where the Act 1956 is silent, the Arbitrator may
take recourse in adjudicating the dispute invoking the provisions
of   Act,   1996   for   the   limited   purpose.     But   so   far   as   the
appointment   of   an   Arbitrator   is   concerned,   the   power   being
exclusively   vested   with   the   Central   Government   as   envisaged
under sub­section (5) of Section 3G of Act 1956, Section 11 of the
Act 1996 has no application.
20.The plea of the respondents that they have rightly taken
recourse in the facts and circumstances of Section 11 of the Act,
1996 cannot be accepted for the reason that Section 3G(6) of the
Act, 1956 clearly stipulates that the provisions of the Act, 1996
will apply subject to the provisions of the Act, 1956.  The usage of
the expression “subject to” clearly indicates that the legislature
intended to give overriding effect to the provisions of the Act,
1956 where it relates to the disputes pertaining to determination
of the amount of compensation under the Act.   The irresistible
conclusion   is   that   the   legislature   in   its   wisdom   intended   to
14abrogate the power for appointment of an Arbitrator under the
provisions of the Act, 1996.
21.In our considered view, the High Court of Calcutta was not
holding its competence to appoint an Arbitrator invoking Section
11 of Act, 1996.
22.  This very question earlier arose before this Court whether
the   application   under   Section   11(6)   of   the   Act   1996   is
maintainable in view of statutory provisions of Electricity Act,
2003 adjudicating the dispute between  the licencees and  the
generating companies of the special enactment and Section 86(1)
of the Electricity Act, 2003 in particular, this Court in  Gujarat
Urja Vikash Nigam Ltd.  Vs. Essar Power Limited   2in para 28
observed as under:­
28. Section 86(1)(f)  is a special provision and hence will
override   the   general   provision   in   Section   11   of   the
Arbitration and  Conciliation Act, 1996 for arbitration of
disputes   between   the   licensee   and   generating
companies.   It   is   well   settled   that   the   special   law
overrides   the   general   law.   Hence,   in   our
opinion, Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 has no application to the question who can
adjudicate/arbitrate   disputes   between   licensees   and
2 2008(4) SCC 755
15generating companies, and only Section 86(1)(f)  shall
apply in such a situation.
23.We are also of the considered opinion that in view of the
power being vested exclusively with the Central Government to
appoint an Arbitrator under Section 3G(5) of the Act 1956, being
a special enactment, the application filed under Section 11(6) of
the   Act   1996   for   appointment   of   an   Arbitrator   was   not
maintainable   and   provisions   of   the   Act,   1996   could   not   be
invoked for the purpose.
24.The submission of learned counsel for the respondents that
as the appellant failed to make an appointment of the Arbitrator
pursuant to a letter dated 8th December, 2006 in terms of Section
3G(5) of the Act, 1956 within a period of 30 days, the High Court
of   Calcutta   alone   was   holding   its   competence   to   appoint   an
Arbitrator   and   application   was   submitted   by   the   respondent­
applicant on 7th  March, 2007 the right of appointment of an
Arbitrator by the Central Government stands forfeited and has
relied on the Judgment of this Court in  Deep Trading Company
case(supra) is of without substance for the reason that there is
no statutory limitation provided under sub­section (5) of Section
163G   of   Act   1956   for   the   Central   Government   to   appoint   an
Arbitrator but that may not give an unguided discretion to the
authority and in the absence of any statutory limitation, it must
be within the reasonable time and if the Central Government fails
in discharge of its statutory duty in appointing an Arbitrator on a
request being made by either of the party aggrieved, it will be
open to the party to invoke either the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or the Civil
Court for the purpose.  But as long as the power is exclusively
vested   with   the   Central   Government   for   appointment   of   an
Arbitrator under Section 3G(5) of the Act 1956, the provision of
Section 11 of Act 1996 has no application.   The judgment in
Deep Trading Company case (supra) on which learned counsel
has placed reliance is of no assistance for the reason firstly that
controversy there was not in reference to the appointment of an
Arbitrator under the special enactment as in the instant case
under Act 1956 and secondly, if one party fails to exercise its
power of appointment in terms of Clause 29 of the agreement in
vogue, the provisions of Act 1996 would apply and the question
for   consideration   was   whether   the   rights   of   the   party   stand
forfeited to appoint an Arbitrator after the party has invoked
17Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 which, as already observed by us, is
not the question for consideration in the instant case.
25.It is indeed true that the Arbitrator who was appointed by
the Central Government subsequent to the filing of an application
under   Section   11   of   the   Act   1996   in   April,   2007   could   not
proceed after the Arbitrator was appointed pursuant to the Order
impugned in the instant proceedings, who too has later recused
and almost 12 years have rolled by now, we deem it appropriate
to observe that there is no need to file any application by the
respondent­applicant and the Central Government shall consider
and appoint an Arbitrator in terms of Section 3G(5) of the Act
1956 within a period of 30 days with prior intimation to the
respondents. As the litigation has consumed a sufficient long
time,   we   consider   it   appropriate   to   further   observe   that   the
Arbitrator   so   appointed   by   the   Central   Government   may
adjudicate and decide the dispute within a reasonable time but in
no case later than six months after the respondent­applicant
record its presence in the proceedings.
1826.The   appeals   accordingly   succeed   and   are   allowed.     The
orders passed by the High Court dated 6th  July, 2007 and 27th
August,   2007   are   hereby   set   aside.     The   Arbitrator   may   be
appointed by the appellants in terms indicated above.  No costs.
27.Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

Dipak Misra, CJI.
In this Writ Petition preferred under Article 32 of the
Constitution of India, the petitioner No. 1­Indian Centre for
Advancement of Research and Education, Haldia (ICARE), a
society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1961
through its Secretary, and the petitioner No. 2­ICARE Institute
of Medical Sciences and Research and Dr. Bidhan Chandra2
Roy   Hospital,   Haldia   situated   in   West   Bengal   through   its
Principal   have   prayed   for   issue   of   a   writ   of   certiorari   for
quashment   of   the   order   dated   31.05.2017   passed   by   the
competent authority of the Government of India, Ministry of
Health   and   Family   Welfare   and   further   to   issue   writ   of
mandamus or directing the respondents to grant recognition
under Section 11(2) of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956
(for brevity, ‘the Act’) approval to the petitioner No. 2 College
and recognition to the MBBS degree to be awarded by the
West Bengal University of Health Sciences, Kolkata in respect
of the students who have completed their courses at petitioner
No. 2 College.
2.The   facts   which   are   essential   for   the   purpose   of
adjudication of the controversy are that the petitioner No. 2
College was established in 2011 and it has been imparting
education in MBBS courses since the academic year 2011­
2012   and   has   been   granted   renewal   permission   for   all
subsequent years up to 2016­2017. For the purpose of grant
of renewal of permission under Section 10­A of the Act, a3
surprise   assessment   was   carried   out   by   the   assessors   on
05.11.2015   and   06.11.2015.   The   assessment   report   dated
06.11.2015   showed   certain   deficiencies   and   thereafter   the
same   being   not   removed   by   the   institution,   the   Executive
Committee of the Medical Council of India (MCI) recommended
to the Central Government not to renew permission for the
admission   of   6th  batch   (100   seats)   of   the   MBBS   for   the
academic   year   2016­2017.     The   petitioners   came   to   know
about the recommendation and the deficiencies and through
communication   dated   02.01.2016   informed   the   respondent
No.   1   that   the   deficiencies   pointed   out   in   the   assessment
report   dated   06.11.2015   had   been   duly   rectified   and
accordingly submitted for compliance report. A request was
made for issuance of Letter of Permission for admission of 6th
batch of MBBS course for the academic year 2016­2017 on the
basis of the compliance report.
3.After receipt of the compliance report from the petitioner
No. 2, the second respondent carried out a surprise inspection
for clarification of the compliance on 19.02.2016. On the date4
of   inspection,   the   assessors   found   certain   deficiencies   and
eventually on 14.05.2016 recommended to the respondent No.
1 not to renew the permission for admission of the 6th batch
(100 seats) in MBBS course for the academic year 2016­2017. 
4.The   decision   of   the   Executive   Committee   of   the   MCI
taken on meeting held on 13.05.2016 is note worthy. It is as
follows:
“The   Executive   Committee   of   the   Council
considered   the   compliance   verification
assessment,   report   (19th  February   2016)
alongwith previous assessment report (5th  & 6th
November,   2015)   as   well   as   letter   dated
19/02/2016 and 14.03.2016 received from the
Principal of the college and noted the following:­
1. Deficiency of faculty is 67% as detailed in the
report
2. Shortage of Residents is 85% as detailed in the
report
3.   Bed   occupancy   was   only   08%   on   day   of
assessment which is grossly inadequate. Many
wards were closed.
4.   OPD   attendance   was   only   250   on   day   of
assessment which is grossly inadequate.
5. Casualty attendance was only 09 on day of
assessment.   No   Casualty   Medical   Officer   was
present on day of assessment5
6. There was NIL Major & NIL Minor operation on
day of assessment
7.   There   was   NIL   Normal   Delivery   &   NIL
Caesarean Section on day of assessment
8.   Radiological   &   Laboratory   investigation
workload   is   inadequate.   Separate   register   for
Laboratory investigation is not available.
9. Histopathology & Cytopathology workload is
NIL on day of assessment.
10. ICUs: ICCU beds are not available. MICU &
ICCU are common.
11.   Otho.   Deficiencies   as   pointed   out   in   the
assessment report.
In view of the above, the Executive Committee of
the Council decided to recommend to the Central
Govt. not to renew the permission for admission
of 6 inbatch of 100 MBBS students at ICARE
Institute of Medical Sciences & Research, Haldia,
West   Bengal   under   West   Bengal   University   of
Health Sciences, Kolkata u/s 10A of the IMC Act,
1956 for the academic year 2016­2017.”
5.After   receipt   of   the   recommendation   of   the   Executive
Committee   of   the   MCI,   the   first   respondent   vide
communication   dated   10.06.2016   directed   the   petitioner
institution not to admit any students in 6th batch (100 seats)
in   MBBS   course   for   the   academic   year   2016­2017.   It   is
necessary   to   state   here   that   by   that   time   the   Oversight6
Committee   had   come   into   existence   by   virtue   of   the
Constitution Bench judgment in  Modern Dental College and
Research Center and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh
and others1.  The Oversight Committee informed the MCI that
it had decided in its meeting held on 13.06.2016 to permit all
colleges   which   had   not   been   afforded   an   opportunity   of
hearing   to   present   their   compliance   deficiencies
communicated by MCI in the inspection/verification reports
for   2016­2017   be   given   an   opportunity   to   furnish   their
compliance reports to respondent No. 1. The petitioner College
submitted its fresh application for renewal permission for 6th
batch   (100   seat)   for   the   academic   year   2016­2017   on
20.06.2016 along with the compliance report.  The petitioners
also submitted   a  letter  dated  30.07.2016  to   the   Oversight
Committee clarifying the factual position in respect of alleged
deficiencies pointed out by the assessors and thereafter, the
first respondent vide communication dated 20.08.2016 on the
basis   of   the   report   of   the   Oversight   Committee   granted
permission for the 6th  batch (100 seats) in MBBS course for
1 (2016) 7 SCC 3537
the academic year 2016­2017 under Section 10­A of the Act
and   further   stipulated   that   the   next   batch   of   students   in
various   courses   be   admitted   in   the   College   only   after   the
permission   of   the   Central   Government   for   renewal   and
fulfilling   of   the   stipulated   conditions.     Be   it   stated,   the
conditions   that   were   imposed   by   the   Oversight   Committee
were   incorporated   in   the   letter   of   respondent   No.   1.   The
conditions imposed by the Oversight Committee read:
“(i)   An   affidavit   from   the   Dean/Principal   and
Chairman   of   the   Trust   /   Society/   University/
Company etc concerned, affirming fulfillment of
all   deficiencies   and   statements   made   in   the
respective compliance report submitted to MHFW
by 22 June 2016.
(ii) A bank guarantee in the amount of Rs. 2 crore
in favour of MCI, which will be valid for 1 year or
until the first renewal assessment, whichever is
later. Such bank guarantee will be in addition to
the   prescribed   fee   submitted   alongwith   the
application. 
2. The OC has also stipulated as follows:­
(i)   OC   may   direct   inspection   to   verify   the
compliance   submitted   by   the   College   and
considered by OC, anytime after 30 September
2016.
(ii) In default of the conditions (i) and (ii) in para 1
above   and   if   the   compliances   are   found
incomplete   in   the   inspection   to   be   conducted8
after 30 September 2016, such college will   be
debarred from fresh intake of students for 2 years
commencing 2017­18.” 
6.It is the stand of the petitioner No. 2 that it had complied
with the conditions imposed by the Oversight Committee and
also furnished the bank guarantee in favour of the second
respondent. In the meantime, students admitted in the first
batch had completed the course and were ready to appear for
their   final   professional   MBBS   University   examination   in
February, 2017 and in this factual background, it applied for
grant of approval and recognition under Section 11(2) of the
Act.
7.  It   is   contended   by   the   petitioner   No.   2   that   after
receiving the application of the college/institute, the MCI is
required to carry out assessment for compliance verification in
the   light   of   assessment   report   dated   19.02.2016   and   to
evaluate the standard of MBBS University Examination and to
assess   the   infrastructural   facilities   available   therein   and
thereafter confer approval and recognition to MBBS degree
with   permission   to   admit   students   during   the   academic9
session   2017­2018.   It   is   averred   that   MCI   inspected   the
institution on 03.02.2017, 17.03.2017 and 18.03.2017 for the
purposes  mentioned   above.  After  evaluation  of   standard  of
examination on 03.02.2017, the assessors submitted a report
in Form ‘C’ and recommended for grant of approval of the
institute. On 17.03.2017 and 18.03.2017 in the compliance
verification   report,   the   assessors   did   not   notice   any   major
deficiency whatsoever but the MCI after perusal of the said
assessment   report   decided   to   recommend   to   the   Central
Government   to   debar   the   petitioner   institute   from   taking
admission   of   students   in   MBBS   course   for   the   next   two
sessions, that is, 2017­2018 and 2018­2019.  The Executive
Committee of the MCI took note of the assessors report which
has noted the following:
“1.There were only 08 Major Operations for the
whole hospital on day of assessment.
2.ICUs: There were only 2 patients each in SICU,
NICU, PICU on day of assessment.
3.Radio   diagnosis   department:   4   Static   X­ray
machines are available against requirement of 5.  2
USG machines are available against requirement of
3. 10
4.Students Hostels: Available accommodation is
less than required as detailed in the report Study
room does not have Computer with Internet & is not
air­conditioned.
5.Interns’   Hostel:   Available   accommodation   is
less than required. Hostels are not furnished.  Toilet
facilities are inadequate. Visitors’ room, AC. Study
room   with   Computer   &   Internet   and   Recreation
room are not available.
6.Nurses’ Hostel: Available accommodation is for
44 against requirement of 48.
7.     MEU:   Infrastructure   facility   in   MEU   is   not
adequate. There is no computer internet facility.
8.Other   deficiencies   as   pointed   out   in   the
assessment report.”
8.Thereafter the Executive Committee opined thus:
“In view of the above, the college has failed to abide
by the undertaking it had given to the Central Govt.
that there are no deficiencies as per clause 3.2(i) of
the   directions   passed   by   the   Supreme   Court
mandated Oversight Committee vide communication
dated 12/08/2016.  The Executive Committee, after
due deliberation and discussion, has decided that
the college has failed to comply with the stipulation
laid down by the Oversight Committee.  Accordingly,
the Executive Committee recommends that as per
the   directions  passed  by   Oversight   Committee   in
para 3.2(b) vide communication  dated 12/08/2016
the   college   should   be   debarred   from   admitting
students in the above course for a period of two
academic years i.e. 2017­18 and 2018­19 as even

the Academic year 2016­17 with reference to the
conditional   approval   accorded   by   Oversight
Committee,   the   college   was   found   to   be   grossly
deficient. It has also been decided by the Executive
Committee that the Bank Guarantee furnished by
the college in pursuance of the directives passed by
the Oversight Committee as well as GOI letter dated
20/08/2016 is liable to be encashed.”
A copy of the recommendation was sent to the Principal
of the petitioner institute.
9.After   receiving   the   communication   from   the   MCI,
petitioner   No.   2   vide   letter   dated   04.04.2017   submitted   a
detailed   representation   to   the   Oversight   Committee
highlighting   the   unjustified   decision   of   the   Executive
Committee of MCI with regard to compliance verification. A
communication  was  also  sent  to  respondent  No.  1.  In  the
meantime,   the   petitioner   received   a   communication   dated
07.04.2017   issued   by   the   first   respondent   granting   an12
opportunity   of   personal   hearing   on   13.04.2017.   The
petitioners appeared before the respondent No. 1 on the date
fixed and furnished the requisite information and reiterated
the stand that the petitioner No. 2 institute is fully compliant
with the MCI rules and regulations and clarified the position
relating   to   deficiencies   which   were   noted   as   per   the
assessment report on 03.02.2017.   It also highlighted that the
assessment   reports   of   17.03.2017   and   18.03.2017   did   not
justify  denial   of  grant   of  permission   and   in  any   case,   the
institution   had   taken   measures   to   remove   the   said
deficiencies.  It was asserted that the compliance report dated
12.04.2017   of   the   institute   clearly   established   that   all   the
deficiencies have been removed by 12.04.2017.
10.According to the petitioners, on 24.04.2017 officers of
respondent   No.   2   without   prior   intimation   conducted   an
assessment flouting all norms. The report dated 24.04.2017
which is named as Compliance Verification Assessment of the
petitioner­College by the MCI noted certain major deficiencies
which are as follows:13
“1.Deficiency of faculty is 61.32% as detailed in
the report.
2.Shortage of Residents is 36.06% as detailed in
the report.
3.Bed Occupancy is 45.95% at 10 a.m. on the
day of assessment.
4. Most of the wards are not as per MSR.
5.In Obst. & Gynae wards, pediatric wards and
orthopedic   wards   patients   have   minor
complaints   did   not   required   admission,   in
obstetrics   wards   elderly   lay   admitted   in   the
wards   (college   authority   not   provide   a   case
sheet about this). Hospital internal condition is
non­hygienic.
6.There were only 05 Major Operations on day of
assessment.
7.Data   of   Laboratory   &   Radiological
investigations   provided   by   the   Institute   are
inflated.
8.IPD attendance data provided by Institute are

11.The   Executive   Committee   in   its   meeting   held   on
30.04.2017   considered   the   compliance   verification   report
dated 24.04.2017 along with previous assessment report (17th
& 18th March, 2017) and noted :
“In view of the above,   the  Executive Committee of
the Council decided to recommended to the Central
Government   not   to   recognize/approve   ICARE14
Institute of Medical Sciences & Research, Haldia,
West Bengal for the award of MBBS degree (100
seats)   granted   by   The   West   Bengal   University   of
Health Sciences, Kolkata u/s 11(2) of the IMC Act,
1956   and   further   decided   that   the   Institute   be
asked to submit the compliance for rectification of
the above deficiencies within 01 month for further
consideration of the matter.
However in view of above, the Executive Committee
to reiterate its earlier decision to recommend to the
Central Govt, that the college should be debarred
from admitting students in the above course for a
period of two academic years i.e. 2017­ 18 & 2018­
19 as per directions passed by Oversight Committee
in   Para   3.2(b)   vide   communication   dated
12.08.2016.""
12.Inspection carried out by the MCI on 24.04.2017 was
brought to the notice of the Oversight Committee highlighting
that the assessment carried out on the said date was factually
incorrect and not in good faith.  Criticism was advanced about
the inspection of 24.04.2017 on the foundation that despite
assessments   carried   out   on   03.02.2017,   17.03.2017   and
18.03.2017,   a   surprise   and   perfunctory   verification   was
carried out.   As the factual narration would uncurtain, the
respondent No. 1 vide letter dated 31.05.2017 intimated the
petitioner No. 2 College that the Central Government decided
not to permit admission of students in the MBBS course (10015
course)   for   the   academic   year   2017­2018   with   the   further
stipulation that the admission made against the decision of
the Central Government will be treated as irregular and action
will   be   initiated   under   the   Act   and   Regulations   made
thereunder. Examples have been cited in the Writ Petition,
how the other institutions who had suffered from significant
deficiencies have been granted the Letter of Permission and
action of the respondents have been characterized as   mala
fide.
13.It is necessary to state here that after the matter was
sent   for   reconsideration,   the   Central   Government   granted
hearing to the college on 22.08.2017 and took the assistance
of the newly constituted Oversight Committee as per the order
of   the   Constitution   Bench.   The   Hearing   Committee   after
considering   the   report   and   submissions   of   the   College
submitted its report by stating that there was no merit for
reconsideration of the case for renewal and it concurred with
the decision taken by the Ministry on earlier occasion.   The
decision of the Hearing Committee has been enclosed with the16
order dated 29.08.2017. The report of the Hearing Committee
also   mentioned   the   tabular.   We   think   it   appropriate   to

14.Assailing   the   decisions   of   the   MCI   and   the   Central
Government, it is submitted by Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned
senior counsel appearing for the petitioner No.1 and Mr. R.S.
Suri, learned senior counsel for the petitioner No. 2 submit
that   the   institution   was   found   fully   compliant   as   per   the
inspection   made   on   03.02.2017   and   surprise   inspections
carried   out   on   17.03.2017   and   18.03.2017   and   the   said
inspections have to be understood in law as assessment for
grant   of   recognition   under   Section   11(2)   of   the   Act   and
compliance verification assessment for renewal of permission19
for admission of 6th batch  (100 seats) of MBBS course under
Section   10­A   of   the   Act   and   hence,   further   inspection   on
24.04.2017 has no legal acceptation. That apart, submits Dr.
Dhawan, the initial communication of the MCI though made
within 11 days of the inspection, it, despite its obligation to
obtain the approval of the Oversight Committee, had debarred
the   institution   from  admitting   students   and  encashing   the
bank   guarantee   which   exhibits   absolute   arbitrariness   and
makes the decision wholly vulnerable. It is contended that  the
recommendation made was contrary to the fact situation and,
therefore, to justify its stand, the assessors of the MCI being
so directed carried out routine assessment which is neither
supportable in law nor does it stand to reason. Learned senior
counsel   is   extremely   critical   of   such   kind   of   inspection
because it does not follow any procedure and reveals the pre­
determined mind of the assessors and, in any case, the object
of the MCI, as is evident, was to prove its point and not to
objectively perceive things so that the medical education in
this country can achieve real stability. He has referred to the20
compliance report of 12.04.2017 as it would be indicative of
the fact that the deficiencies have been rectified. It is put forth
by Dr. Dhawan that the Central Government despite the order
passed by this Court in  IQ City Foundation & Anr. v. Union
of India and Ors.2  has   not   really   kept   itself   alive  to   the
principles   stated   by   this   Court   and   acted   not   only
unreasonably but in a high­handed manner.  Learned senior
counsel   would   submit   that   the   order   dated   29.08.2017
deserves to be axed because it is cryptic and unreasonable as
it has not taken into account the materials submitted before
the   Hearing   Committee   in   the   form   of   attendance   record,
salary   statements,   Forms   16A   (TDS),   clinical   records   and
certain other documents which speak eloquently about the
compliance of initial deficiencies pointed out by the assessors.
It is urged by him that the whole action of the MCI is  mala fide
and is incapable of withstanding scrutiny.  
15.Refuting the submissions of Dr. Dhawan, it is contended
by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel along with Mr.
2 (2017) 8 SCALE 36921
Gaurav   Sharma,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   MCI
contended that the aspersions made by the petitioners on the
inspection held on 24.04.2017 do not deserve consideration
since it is the duty of the MCI to see that the institutions
remain ever compliant. Attribution of   mala fide  is absolutely
unwarranted, for the assessors of MCI had gone on surprise
verification as the College submitted the compliance report
which stated that the deficiencies had been removed.  Learned
senior   counsel   would   submit   that   the   experts   enjoy   great
reputation in their field and the bald allegations should not be
allowed to destroy the basic purpose for which the inspection
is meant for and it is the statutory responsibility of the MCI to
scrutinize   at   the   spot   about   the   due   compliance   report.
Placing reliance on certain authorities which we shall refer to
in due course, contends Mr. Singh, that a minute inspection of
the contents of the report is not permissible in law unless
prima facie it is reflective of total unacceptability or perversity.
The learned counsel has drawn the distinction between Letter
of Permission at the commencement of the college and at a22
renewal stage and further at the final recognition stage.   He
has   pressed   into   service   the   language   employed   in   the
provisions of the Act and the Establishment of Medical College
Regulations, 1999 (for short, “the Regulations”) framed under
the said Act to strengthen the stand that an institution having
deficiencies which are unacceptable cannot be extended the
benefit   of   recognition.   It   is   his   further   contention   that   an
institution which is granted LOP for the initial establishment,
certain deficiencies to some extent be ignored but as it moves
from initial stage to another the yardsticks that apply are more
rigorous. 
16.Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General
defending   the   order   passed   by   the   Central   Government
canvassed that the order in present incarnation cannot be
characterized   as   an   unreasoned   one   because   it   has
chronologically referred to the background and taken note of
the Oversight Committee which consists of eminent doctors as
per   the   decision   of   this   Court   passed   by   the   Constitution
Bench in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 408 of 2017 titled   Amma23
Chandravati   Educational   and   Charitable   Trust   and
others v. Union of India and another . It is argued by him
that   when   the   eminent   doctors   have   evaluated   all   the
verification inspection reports and arrived at the conclusion
and the Central Government concurred with it by taking note
of every facet to call it an unreasoned order is not only unfair
but,   in   a   way   uncharitable.   According   to   Mr.   Singh,   the
recommendations made by the MCI being well considered and
based on materials have been accepted by the respondent No.
1 and in such circumstances the order passed by it should be
treated as impeccable, warranting no interference.  
17.We have already narrated the facts in a chronological
manner. What grieves the petitioners is the inspection caused
on 24.04.2017.  The gravamen of the proponement is that the
said inspection in the name of verification is an outcome of
mala fides and hence, legally illegitimate. The stance taken to
pyramid the point is that it is not permissible under the Act or
the   Regulations,  and  the  assessors  nominated  by  the  MCI
have   carried   out   inspection   not   only   in   total   violation   of24
principles of natural justice but also totally abandoning their
sense of objectivity.   As the chronicle  of  the factual score
would depict, the institution had filed a “compliance report” on
12.04.2017.   The   said   compliance   report   referred   to
communication of MCI dated 28.03.2017 in respect of grant of
renewal/approval to the  petitioner  College. The  said  report
after mentioning about the minor deficiencies pointed out by
the assessors stated:
“So   far   as   the   deficiencies   pointed   out   by   the
assessors after their assessment of infrastructures
on 17/18 March, 2017 vide their report in Format
A­II is concerned, they are not in major natures
which   may   justify   denial   of   grant   of   recognition.
They are not in respect of staff, space, equipment,
college/hospital   and   clinical   material.   It   is   not
practical   to   insist   for   a   full   proof   or   absolute
adherence   to   all   requirements   without   regard   to
their   importance   for   the   purpose   of   imparting
education, in a practical way. However, since we
have already removed the deficiencies a compliance
report in tabular form is being submitted herewith.
It is important to mention here that the Assessors
have   not   found   any   deficiency   in   teaching   staff.
They have pointed out in their report shortage of
3.8% teaching faculty and 1.5% of resident doctors
which are permissible as per MCI rules.
Under   the   facts   and   circumstances   mentioned
above,   you   are   requested   to   kindly   accept   the
compliance report and if deemed necessary grant25
personal hearing to us in the matter for the ends of
natural justice.”
Be it noted, the compliance report contained annexures
and the soft copy in word format and in CD.  At this juncture,
as the MCI would contend, it felt the necessity to conduct a
surprise inspection to satisfy itself as regards the compliance
on 24.04.2017.  We already have reproduced the same.  
18.To appreciate the controversy in apposite perspective, it
is extremely crucial to understand the scheme of the Act and
how the same has been understood and appreciated by this
Court.  Section 3 of the MCI Act deals with constitution and
composition of the MCI. Section 10 provides the constitution of
the   Executive   Committee   and   further   stipulates   that   in
addition to the powers and duties conferred and imposed upon
it by the Act, the Committee shall exercise and discharge such
powers and duties as the Council may confer or impose upon
it by Regulations which may be made in that behalf.  Section
10­A(1)   provides   for   permission   for   establishment   of   new
medical college and new course of study.   It stipulates that
notwithstanding anything contained in the Act or any other26
law for the time being in force, no person shall establish a
medical college or no medical college shall open a new or
higher   course   of   study   or   training   including   post­graduate
course of study or training or increase its admission capacity
in any course of study or training except with the previous
permission of the Central Government obtained in accordance
with the provisions of the said section. Section 10­A(2) lays the
postulate that every person or medical college shall, for the
purpose of obtaining permission under sub­section (1), submit
to the Central Government a scheme in accordance with the
provisions   of   clause   (b)   of   Section   3   and   the   Central
Government   shall   refer   the   scheme   to   the   MCI   for   its
recommendations. 
19.Sub­section (3) and sub­section (7) of Section 10­A deal
with the role of the MCI on receipt of a scheme.  Sub­section
(3), (4) and sub­section (7) of Section 10­A read as follows :
“(3) On receipt of a scheme by the Council under
sub­section   (2)   the   Council   may   obtain   such
other particulars as may be considered necessary
by   it   from   the   person   or   the   medical   college
concerned, and thereafter, it may—27
 (a) if   the   scheme   is   defective   and   does   not
contain   any   necessary   particulars,   give   a
reasonable opportunity to the person or college
concerned   for   making   a   written   representation
and it shall be open to such person or medical
college to rectify the defects, if any, specified by
the Council. 
(b) consider the scheme, having regard to the
factors referred to in sub­section (7) and submit
the scheme together with its recommendations
thereon to the Central Government.
xxxxx
(7)The   Council,   while   making   its
recommendations under clause (b) of sub­section
(3) and the Central Government, while passing an
order,   either   approving   or   disapproving   the
scheme   under   sub­section   (4),   shall   have   due
regard to the following factors, namely:­ 
(a) whether the proposed medical college or the
existing medical college seeking to open a new or
higher course of study or training, would be in a
position   to   offer   the   minimum   standards   of
medical education as prescribed by the Council
under section 19A or, as the case may be under
section 20 in the case of postgraduate medical
education. 
(b) whether the person seeking to establish a
medical   college   or   the   existing   medical   college
seeking to open a new or higher course of study
or training or to increase it admission capacity
has adequate financial resources; 
(c) whether   necessary   facilities   in   respect   of
staff,   equipment,   accommodation,   training   and
other facilities to ensure proper functioning of the
medical college or conducting the new course or28
study   or   training   or   accommodating   the
increased   admission   capacity,   have   been
provided or would be provided within the time­
limit specified in the scheme. 
(d) whether adequate hospital facilities, having
regard to the number or students likely to attend
such   medical   college   or   course   of   study   or
training or as a result of the increased admission
capacity,   have   been   provided   or   would   be
provided   within   the   time­limit   specified   in   the
scheme; 
(e) whether any arrangement has been made or
programme drawn to impart proper training to
students likely to attend such medical college or
course of study or training by persons having the
recognised medical qualifications; 
(f) the requirement of manpower in the field of
practice of medicine; and 
(g) any other factors as may be prescribed.”
20.Sub­section (4) of Section 8 deals with the power of the
Central Government.  It reads :
“(4)The Central Govt. may after considering the
scheme and the recommendations of the Council
under sub­section (3) and after obtaining, where
necessary,   such   other   particulars   as   may   be
considered necessary by it from the person or
college   concerned,   and   having   regard   to   the
factors   referred   to   in   sub­section   (7),   either
approve 4 (with such conditions, if any, as it may
consider necessary ) or disapprove the scheme,29
and   any   such   approval   shall   be   a   permission
under sub­section (1): 
Provided that no scheme shall be disapproved by
the Central Government except after giving the
person   or   college   concerned   a   reasonable
opportunity of being heard; 
Provided further that nothing in this sub section
shall   prevent   any   person   or   medical   college
whose   scheme   has   not   been   approved   by   the
Central Government to submit a fresh scheme
and the provisions of this section shall apply to
such   scheme,   as   if   such   scheme   has   been
submitted  for  the   first   time   under   sub­section
(2).”
21.Section   10­A   has   been   interpreted   in   Royal   Medical
Trust (Registered) and Anr v. Union of India & Anr3. The
said decision also reflects on the Regulations framed by the
MCI.    The Court has ruled that  the  MCI and  the  Central
Government, having vested with the monitoring powers under
Section   10­A   of   the   Act,   they   are   required   to   show   due
diligence right from the day when the applications are received
and the schedule giving various stages and the time limit must
accommodate every possible eventuality and at the same time
must comply with the requirement of observance of principles
3 (2015) 10 SCC 1930
of natural justice at various levels.  The Court, in this regard,
has expressed thus:
“31. MCI and the Central Government have been
vested with monitoring powers under Section 10A
and   the   Regulations.   It   is   expected   of   these
authorities   to   discharge   their   functions   well
within   the   statutory   confines   as   well   as   in
conformity with the Schedule to the Regulations.
If   there   is   inaction   on   their   part   or   non­
observance of the time schedule, it is bound to
have adverse effect on all concerned. The affidavit
filed on behalf of the Union of India shows that
though the number of seats had risen, obviously
because of permissions granted for establishment
of new colleges, because of disapproval of renewal
cases the resultant effect was net loss in terms of
number of seats available for the academic year.
It thus not only caused loss of opportunity to the
students community but at the same time caused
loss to the society in terms of less number of
doctors   being   available.   MCI   and   the   Central
Government must therefore show due diligence
right   from   the   day   when   the   applications   are
received. The Schedule giving various stages and
time­limits   must   accommodate   every   possible
eventuality and at the same time must comply
with the requirements of observance of natural
justice at various levels. In our view the Schedule
must ideally take care of:
 
(A) Initial assessment of the application at the
first level should comprise of checking necessary
requirements   such   as   essentiality   certificate,
consent for affiliation and physical features like
land and hospital requirement. If an applicant
fails to fulfil these requirements, the application31
on the face of it, would be incomplete and be
rejected. Those who fulfil the basic requirements
would be considered at the next stage.
(B) Inspection should then be conducted by the
Inspectors   of   MCI.   By   very   nature   such
inspection   must   have   an   element   of   surprise.
Therefore sufficient time of about three to four
months   ought   to   be   given   to   MCI   to   cause
inspection   at   any   time   and   such   inspection
should   normally   be   undertaken   latest   by
January. Surprise inspection would ensure that
the   required   facilities   and   infrastructure   are
always   in   place   and   not   borrowed   or   put   in
temporarily.
(C) Intimation of  the  result  or outcome  of the
inspection would then be communicated. If the
infrastructure   and   facilities   are   in   order,   the
medical   college   concerned   should   be   given
requisite permission/renewal. However, if there
are any deficiencies or shortcomings, MCI must,
after pointing out the deficiencies, grant to the
college   concerned   sufficient   time   to   report
compliance.
(D) If compliance is reported and the applicant
states that the deficiencies stand removed, MCI
must cause compliance verification. It is possible
that   such   compliance   could   be   accepted   even
without   actual   physical   verification   but   that
assessment be left entirely to the discretion of
MCI and the Central Government. In cases where
actual physical verification is required, MCI and
the   Central   Government   must   cause   such
verification before the deadline.32
(E) The result of such verification if positive in
favour   of   the   medical   college   concerned,   the
applicant   ought   to   be   given   requisite
permission/renewal. But if the deficiencies still
persist or had not been removed, the applicant
will stand disentitled so far as that academic year
is concerned.”
The aforesaid authority makes it clear as day that the
surprise inspection is conceived of within the scheme of the
Act   and   the   institution/college   is   required   to   remain
compliant.  
22.In Manohar Lal Sharma  v. Medical Council of India
& Ors.4, it has been ruled that the MCI on the basis of the
reports regular compliance is legally obliged to form an opinion
with regard to the capacity of the College to provide necessary
facilities   in   respect   of   staff,   equipments,   accommodation,
training and other facilities to ensure proper functioning of the
medical college or for increase of admission capacity.  In the
said   case,   the   Court   while   dealing   with   the   surprise
inspection, has expressed thus:­
4  (2013) 10 SCC 6033
“24.  Surprise   inspection,   in   this   case,   was
conducted   to   ascertain   whether   compliance
report   could   be   accepted   and   to   ascertain
whether   the   deficiencies   pointed   out   in   the
regular   inspection   were   rectified   or   not.   By
pointing out the deficiencies, MCI is giving an
opportunity   to   the   College   to   rectify   the
deficiencies,   if   any   noticed   by   the   inspection
team. It is the duty of the College to submit the
compliance   report,   after   rectifying   the
deficiencies.   MCI   can   conduct   a   surprise
inspection to ascertain whether the deficiencies
had been rectified and the compliance report be
accepted or not.”
 
Eventually, the Court held:
“27. We are also of the view that such an order is
not vitiated by violation of principles of natural
justice, especially, when no allegation of bias or
mala fide has  been  attributed against the  two
doctors   who   constituted   the   inspection   team,
which conducted the surprise inspection on 6­7­
2013. When the inspection team consists of two
doctors   of   unquestionable   integrity   and
reputation, who are experts in the field, there is
no   reason   to   discard   the   report   of   such
inspection. In such circumstances, we are of the
view   that   MCI   has   rightly   passed   the   order
rejecting the approval for renewal of permission
for the third batch of 150 MBBS students granted
for the academic year 2013­2014.”
[Emphasis added]
23.In this context, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel
for the MCI, has drawn our attention to Regulation 7 which34
deals with the report of the MCI.   He has also drawn our
attention to Regulation 8 that pertains to grant of permission
by the Central Government.  Regulation 8, has been amended
on 8.2.2016 and 8.3.2016. We think it appropriate to extract
the relevant clauses:
“(1)   The   Central   Government,   on   the
recommendation   of   the   Council   for   Letter   of
Permission, may issue a letter to set up a new
medical   college   with   such   18   conditions   or
modifications in the original proposal as may be
considered necessary. This letter can also include
a clear cut statement of preliminary requirements
to be met in respect of buildings, infrastructural
facilities, medical and allied equipments, faculty
and   staff   before   admitting   the   first   batch   of
students. The formal permission may be granted
after the above conditions and modifications are
accepted  and   the  performance   bank  guarantee
for   the   required   sums   are   furnished   by   the
person and after consulting the Medical Council
of India. 
(2) The formal permission may include a time
bound programme for the establishment of the
medical   college   and   expansion   of   the   hospital
facilities. The permission may also define annual
targets   as   may   be   fixed   by   the   Council   to   be
achieved by the person to commensurate with the
intake of students during the following years.” 
24.Sub­clause (3)(1) provides that  : 
“(3)(1)   The   permission   to   establish   a   medical
college   and   admit   students   may   be   granted35
initially   for   a   period   of   one   year   and   may   be
renewed on yearly basis subject to verification of
the achievements of annual targets.   It shall be
the responsibility of the person to apply to the
Medical Council of India for purpose of renewal
six   months   prior   to   the   expiry   of   the   initial
permission. This process of renewal of permission
will continue till such time the establishment of
the medical college and expansion of the hospital
facilities are completed and a formal recognition
of   the   medical   college   is   granted.   Further
admissions shall not be made at any stage unless
the requirements of the Council are fulfilled.  The
Central Government may at any stage convey the
deficiencies to the applicant and provide him an
opportunity and time to rectify the deficiencies.”
[Underlining is by us]
25.Vide Gazette Notification dated 18.3.2016, clause 8(3)((1)
(a) was substituted thus :
“(a) Colleges in the stage of Letter of Permission
upto II renewal (i.e. Admission of third batch) 
If   it   is   observed   during   any
inspection/assessment of the institute that the
deficiency of teaching faculty and/or Residents is
more than 30% and/or bed occupancy is < 50%
(45%   in   North   East,   Hilly   terrain,   etc.),
compliance   of   rectification   of   deficiencies   from
such an institute will not be considered for issue
of   Letter   of   Permission   (LOP)/renewal   of
permission in that Academic Year.”36
26.Clause 8(3)(1)(b) was also substituted which reads
thus :
 “(b) Colleges in the stage of III & IV renewal (i.e.
Admission of fourth & fifth batch) 
If   it   is   observed   during   any   inspection   of   the
Institute that the deficiency of teaching faculty
and / or Residents is more than 20% and / or
bed   occupancy   is   <   65%  compliance   of
rectification of deficiencies from such an institute
will not be considered for renewal of permission
in that Academic Year.” 
27.Clause   8(3)(1)(c),   after   the   amendment,   reads   as
follows:
“(c) Colleges   which   are   already   recognized   for
award   of   M.B.B.S.   degree   and   /   or   running
Postgraduate courses. 
If   it   is   observed   during   any   inspection   /
assessment of the institute that the deficiency of
teaching faculty and / or Residents is more than
10%   and   /   or   bed   occupancy   is   <   70%
compliance   of   rectification   of   deficiency   from
such an institute will not be considered for issue
of renewal of permission in that Academic Year
and   further   such   an   institute   will   not   be
considered   for   processing   applications   for
Postgraduate courses in that Academic Year and
will be issued show cause notices as to why the
recommendations for withdrawal of recognition of
the courses run by that institute should not be
made   for   undergraduate   and   postgraduate
courses which are recognized u/s 11(2) of the37
IMC Act, 1956 along with direction of stoppage of
admissions in permitted postgraduate courses.”
“However, the office of the Council shall ensure
that such inspections are not carried out at least
2 days before and 2 days after important religious
and   festival   holidays   declared   by   the
Central/State Govt.”
28.Clause (4) is as follows:
“(4) The   Council   may   obtain   any   other
information from the proposed medical college as
it deems fit and necessary. 
RECONSIDERATION  
Wherever   the   Council   in   its   report   has   not
recommended the issue of Letter of Intent to the
person, it may upon being so required by the
Central   Government   reconsider   the   application
and   take   into   account   new   or   additional
information as may be forwarded by the Central
Government.   The   Council   shall,   thereafter,
submit   its   report   in   the   same   manner   as
prescribed for the initial report.”
29.Regulation 8(3)(1) has been added by Gazette Notification
dated   08.02.2016   which   stipulates   that   permission   to
establish a medical college and admit students may be granted
initially for a period of one year and may be renewed on an
yearly   basis   subject   to   verification   of   the   achievement   of
targets.   It   also   provides   that   the   process   of   renewal   of38
permission to continue till such time the establishment of the
medical college and expansion of the hospital facilities are
completed, and thereafter a formal recognition of the medical
college is granted.  It clearly lays down that further admission
shall not be made at any stage unless the requirements of the
Council are fulfilled and the Central Government may at any
stage convey the deficiencies to the college and provide an
opportunity and time to rectify the deficiencies.  
30.Sub­section (3)(1) contains certain provisos.   They read
as follows :­
“PROVIDED that in respect of 
(a) Colleges in the stage upto II renewal (i.e.
Admission of third batch) : 
If it is observed during any regular inspection of
the   institute   that   the   deficiency   of   teaching
faculty   and/or   Residents   is   more   than   30%
and/or bed occupancy is 60 %, such an institute
will not be considered for renewal of permission
in that Academic Year. 
(b) Colleges in the stage from III renewal (i.e.
Admission of fourth batch) till recognition of
the institute for award of M.B;B.S. degree : 
If it is observed during any regular inspection of
the   institute   that   the   deficiency   of   teaching
faculty   and/or   Residents   is   more   than   20%39
and/or   bed   occupancy   is   <   70   %,   such   an
institute   will   not   be   considered   for   renewal   of
permission in that Academic Year. 19 
(c) Colleges which are already recognized for
award   of   M.B.B.S.   degree   and/or   running
Postgraduate Courses : 
If it is observed during any regular inspection of
the   institute   that   the   deficiency   of   teaching
faculty   and/or   Residents   is   more   than   10%
and/or   bed   occupancy   is   <   80%,   such   an
institute   will   not   be   considered   for   processing
applications   for   postgraduate   courses   in   that
Academic Year and will be issued show cause
notices   as   to   why   the   recommendation   for
withdrawal of recognition of the courses run by
that   institute   should   not   be   made   for
Undergraduate and Postgraduate courses which
are recognized u/s 11(2) of the IMC Act, 1956
along with direction of stoppage of admissions in
permitted Postgraduate courses. 
(d) Colleges   which   are   found   to   have
employed   teachers   with   faked/forged
documents: 
If it is observed that any institute is found to
have   employed   a   teacher   with   faked/forged
documents and have submitted the Declaration
Form of such a teacher, such an institute will not
be   considered   for   renewal   of
permission/recognition   for   award   of   M.B.B.S.
degree/processing   the   applications   for
postgraduate courses for two Academic Years –
i.e. that Academic Year and the next Academic
Year also. 
However, the office of the Council shall ensure
that such inspections are not carried out at least40
3   days   before   upto   3   days   after   important
religious   and   festival   holidays   declared   by   the
Central/State Govt.
  (2)   The   recognition   so   granted   to   an
Undergraduate Course for award of MBBS degree
shall be for a maximum period of 5 years, upon
which it shall have to be renewed. 
(3) The procedure for ‘Renewal’ of recognition
shall   be   same   as   applicable   for   the   award   of
recognition. (4) Failure to seek timely renewal of
recognition   as   required  in   subclause   (a)  supra
shall invariably result in stoppage of admissions
to the concerned Undergraduate Course of MBBS
at the said institute.”
As   is   evincible,   the   aforesaid   Regulations   deal   with
various stages and the requirements under Section 10­A and
Section 11 (2) of the Act.
31.The aforesaid Regulations, as we perceive, deal with the
compliance verification.  In the instant case, after the College
submitted that it had complied with deficiencies pointed out
by the team of assessors, the MCI thought it necessary to have
an inspection. It is not in dispute that the said inspection was
a surprise inspection and further it was, as the MCI perceived,
required to be done to verify whether the institution was really
compliant or not. In the verification report dated 24.04.2017,41
as   the   assessors   have   pointed   out,   there   are   number   of
deficiencies.  
32.The stand of the petitioners is that such verification is
impermissible and grossly  mala fide. In  IQ City Foundation
(supra), the three­Judge Bench, after referring to the authority
in  Royal Medical Trust   (supra) has held that the emphasis
on the compliant institutions that can really educate doctors
by imparting quality education so that they will have inherent
as well as the cultivated attributes of excellence. There can be
no scintilla of doubt that an institution that imparts medical
education has to remain ever compliant.   It is necessary to
mention   here   that   in   IQ   City   Foundation  (supra),   a
contention was advanced that when the Central Government
sends back the matter to the MCI for compliance verification,
the power of the MCI is restricted and it is only required to
inspect the aspects for which the matter has been referred
back   by   the   Central   Government.     Negativining   the   said
contention, the Court has held :42
“On a reading of Section 10­A of the Act, Rules
and the   Regulations, as has been referred to in
Manohar   Lal   Sharma   (supra),   and   the   view
expressed   in   Royal   Medical   Trust   (supra),   it
would be inapposite to restrict the power of the
MCI by laying down as an absolute principle that
once   the   Central   Government   sends   back   the
matter to MCI for compliance verification and the
Assessors visit the College they shall only verify
the mentioned items and turn a Nelson’s eye even
if   they   perceive   certain   other   deficiencies.     It
would be playing possum. The direction of the
Central  Government   for compliance  verification
report   should   not   be   construed   as   a   limited
remand as is understood within the framework of
Code of Civil Procedure or any other law. The
distinction   between   the   principles   of   open
remand and limited remand, we are disposed to
think, is not attracted. ”
33.The aforesaid passage lays stress how the educational
institutions are to be compliant to have the requirements as
per the Act and the Regulations and not to take shelter under
a subterfuge or lean upon  a contrived situation  to exhibit
justification. Thus analysed, the grievance agitated pertaining
to surprise inspection with keen acumen does not commend
acceptance.   The   attack   on   the   compliance   report   on
asseverations of  mala fide, if we allow ourselves to say so, does
not deserve acceptance. Whether there is   mala fide  or not,43
depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case as has
been held in   State of Bihar v.  P.P. Sharma, IAS & Anr.5
Mere allegation of   mala fide  does not vitiate an enquiry or
proceeding.   As we see, in the instant case, the allegations
have been made against the assessors who are experts in the
field and we find no reason to attribute any kind of malice or
mala fide  to them.   In the absence of any kind of material
brought   on   record,   the   mere   allegations   that   there   was   a
surprise inspection, within a fortnight, would not make the
inspection a tainted one.  In this regard, we may usefully refer
to   a   passage   from   Medical  Council  of   India  v.  Kalinga
Institute of Medical Sciences6 :
“Our attention was also drawn to the decision of
this  Court in  Manohar Lal  Sharma  v.  Medical
Council of India wherein it was held (SCC p. 72,
para 27) that since the inspection is taken by
“doctors   of   unquestionable   integrity   and
reputation, who are experts in the field, there is
no   reason   to   discard   the   report   of   such   an
inspection”. In the present appeal, there is no
allegation made by KIMS of any mala fides of the
inspection   team   or   any   perversity   in   the
inspection report and hence, there is no question
5  1992 Supp.(1) SCC 222
6 (2011) 11 SCC 53044
of   challenging   the   conclusions   of   a   neutral,
randomly   selected   inspection   team   in   its
assessment.”
And again:
“The   High   Court   did   not   appreciate   that   the
inspection was carried out by eminent Professors
from   reputed   medical   institutions   who   were
experts in the field and the best persons to give
an unbiased report on the facilities in KIMS . The
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution
was certainly not tasked to minutely examine the
contents of the inspection report and weigh them
against the objections of KIMS in respect of each
of its 18 items. In our opinion, the High Court
plainly exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard in
venturing into seriously disputed factual issues.”
[Emphasis supplied]
34.In Royal Medical Trust and another v. Union of India
and another7 this Court held:
“Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of
the   case,   we   sum   up   our   conclusions   and
directions, thus:­
(a)The petitioners are not entitled to Letter Of
Permission (LOP) for the academic session
2017­2018. We direct that the order passed
in   the   present   writ   petition   shall   be
applicable   hereafter   for   the   academic
session 2018­2019 since the cut off date for
admissions  to MBBS  course for academic
7 2017 (11) SCALE 30745
session 2017­2018 is over and the academic
session has commenced.   No petition shall
be   entertained   from   any
institution/college/society/trust   or   any
party for grant of LOP for 2017­2018.   We
say so as the controversy for grant of LOP
for   the   academic   year   2017­2018   should
come to an end and cannot become an event
that defeats time.     The students who are
continuing their studies on the basis of LOP
granted  for the   academic  year  2016­2017
should be allowed to continue their studies
in the college and they shall be permitted to
continue till completion of the course.
(b)The applications submitted for 2017­2018
shall be treated as the application for 2018­
2019   and   the   petitioners   shall   keep   the
bank guarantee deposited with the Medical
Council of India alive and the MCI shall not
encash the same.
(c)The Medical Council of India shall conduct a
fresh   inspection   as   per   the   Regulations
within   a   period   of   two   months.     It   shall
apprise   the   petitioner­institution   with
regard   to   the   deficiencies   and   afford   an
opportunity to comply with the same and,
thereafter, proceed to act as contemplated
under the Act.
(d)The inspection shall be carried out for the
purpose of grant of LOP for the academic
session 2018­2019.
(e)After the Medical Council of India sends its
recommendation   to   the   Central
Government, it shall take the final decision
as per law after affording an opportunity of46
hearing to the petitioners.  Needless to say,
it shall take the assistance of the Hearing
Committee   as   constituted   by   the
Constitution   Bench   decision   in   Amma
Chandravati   Educational   and
Charitable   Trust   (supra)  or   other
directions given in the said decision.”
 The aforesaid directions were issued keeping in view the
deficiencies   in   the   college   therein   and   the   interest   of   the
students. 
35.In  Madha Medical College & Research Institute v.
Union of India8 the Court held :
“At the same time, we are of the view that having
regard to the facts which have transpired, the
petitioner should be permitted to establish before
MCI that it possesses the requisite infrastructure
and has taken all necessary steps to remove the
deficiencies   which   have   been   noted   to   exist.
Such an exercise cannot be carried out in time
for academic year 2017­18 since the last date for
admissions   has   elapsed   and   the   academic
session commenced. Hence the petitioner cannot
be   permitted   to   participate   in   the   counseling
process for the ensuing academic year.  Any such
exercise would necessarily have to be for the ac
academic year 2018­19.”
8 2017 (11) SCALE 330 47
36.In Major S.D. Singh Medical College and Hospital &
Another v. Union of India & another9 it has been said :
“Having   regard   to   the   interest   of   medical
education and the observations contained in the
judgment delivered today by this Court in W.P. (c)
674   of   2017   in   Madha   Medical   College   and
Research Institute through its Managing Director
v. Union of India, we decline to grant any relief in
respect   of   academic   year   2017­18   to   the
petitioner…”
37.In  Karpagam   Faculty   of   Medical   Sciences   &
Research v. Union of India and others10, it has been stated:
“The benchmark and the minimum standards for
these proposals are bound to be different and we
must presume that the expert body,  such as MCI
and the Hearing Committee in which one member
of the OC also participated, were fully aware of
the essentialities and pre­conditions for grant of
recognition/approval.   Since the decision of the
Competent Authority of the Central Government
is based on such inputs, it is not open for us to
sit over that decision as a Court of appeal.” 
38.In  Annaii Medical College & Hospital and Anr. v.
Union of India and another,  Writ Petition (Civil) No. 525 of
9 2017 (11) SCALE 372
10 2107 (11) SCALE 43548
2017, the Court referred to the decision in  Varunarjun Trust
and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.11 and directions  have
been issued as in  Royal Medical Trust7 (supra).
39.As noted earlier, an institution has to remain compliant
and   necessity   for   remaining   compliant   becomes   more
important   as   the   institution   enters   the   renewal   year   and
thereafter for grant of approval and recognition under Section
11(2) of the Act. At the time of consideration of recognition, the
compliance is viewed and scrutinized with great rigour and
strictness. What may be treated as a minor deficiency at the
initial stage may not remain so when the institution/college
proceeds   from   year   to   year.   In   the   instant   case,   we   have
already held that surprise inspection in law is permissible and
the said inspection is not tainted with   mala fide,  as alleged.
Once   we   arrive   at   such   irresistible   conclusion,   the   order
passed by the Central Government with the assistance of the
Hearing Committee cannot be flawed. 
11 W.P . (C) No. 787 of 2017, decided on 12.09.201749
40. Though we have so held, we think it appropriate to direct
that the students who have been admitted in the respective
courses shall be permitted to continue in the courses and the
students who pass out from the institution, the MCI shall see
to it that they are conferred degrees.  The MCI is directed to
conduct   an   inspection   for   recognition   keeping   in   view   the
academic   year   2018­19   and   if   during   the   inspection   any
deficiency   is   noticed,   the   same   shall   be   intimated   to   the
petitioner No. 2 institution and thereafter, process shall be
carried out keeping in view the principles of natural justice in
mind   and   the   principles   stated   in   IQ   City   Foundation
(supra).     The   inspection   shall   be   carried   out   as   per   the
schedule by the MCI for grant of recognition for the academic
year   2018­2019   and   to   avoid   any   kind   of   uncalled   for
situation,   the   application   submitted   for   the   academic   year
2017­2018 shall be treated as application for the academic
year   2018­2019.   The   bank   guarantee   furnished   by   the
institution   shall   not   be   encashed   by   the   MCI   and   the
petitioners shall keep it alive.50
41.The Writ Petition is, accordingly, disposed of. There shall
be no order as to costs.

Deepak Gupta, J.
Leave granted.
2.The present appeal arises from a claim of the landlord –
respondent herein, claiming rent for the period 01.11.2015 to
31.01.2017.  We may point out that another petition was filed by
the   landlord   claiming   rent   for   the   period   01.01.2013   to
30.10.2015.   The landlord claimed rent @ Rs.18,43,900/­ per
month relying upon the lease deed dated 01.01.2013.  The stand
1of the tenant – appellant herein, is that, in fact, there was a
subsequent   registered   lease   deed   dated   01.09.2015   which   is
effective from 01.03.2015 in which the rent is @ Rs.7,50,000/­
per month.  In addition thereto, it is claimed that as per Clause
1(c) of the registered lease deed dated 01.09.2015, the tenant was
entitled to spend an amount of Rs.9 crores for developing the
infrastructure   in   the   tenanted   premises   and   was   entitled   to
adjust the same against the rent.
3.In the eviction petition the Rent Controller determined the
provisional rent @ Rs.7,50,000/­ per month.   The Punjab and
Haryana High Court confirmed the order of the Rent Controller
and the SLP filed against the same was dismissed by this Court.
As far as the registered lease deed of 2015 is concerned, Clause
1(c) of the same reads as follows:­
“1(c)In order to avoid any dispute it is hereby agreed
by and between the parties to these presents, that as
mentioned hereinabove, the Lessor had handed over the
said premises to the Lessee or bareshell basis and THE
LESSEE has agreed to do all the internal work in the
Demised Premises including furnitures and fixtures, air
conditioning,   lighting,   flooring,   false   ceiling,   bathroom
etc. so as to bring it to the standard of and International
Class IT Office.   It has been agreed between the Lessor
and the Lessee that the Lessee shall bear the cost of the
same   which   shall   be   approximately   9   Crores.     This
amount will be payable by the Lessor to the Lessee and
the Lessee shall adjust the same from the rent due to the
Lessor till the entire amount is paid.  Hence the Lessee
will not be liable to pay any rent to the Lessor unless it
2has   recovered   the   entire   amount   of   approximately   9
Crores from the rent due to Lessor.”
After the first petition was decided, the second petition was filed
claiming rent for the period, 01.11.2015 to 31.01.2017.  The Rent
Controller again fixed the provisional rent @ Rs.7.50 lakhs per
month and the High Court relying upon the earlier orders has
upheld the same.  This order is in challenge before us.
4.Mr.   Maninder   Singh,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the
appellant submits that as per Clause 1(c), the tenant is entitled to
adjust the amount payable to the landlord and that by now more
than Rs. 3 crores have been paid, and in case the entire amount
is paid, the appellant will have no way of recovering this amount,
if it is finally held that the tenant is entitled to adjust the rent
against the amount spent.   He also urged that in the earlier
petition the tenant had not placed on record any material to show
the amount of money spent for developing the infrastructure but
in this petition such material has been placed on record. He also
made various other submissions with regard to the relationship
between the parties but we are not going into the same.  On the
other hand, Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel appearing
for the respondent submits that the lease deed of 2013 should be
3relied upon and cannot be ignored at this stage.   He further
submits that even if rent of Rs.7.50 lakhs has to be paid, the
respondent   Trust   cannot   be   deprived   of   this   rent.     He   also
submits that the second lease deed was executed on behalf of the
Trust by one Shri Ajay Sharma.  According to him, Ajay Sharma
is the same person who had signed the lease deed of 2013 and
Ajay Sharma was removed as the Trustee of the Trust much
before the lease deed of 2015 was executed and registered.  On
the other hand, Mr. Maninder Singh contends that, in fact, Ajay
Sharma’s removal is not proper and he is fully empowered to
execute and register the sale deed.  
5.There are various disputed issues involved.  At the outset,
we may note that the lease deed of 2013 relied upon by the
landlord is an un­registered one, and we are not sure if it is
properly stamped and, therefore, at this stage the said lease deed
cannot be relied upon, being inadmissible in evidence. The first
issue is whether the lease deed of 2013 or the lease deed of 2015
will govern the rights of the parties.  The second issue is whether
Shri Ajay Sharma was a trustee and entitled to execute the lease
deed of 2015.  The third issue would be that even if the lease deed
of 2015 governs the rights of the parties, what amount has been
4spent by the appellant.  Here, it would be pertinent to add that
whereas in the first petition the appellant had led no evidence to
show   that   he   had   spent   any   amount,   in   this   petition   some
material has been placed on record.  However, all this will have to
be tested by leading evidence.  We are of the view that all these
contentious issues cannot be decided at this stage.  Evidence will
have to be led by the parties to prove their case.  Equities must be
balanced at this stage, and we feel that the equities must be
balanced in such a manner that when the final petition is decided
both the parties should not be put to loss.
6.In view of the above, we dispose of this appeal with the
following directions :­
(i)That after the period of the first eviction petition in
which it has been held that Rs.7.50 lakhs per month should be
paid by  the  tenant  as  provisional  rent,  we  direct  that  w.e.f.
01.11.2015, the tenant shall be liable to pay rent @ Rs.3.75
lakhs per month;
(ii)This order shall be complied with till the proceedings
are finally disposed of by the Rent Controller and the landlord
shall not be required to file any separate eviction petition for the
subsequent periods;
5(iii)We direct that the tenant shall deposit rent @ Rs.3.75
lakhs   per   month   from   01.11.2015   till   30.11.2019,   after
adjusting   any   payment   which   may   have   been   made   by
31.01.2020.
(v)The tenant shall also furnish tangible surety in a sum
of Rs.3 crores to the Rent Controller so that if the case is decided
against the tenant, the landlord does not have to run after him
to collect the money.
(vi)The Rent Controller is directed to take up the matter
on an urgent basis and, if necessary, try the same on day­to­day
basis and dispose of the same within 6 months from today.
7.With the above directions, the Civil Appeal stands disposed
of.  Pending application(s) if any, shall also stand disposed of.

1 1Court   of   Judicature   at   Allahabad   in   CMWP   No.
49599 of 2011 whereby the High Court allowed the

petitioner   and   respondent   No.   2   herein   is

5.The appellant is the Assistant Provident Fund
Commissioner   of the Employees’ Provident Fund
under   the   Employees’   Provident   Funds   and
Miscellaneous   Provisions   Act,   1952     (hereinafter

the work of loading and unloading in the Godowns,
are entitled to claim the benefit of the Act and, if so,
whether   the   Corporation   is   liable   to   pay   the
statutory contribution in relation to such workers in
accordance with the provisions of the Act so as to
entitle the workers to claim the benefits of the Act. 
9.The   appellant   with   a   view   to   decide   this
question   accordingly   issued   notice   to   the
Corporation under Section 7A of the Act and called
upon them to pay the arrears due towards provident
fund   contribution   of   these   workers   (159)   in
accordance with the provisions of the Act.
10.The   Corporation   contested   the   show   cause
notice inter alia on the ground that since there was
no relationship of employer and employee between
4 4the Corporation and these workers, the Corporation
was   not   liable   to   pay   any   contribution   of   these
workers under the Act. 
11.The   Corporation   also   pointed   out   that   the
question   as   to   whether   these   workers   were   the
employees of the Corporation or not was already
gone   into   between   the   parties   before   the   Labour
Court   in   adjudication   Case   Nos.   89/2006   and
3/2009 and the same was decided by the Labour
Court in workers’ favour but later the award of the
Labour Court was set aside by the High Court by
order dated 15.05.2013 in W.P. No 72314 of 2010.
It is on this basis, the Corporation contended that
in the light of this finding having been recorded by
the   High   Court   in   their   favour,   the   present
proceedings initiated under Section 7A of the Act
against the Corporation are wholly devoid of any
merit and hence the proceedings be withdrawn.   
5 512.   By assessment order dated 02.12.2002, the
adjudicating   authority   did   not   accept   the
contentions raised by the Corporation and held that
the Corporation was liable to pay the contribution of
these workers in accordance with the provisions of
the Act. The appellate authority constituted under
the Act upheld the order, which gave rise to filing of
the   writ  petition  by  the  Corporation  in  the  High
Court of Allahabad. 
13.By impugned order,   the High Court (Single
Judge) allowed the writ petition and set aside the
order of the adjudicating authority and the appellate
authority. The High Court simply placed reliance on
the finding recorded by the High Court in the earlier
proceedings   and   held   that   since   there   was   no
relationship   of   master   and   servant   between   the
Corporation   (as   master)   and   the   workers   (as
servants)   as   was   held   by   the   High   Court   in   the
earlier writ proceedings, the proceedings in question
6 6are   rendered   bad   in   law   and   deserves   to   be
quashed. 
14.It  is  against   this  order,  the  Provident  Fund
Authorities felt aggrieved and filed this appeal by
way of special leave in this Court questioning its
legality and correctness.
15.So   the   short   question,   which   arises   for
consideration in this appeal, is whether the High
Court was justified in allowing the writ petition filed
by the Corporation and thereby was also justified in
setting   aside   the   orders   of   the   adjudicating
authority and the appellate authority.
16.Heard Mr. Keshav Mohan, learned counsel for
the appellant and Mr. P.S. Misra, learned senior
counsel for respondent No.1 and Mr. R.R. Rajesh,
learned counsel for respondent No.2.
17.Having   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are   constrained   to   allow   the   appeal   and   while
7 7setting aside the impugned order remand the case
to the High Court (writ court) for deciding the writ
petition afresh on merits.
18.In our considered opinion, the need to remand
the case to the High Court has arisen for the reason
that   the   High   Court   failed   to   examine   the   issue
keeping   in   view   the   definition   of   “employee""   as
defined under Section 2(f) of the Act which reads as
under:
“2(f)   “employee” means any person who is
employed   for   wages   in   any   kind   of   work,
manual or otherwise, in or in connection with
the work of an establishment, and who gets,
his   wages   directly   or   indirectly   from   the
employer, and includes any person ,­
(i)employed by or through a contractor in
or in connection with the work of the
establishment;
(ii)engaged as an apprentice, not being an
apprentice   engaged   under   the
Apprentices Act, 1961 (52 of 1961), or
under   the   standing   orders   of   the
establishment;”          
     (emphasis supplied)
8 819.In our view, the High Court should have seen
that the proceedings in question have arisen out of
the Act in question and, therefore, the issue was
required to be decided in the light of the relevant
provisions of the Act in question but not in the light
of the finding recorded in the proceedings arising
under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947(hereinafter
referred to as “the ID Act”).
20.The High Court also should have seen that in
order to   decide  the  relationship   of  employer  and
employee for the purpose of applicability of the Act
in question, the issue has to be decided in the light
of definition of  ""employee"" as defined under Section
2(f) of the Act. 
21.It   should   have   been   seen   that   firstly,   the
definition of   ""employee"" under the ID Act is not
identical   to   the   definition   of   “employee”   defined
under Section 2(f) of the Act;   and secondly, the
object of the ID Act and the Act in question is not
9 9the   same.   In   other   words,   the   definition   of
“employee” under the ID Act and the one defined
under the Act in question are not similar.   Even
their objects are also not identical. 
22.It   is   for   these   two   reasons,   any   finding
recorded by the Labour Court while deciding the
dispute under the ID Act will be of no consequence
while deciding the question arising under the Act in
question. The issue was, therefore, required to be
decided independently and  de hors the proceedings
decided under the ID Act. 
23.    Since   the   High   Court   did   not   notice   the
definition of ""employee"" defined under Section 2(f) of
the Act and proceeded to pass the impugned order
only   in   the   light   of   finding   recorded   in   the
proceedings arising under the ID Act in the order
dated 15.05.2013 passed in W.P. No.72314 of 2010,
the impugned order is rendered bad in law and,
therefore, calls for interference in this appeal.
10 1024.In the  light  of  the foregoing discussion, the
appeal   succeeds   and   is   accordingly   allowed.   The
impugned order is set aside. The case (writ petition)
is   remanded   to   the   High   Court   (writ   court)   for
deciding the Corporation's writ petition afresh on
merits keeping in view the definition of ""employee''
as defined under Section 2(f) of the Act and then
decide as to whether the proceedings under section
7A of the Act are legal and proper or not.
25.We request the High Court to decide the writ
petition expeditiously.

JUDGMENT
N.V. RAMANA,  J.
1.These Criminal Appeals, by way of special leave, are filed
by the appellants against a common order dated 26th October, 2007
passed by the High Court of Bombay at Goa in Criminal Revision
Application Nos. 3, 10, 19, 21 and 22 of 2007, whereby the High
Court while setting aside the charges framed by the learned Special
Judge,  Panaji  against  the  accused—appellants  for  the  offences
punishable under Sections 120-B, 409, 420, 465 and 471, IPCand
directed to frame charges against them under Sections 13 (1)(d)(i)
and 13(1)(d)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 read with
Section 120-B, IPC.3
2.In a  nutshell,  the  genesis  of  the  dispute  in  all  these
appealspertains to a Notification dated 30thSeptember, 1991 issued
by the Government of Goa, duly approved by the Cabinet, according
to which those industrial units who apply for bona fide use of High
Tension  or  Low  Tension  power  supply  to  their  industrial  units
would be eligible for a rebate of 25% in their tariff for a period of five
years. The appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 315 of 2011 (Accused
No. 1) was the Minister of Power for the State of Goa during the
period  22-12-1994  to  29-07-1998  whereas  the  appellant  in
Criminal Appeal No. 313 of 2011 (Accused No. 2) was also a public
servant at that time being Chief Electrical Engineer.Accused Nos. 3
and 4 were Managing Director and Executive Director, respectively,
of the appellant Company in Criminal Appeal 314 of 2011 (Accused
No. 6), while the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 312 of 2011
(Accused No. 5) was the General Manager of appellant Company in
Criminal Appeal No. 311 of 2011 (Accused No. 7).
3.The Government of Goa, during the tenure of accused No.
1 as Minister of Power, with the consent of Cabinet, issued another
Notification  dated  31-03-1995  cancelling  the  earlier  Notification
dated 30-09-1991 without assigning any reason for its cancellation.
Afterwards, it is alleged that another Notification dated 15-5-19964
was issued, without approval of the Cabinet introducing another
category of ‘Extra High Tension’ power supply and after that one
more  Notification  dated  01-08-1996  was  issued,  again  without
Cabinet  approval,  restoring  the  benefit  of  25%  rebate,  at  the
instance of accused No. 1, only to benefit accused nos. 6 & 7
Companies.
4.Acting upon a complaint lodged by an M.L.A., the State
levelled allegations against the accused individuals that by entering
into a criminal conspiracy they provided wrongful gains to both the
appellant Companies (Accused Nos. 6 & 7) and favored the two
Companies for availing 25% rebate on power tariff by illegal means
and thereby caused huge loss of Rs.4,52,77,856/- to the exchequer
of Government of Goa.
5.Taking  note  of  the  allegations  levelled  against  the
accused, the Special Judge, Panaji by order dated 8thDecember,
2006  framed  charges  against  the  accused—appellants  for  the
offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 409, 420, 465, 468 and
471, IPC and also under Section 13(1)(d)(i) and 13(1)(d)(ii) read with
Section  13(2)  of  the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988.  The
aggrieved appellants approached the High Court by way of Criminal5
Revision  Applications. The  High  Court on  the  analysis of  facts,
arrived at the conclusion that the facts of the case do not disclose
an offence of cheating and there was no offence of criminal breach
of  trust.  Accordingly,  the  appellants  were  discharged  from  the
offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 409, 420, 465, 468 and
471, IPC. However, the High Court observed that there is sufficient
prima  facie  material  against  the  accused  for  framing  charges
against  them  under  Section  13(1)(d)(i)  and  13(1)(d)(ii)  read  with
Section  120-B,  IPC.  Feeling  aggrieved  thereby,  the  accused—
appellants are before us in these appeals.
6.We have heard Mr. M.L. Varma, learned Senior counsel
appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.315/2011, Ms.
Binu  Tamta,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellant  in
Criminal Appeal No.311 of 2011, Ms. Asha Gopalan Nair, learned
counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.313 of
2011 and alsothe learned counsel appearing for the State of Goa at
length.
7.Learned  senior  counsel  for  the  appellant  in  Criminal
Appeal No. 315 of 2011 relying upon this Court’s order in Civil
Appeal Nos. 3206-3217 of 1999, passed on 13th February, 20016
while dealing with the same Notifications, submitted that there is
no  need  to  continue  further  criminal  proceedings  against  the
appellants herein. The said order reads thus:
“The High Court by the impugned judgment has held that
the  circular  dated  31st  March,  1998  issued  by  the
Government of Goa suspending the release of rebate with
immediate effect as well as suspension of rebate agreed
to be governed in sixty monthly installments has no legal
efficacy and is, therefore, invalid. The High Court has
further held that the notification dated 24th July, 1998 is
legal and valid. Consequently the High Court directed
that the writ petitioners are entitled to 25% rebate in
power  tariff  till  26th  July,  1998.  This  has  been
challenged by means of the present appeals. Second set
of appeals have been filed by the writ petitioners against
the judgment of the High Court whereby and whereunder
the High Court has held that notification dated 27th July
1998 is valid.
We have heard counsel for the parties and perused the
record. The High Court has taken the aforesaid view after
taking into consideration overall facts and circumstances
and inasmuch as public interest which, according to us,
is very balanced view of the matter. We, therefore, are not
inclined to interfere with the matters Both the sets of
appeals fail and are accordingly dismissed. There shall be
no order as to costs”.
8.It is further argued before us that the High Court erred in
not taking into account the factum that the complaint against the
accused—appellants was filed by political opponent of the appellant
whohad foisted the charges which are mala fide, misconceived and7
concocted with a view to score political vendetta.Whereas power
rebate policy was existing in the State since 1991 and in 1993, out
of the High Tension category an Extra High Tension category was
carved  out  by  the  Government  for  the  purpose  of  providing
additional benefit to industrial consumers. Drawing our attention to
a judgment of this Court in MRF Limited  vs. Manohar Parrikar &
Others, (2010) 11 SCC 374, learned senior counsel submitted that
this Court has already considered the Notifications in question, in
an  earlier  round  of  litigation  and  expressed  the  view  that  the
decision taken by the appellant herein—accused No. 1 as a Minister
was balanced. 
9.Ms.  Binu  Tamta,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the
appellantsin Criminal Appeal Nos. 311 & 312 of 2011 submitted
that as a matter of fact, the complaint in question was already
closed on 2.2.1999, but to meet the political will of the complainant
when he came to power in the State, the complaint was reopened at
his  instance.  The  view  taken  by  the  Courts  below  in  framing
charges against the accused is entirely wrong inasmuch as the trial
Court  made  an  observation  that  the  circumstances  give  rise  to
suspicion that accused Nos. 1 to 5 conspired to extend benefit to
the  accused  Nos.  6  &  7  Companies.  Mere  suspicion  does  not8
warrant framing of charges against the appellants. learned counsel
wrongly placed reliance on a decision of this Court in  Hira Lal
Hari Lal Bhagwati  Vs.  CBI, New Delhi,  (2003) 5 SCC 257 and
submitted that by virtue of the Notifications in question, no benefit
was got by the appellant and whatever amount had to be paid, has
already  been  paid,  and  accordingly  the  charges  against  the
appellant should be dropped.
10.Learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal
Appeal  No.313  of  2011,  Ms.  Asha  G.  Nair,  submitted  that  the
appellant in his official capacity had only made submissions in
accordance  with  the  instructions  received  by  superiors  in  the
normal course of discharging his official duties. By any stretch of
imagination, the appellant cannot be equated as conspirator when
the deciding authorities were the Secretary and the Minister. She
has further submitted that the appellant has already retired from
his  service  and  virtually  he  has  no  role  to  play  in  the  alleged
conspiracy and the allegation that he is close to Minister does not
form a ground for levelling charges against him.
11.Learned  counsel  for  the  State  while  supporting  the
impugned judgment, submitted that there was enough material on9
record to establish that accused Nos. 1 & 2, being public servants
at the relevant time, had entered into a criminal conspiracy to
facilitate  wrongful  gains  to  accused  Nos.  6  &  7  Companies  in
collusion with their officials (accused Nos. 3 & 4). In pursuit of their
criminal conspiracy, they abused their positions and caused huge
loss to the public exchequer and benefited accused Companies by
illegal means. It is also vehemently argued that accused No. 1 while
abusing his official capacity prepared a false document giving an
appearance of genuine one and deceived the Government in taking
policy decision and enabled the accused Companies to avail 25%
rebate on power supply. He ultimately made a submission that
taking note of misdeeds of all the accused, the High court has in
clear terms expressed the opinion that there is sufficient prima facie
material to frame charges against all the accused, hence there is no
occasion for this Court to interfere and revisit the matter.
12.At  the  outset  it  would  be  pertinent  to  note  the  law
concerning the framing of charges and the standard which courts
must apply while framing charges. It is well settled that a court
while framing charges under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure  should  apply  the  prima facie standard.  Although  the
application of this standard depends on facts and circumstance in10
each case, a prima facie case against the accused is said to be made
out when the probative value of the evidence on all the essential
elements in the charge taken as a whole is such that it is sufficient
to induce the court to believe in the existence of the facts pertaining
to such essential elements or to consider its existence so probable
that a prudent man ought to act upon the supposition that those
facts existed or did happen. However, at this stage, there cannot be
a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the
evidence as if he was conducting a trial. [ Refer  Sajjan Kumar v.
CBI, (2010) 9 SCC 368;  State v. A. Arun Kumar , (2015) 2 SCC
417; State by the Inspector of Police, Chennai vs. S. Selvi and
Ors., (2018) 1 SCALE 5.]
13. Having thoughtfully considered the arguments advanced
by respective learned counsel and upon going through the record,
particularly the impugned judgment, in the light of sequence of
events, prima facie, it cannot be said that no case can be made out
against the accused—appellants. Allegedly, the Notifications dated
15-5-1996  and  1-8-1996  were  issued  without  the  approval  of
Cabinet and by violation of rules. Looking at the facts of the case in
a holistic manner, we do not think it necessary to go into the aspect
of thorough examination of merits of the case, particularly when the11
issue is still at the stage of framing of charges only. There is no
error in framing charges, as suggested by the High Court, when
presumably the material on record obligated the Court to do so. 
14.In  light  of  the  above  discussion,  we  do  not  see  any
illegality in the impugned order. Therefore, we find no reason to
interfere with the order passed by the High Court. However, learned
counsel appearing for the appellants, at this stage wants to place
before  the  trial  Court,  the  material,  judgments  and  the  earlier
passed order of this Court which are referred before us. We grant
liberty to the learned counsel to do so. 
15.With the above observations, the appeals are disposed of.

taken i.e. (i) Summary Case No.231 of 1996 (under Section 500 
of IPC) before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Nagpur; and (ii) 
Regular Criminal Case No.343 of 2003  (Old No.125 of 1998)  3 
 
(under Sections 468, 471, 218, 467, 420 and 34 of IPC) before 
the Court of Judicial  Magistrate First Class, Nagpur  have not 
been mentioned by the first respondent  despite knowledge of the 
same .  Consequently, according to the appellant – complainant, 
an infraction of the provisions of Section 125 -A has been 
committed fo r which the first respondent is liable to be 
prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction.   
 On the very same allegations the appellant had challenged 
the election of the first respondent before the High Court by 
instituting Election Petition No.1 of 2014 which has been 
dismissed by the High Court by its order dated 19th August, 
2015.  
5.  To determine the correctness of the stand taken by the 
appellant  - complainant and the legality  of the impugned order 
of the High Court holding that the complaint is  liable to be 
dismissed , the Court would be require d to consider the 
provisions of Section s 33-A and 125 -A of the 1951 Act, Rule 4A 
of the 1961 Rules read with Form -26 prescribed under the said 
Rules .  Several letters of the Election Commission of India to  the 4 
 
Chief Electoral Officers of all the States and the Union Territories 
issued in this regard would also require  a close look.  
 
6.  Before setting out the relevant provisions of the law 
enumerated above, a brief prologue on the judicial precedents 
that had led to the insertion of Sections 33 -A and 125 -A in the 
1951 Act  and the provisions of Rule 4 -A of the 1961 Rules  read 
with Form -26 is considered necessary.   
 
7.  In Union of India (UOI) and Ors.  v. Association for 
Democratic Reforms and Ors.1 this Court while examining the 
issue of the Voters right to know relevant particulars of the  
contesting candidates before they are called upon to cast their 
votes  had made the following observations :  
“22. For health of democracy and fair election, 
whether the disclosure of assets by a candidate, 
his/her qualification and particulars regarding 
involvement in criminal cases are necessary for 
informing voters, may be ill iterate, so that they can 
decide intelligently, whom to vote? In our opinion, 
the decision of even illiterate voter, if properly 
educated and informed about the contesting 
candidate, would be based on his own relevant 
 
1  (2002) 5 SCC 294  5 
 
criteria of selecting a candidate. In democracy, 
periodical elections are conducted for having 
efficient governance for the country and for the 
benefit of citizens -- voters. In a democratic form of 
government, voters are of utmost importance. They 
have right to elect or re -elect on the basis of the 
antecedents and past performance of the 
candidate. He has choice of deciding whether 
holding of educational qualification or holding of 
property is relevant for electing or re -electing a 
person to be his representative. Voter has to decide 
whether h e should cast vote in favour of a 
candidate who is involved in criminal case. For 
maintaining purity of elections and healthy 
democracy, voters are required to be educated and 
well informed about the contesting candidates. 
Such information would include as sets held by the 
candidate, his qualification including educational 
qualification and antecedents of his life including 
whether he was involved in a criminal case and if 
the case is decided --its result, if pending -- whether 
charge is framed or cognizance i s taken by the 
Court? There is no necessity of suppressing the 
relevant facts from the voters . 
[underlining is ours] ” 
 
Further, this Court issued the following directions to the Election 
Commission (para 48, pg. 322):  
“48. The Election Commission is direct ed to call 
for information on affidavit by issuing necessary 
order in exercise of its power under Article 324 of 
the Constitution of India from each candidate 
seeking election to Parliament or a State 
Legislature as a necessary part of his nomination 
paper , furnishing therein, information on the 6 
 
following aspects in relation to his/her 
candidature: - 
(1) Whether the candidate is convicted/acquitted/ 
discharged of any criminal offence in the past -if 
any, whether he is punished with imprisonment 
or fine?  
(2) Prior to six months of filing of nomination, 
whether the candidate is accused in any pending 
case, of any offence punishable with 
imprisonment for two years or more, and in which 
charge is framed or cognizance is taken by the 
Court of law. If so, the d etails thereof . 
[underlining is ours] ” 
 
8.  Consequent to the above and the directions issued in 
Association for Democratic Reforms  (Supra) , Section  33-A was 
inserted into the 1951 Act  vide the ‘Representation of the People 
(Third Amendment) Act, 2002’ (S ection 2 of the Act 72 of 2002).    
 
9.  The new Section 33 -A, which is the bone of contention 
in the present case, deals with the ‘Right to Information’  and 
reads as under:  
“33A. Right to information .—(1) A candidate 
shall, apart from any information which he is 
required to furnish,  under this Act or the rules 
made thereunder, in his nomination paper 
delivered under sub -section (1) of section 33, 
also furnish  the information as to whether – 
 7 
 
(i) he is accused of any offence punishable with 
imprisonment for two years or more in a pending 
case in  which a charge has been framed by the 
court of competent jurisdiction;  
 
(ii) he has been convicted of an offence other 
than any offence referred to in sub -section (1) or 
sub-section(2), or covered in sub-section (3), of 
section 8 and sentenced to imprisonment for one 
year or more.  
 
(2) The candidate or his proposer, as the case 
may be, shall, at the time of delivering to the 
returning officer the  nomination paper under 
sub-section (1) of section 33, al so deliver to him 
an affidavit sworn by the candidate in a 
prescribed  form verifying the information 
specified in sub -section (1).  
 
(3) The returning officer shall, as soon as may be 
after the furnishing of information to him under 
sub-section (1),display the aforesaid information 
by affixing a copy of the affidavit, delivered under 
sub-section (2), at a conspicuous place at  his 
office for the information of the electors relating 
to a constituency for which the nomination 
paper is delivered.  
[underlining is  ours] ” 
 
 
It is pertinent to note here that Section 33 -A(1), as worded  and 
drafted , required furnishing of the information of cases where (i) 
the person filing the nomination has been convicted; and (ii) 
where charges have been framed against the person filing the 
nomination but excluded cases where cognizance had been 8 
 
taken.   This was despite the order of this Court, notice d above , 
to the effec t that details of case(s) of which cognizance has been 
taken should also be furnished.  
 
10.  The aforesaid discrepancy was addressed by this 
Court, in the case of People's Union for civil Liberties (PUCL) 
and Ors . v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors .2  In the said case, this 
Court had examined the import of Sections 33 -A and 33 -B3 of the 
1951 Act [as inserted in the 1951 Act  through the amendment in 
2002 (Supra )] vis-à-vis the directions issued by this Court in the 
case of Association for Democratic Reforms  (Supra) and held 
as under  (opinion of M.B. Shah, J. is quoted.  The opinion of P. 
Venkatarama Reddi and D.M. Dharmadhikari, JJ. on the point 
is one of concurre nce): 
“114. I shall now discuss the specifics of the 
problem. With a view to promote the right to 
information, this Court gave certain directives 
 
2 (2003) 4 SCC 399  
3Section 33 -B was also added through the 2002 Amendment. It stated that 
notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment of any Court, or any instruction 
issued by the Election Commission, no candidate shall be liable to disclose 
information not required by the Act or rules made thereunder.  
Section 33 -B was declared  unconstitutional in People’s Union of Civil Liberties v. 
Union of India and Ors. ((2003) 4 SCC 399)  as violating the fundamental right of 
citizens to know the antecedents of candidates contesting in the elections, which 
right was held to be an essential facet of freedom of speech and  expression 
enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution which co uld only be validly 
limited through the restrictions conforming with Article. 19(2) of the Constitution 
of India.  9 
 
to the Election Commission which, as I have 
already clarified, were ad hoc in nature. The 
Election Commission was directe d to call for 
details from the contesting candidates broadly 
on three points, namely, ( i) criminal record, ( ii) 
assets and liabilities, and ( iii) educational 
qualification. The Third Amendment to the RP 
Act which was preceded by an ordinance 
provided for d isclosure of information. How far 
the Third Amendment to the Representation of 
the People Act, 2002 safeguards the right of 
information which is a part of the guaranteed 
right under Article 19(1)( a), is the question to be 
considered now with specific refer ence to each 
of the three points spelt out in the judgment of 
this Court in  Assn. for Democratic Reforms 
case.  
 
115. As regards the first aspect, namely, 
criminal record, the directives in  Assn. for 
Democratic Reforms case  are twofold: (SCC p. 
322, para 4 8) 
“(1) Whether the candidate is 
convicted/acquitted/discharged of any 
criminal offence in the past — if any, whether 
he is punished with imprisonment or fine.  
(2) Prior to six months of filing of 
nomination, whether the candidate is an 
accused in any pending case, of any offence 
punishable with imprisonment for two years 
or more, and in which charge is framed or 
cognizance is taken by the court of law .” 
As regards  the second directive, Parliament has 
substantially proceeded on the same lines and 
made it obligatory for the candidate to furnish 
information as to whether he is accused of any 
offence punishable with imprisonment for two 
years or more in a pending case in which a 10 
 
charge has been framed by the competent court. 
However, the case in which cognizance has been 
taken but charge has not been framed is not 
covered by clause ( i) of Section 33 -A(I). 
Parliament having taken the right step of 
compelling disclosure of the pendency of cases 
relating to major offences, there is no good 
reason why it failed to provide for the disclosure 
of the cases of the same nature of which 
cognizance has been taken by the Court. It is 
common knowledge that on account of a  variety 
of reasons such as the delaying tactics of one or 
the other accused and inadequacies of the 
prosecuting machinery, framing of formal 
charges gets delayed considerably, especially in 
serious cases where committal procedure has to 
be gone through. O n that account, the 
voter/citizen shall not be denied information 
regarding cognizance taken by the Court of an 
offence punishable with imprisonment for two 
years or more. The citizen's right to information, 
when once it is recognized to be part of the 
fundamental right under Article 19(1)( a), cannot 
be truncated in the manner in which it has been 
done. Clause ( i) of Section 33 -A(I) therefore falls 
short of the avowed goal to effectuate the right 
of information on a vital aspect. Cases in which 
cognizance h as been taken should therefore be 
comprehended within the area of information 
accessible to the voters/citizens, in addition to 
what is provided for in clause ( i) of Section 33 -
A. 
[underlining is ours] ” 
 
Further, the Court held : 
“123. Finally, the summary of my conclusions:  
(1) ….. 11 
 
 
(2) …. 
 
(3) The directives given by this Court in  Union of 
India  v. Assn. for Democratic Reforms  were 
intended to operate only till the law was made by 
the legislature and in that sense “pro tempore” in 
nature. Once legislation is made, the Court has to 
make an independent assessment in order to 
evaluate whether the items of information 
statutorily ordained are reasonably adequate to 
secure the right of information available to the 
voter/citizen. In embarking on this exercise, the 
points of disclosure indicated by this Court, even 
if they be tentative or ad hoc in nature, should be 
given due weight and substantial departure 
therefrom cannot be countenanced.  
 
… 
 
 (6) The right to information provided for by 
Parliament under Section 33 -A in regard to the 
pending criminal cases and past involvement in 
such cases is reasonably adequate to safeguard 
the right to information vested in the voter/citizen. 
However, there is no good reason for excluding the 
pending cases in which cognizance has been taken 
by the Court from the ambit of disclosure . 
[underlining is ours] ” 
 
 
Eventually, the following direction was issued by the Court 
to the Election Commission of India:  
“123 (9) The Election Commission has to issue 
revised instructions to ensure implementation 12 
 
of Section 33 -A subject to what is laid down in 
this judgment regarding the cases in which 
cognizance has been taken ….” 
 
 
11.  Section 125 -A of the 1951 Act [Inserted by Section 5 
of the Representation of the People (Third Amendment) Act, 2002’ 
(Act 72 of 2002) ] reads as under:  
 
“Section 125 -A. Penalty for filing false affidavit, 
etc.- A candidate who himself or through his 
propos er, with intent to be elected in an 
election, — 
(i) fails to furnish information relating to 
sub-section (1) of section 33 -A; or 
(ii) gives false information which he knows 
or has reason to believe to be false; or  
(iii) conceals any information,  
in his nomi nation paper delivered under sub -
section (1) of section 33 or in his affidavit which 
is required to be delivered under sub -section (2) 
of section 33 -A, as the case may be, shall, 
notwithstanding anything contained in any 
other law for the time being in for ce, be 
punishable with imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to six months, or with fine, or with 
both” 
 
12.  Whether the provisions of Section 125 -A of the 1951 
Act would be applicable  in the present case , as claimed by the 
appellant – complainant , to make the first respondent liable in 13 
 
law, would require the Court to decide on the true meaning and 
purport of the following phrases found in Section 125 -A of the 
1951 Act . 
(a) fails to furnish information relating  to sub -section (1) 
of Section 33-A;  
(b) conceals any information;  
(c) in his nomination paper delivered under sub -section 
(1) of section 33 or in his affidavit which is required to 
be delivered under s ub-section (2) of section 33 -A. 
 
13.  To find out the true meaning and purport of the 
aforesaid phrases, the crucial question that has to be answered 
is whether the word  ‘information’ as mentioned in Section 33 -A 
of the 1951 Act means only such information as mentioned in 
clause (i) and (ii) of Section 33 -A(1) or whether along with the said  
information a candidate is also required to furnish such other 
information as required under the Act or the Rules made 
thereunder. The consequential question that would arise is 
whether in the affidavit required to be filed under sub -section (2) 
of Sectio n 33-A information is to be given as required in terms of 14 
 
the affidavit which is prescribed by Form -26 of the 1961 Rules or 
such information is confined to what is required to be submitted 
under Section 33 -A (1) (i) and (ii).  It is at this stage that Rule  4-
A of the 1961 Rules would require to be noticed.  Rule 4 -A which 
was inserted by S.O.935(E), dated 3.9.2002 with effect from 
3.9.2002 is in the following terms.  
   
“4-A. Form of affidavit to be filed at the time 
of delivering nomination paper .— The 
candidate or his proposer, as the case may be, 
shall, at the time of delivering to the returning 
officer the nomination paper under sub -section 
(1) of Section 33 of the Act, also deliver to him 
an affidavit sworn by the candidate before a 
Magistrate of the  first class or a Notary in Form 
26.” 
 
14.  Form 26 is the prescribed form of affidavit to be filed 
by a candidate along with his nomination papers  as required 
under Section  33-A (2) of the 1951 Act.  The said affidavit in the 
prescribed form reads as hereunder:

DEPONENT  
Note: 1.  Affidavit should be filed latest by 3.00 PM on the last day of filing nominations.  
Note: 2. Affidavit should be sworn before an Oath Commissioner or Magistrate of the First Class or before 
a Notary Public.  
Note: 3. All column should be  filled up and no column to be left blank. If there is no information to 
furnish in respect of any item, either “Nil” or “Not applicable”, as the case may be, should be 
mentioned.  
Note: 4. The Affidavit should be either typed  or written legibly and neatly .” 
 
15.  It may be noticed here that Form -26 was substituted 
by S.O. 1732 (E) dated 1.8.2012 with effect from 1.8.2012 . 
 
16.  A bare perusal of Form -26 makes it abundantly clear 
that, for offences punishable with imprisonment for two years or 21 
 
more, while entry (5) (i) mandates disclosure of information by 
the contesting candidate regarding the case(s) that is/are 
pending against him in which charges have been framed by the 
Court;  entry (5)(ii) mandates disclosure of information by the 
contesting candidate regarding cases that are pending against 
him in which cognizance has been taken by the Court.  
Entry 5(ii) specifically mentions that the candidate is 
required to provide information of the case(s) pending in which 
cognizance has been taken .  This is in addition to the information 
he is required to provide against the column in Entry 5(i) as the 
words ‘Other than the cases mentioned in item (i) above’ are 
specifically used  in Entry 5 (ii) . 
 
17.  The above  can leave no element of doubt that, 
subsequent to the substitution of Form 26 in 2012, the new Form 
26 (as in vogue at the time of the elections in 2014),  mandates 
the disclosure of information by the contesting candidate of not 
only case(s) in which charges have been framed but also case(s) 
in which cognizance has been taken by the Court.  
 22 
 
 
18.  The position is made further clear by the letters 
written by t he Election Commission of India to the Chief Electoral 
Officer of all the States and the Union Territories.   A reading of 
the said letters would go to show that a contesting candidate is 
mandated to furnish information concerning the cases in which 
a Comp etent Court has taken cognizance along with the cases in 
which charges have been framed. The said letters also make it 
clear that the affidavit mentioned in Section 33 -A(2) of the 1951 
Act is prescribed in Form -26 and that any false declaration or 
concealm ent of information in the said affidavit will attract the 
provisions of Section 125 -A of the 1951 Act.  The letters in this 
regard are dated 24.8.2012, 26.9.2012 and 26.4.2014, relevant 
portions of which are extracted below:  
 
(i) Letter dt. 24-08-2012 :  
 
 “1. Sub: - Affidavit to be filed by candidates with 
their nomination paper -modification of format -
regarding.  
 
The candidates at elections to the Parliament 
and the State Legislatures hitherto were 
required to file two affidavits: one, in Form -26 
appended to Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 23 
 
and the other, in the Form prescribed by the 
Commission, vide its Order No. 3/ER/2003 dt. 
27-03-2003, as subsequently modified by the 
letter of even number dt. 25 -02-2011. In the 
affidavits, the candidates a re required to declare 
information about their criminal background, if 
any, assets, liabilities and educational 
qualifications.  
 
2. On a proposal moved by the Commission 
for amalgamating the two affidavits into one 
format, the Govt. has  amended Form 26 so as 
to include in it all the information that was 
sought in the two separate affidavits. The 
Ministry of Law and Justice have notified the 
revised format 26 in the Gazette of India on 01 -
08-2012. A copy of the said notification dated 
1st August, 2012 is enc losed herewith.  
 
3. In view of the amendment to Form -26, all 
candidates shall, hereafter, file only one 
affidavit in the revised Form 26 notified on 01 -
08-2012 (at elections to the Parliament and 
State Legislatures). The requirements to be 
followed while f iling the affidavit have been 
mentioned in the notes given at the end of the 
format…..  
 
... 
 
5. You are requested to furnish a copy of this 
letter along with the copy of the enclosed 
notification to every political party (including 
registered unrecognized parties) having 
headquarters in your State/UT, including the 
State Units of recognized National and State 
political parties.”[Emphasis is ours]. ” 
 
(ii). Letter dt. 26 -09-2012 :  24 
 
 
 “Sub: Affidavit to be filed by the candidates 
with their nomination paper -regarding:  
… 
 
2. Item 5 of Part A and Part B of the revised 
Form 26 relates to information regarding 
criminal antecedentsto be furnished by the 
candidates. It is clarified that in i tem (5)(ii) of 
the said Part A & Part B of Form -26, the details 
of all pending cases in which cognizance has 
been taken by the Court, irrespective of the 
quantum of punishment or framing of charges 
will have to be disclosed by the candidate . This 
may be br ought to the notice of all candidates 
when they file their nomination  at all future 
general/bye -elections in the State… ” 
 
 
(iii) Letter dt. 26 -04-2014:  
 
“Sub: Filing of false affidavit in Form -26.reg.  
 Sir/Madam,  
 
You are aware that the format of affidavit  in 
Form -26 appended to the Conduct of Election 
Rules, 1961, was amended with effect from 01 -
08-2012. Now the candidates are required to 
make declarations about assets and liabilities 
including that of spouse and dependants, 
candidate’s criminal antecedent s and 
educational qualifications, in the affidavit in 
Form 26. The concealing of information in the 
affidavit in Form 26 will attract the provisions of 
Section 125A. Under Section 125A, furnishing 
of any false information or concealing of 
information in th e affidavit in Form 26 is an 
electoral offence punishable with imprisonment 
upto six months, or with fine or both . 25 
 
 
2. Prior to amendment to Form 26 in August 
2012, the affidavit regarding declaration about 
assets, liabilities, criminal antecedents and 
educational qualification was given in the 
format prescribed by the Commission. In the 
case of complaints about false stat ement in the 
said affidavit, the Commission, vide its circular 
letter No. 3/ER/2004, dated 2/6/2004, had 
clarified that if complaints were filed before the 
Returning Officer raising the issue of false 
declaration in the affidavit and if the RO was 
prima fa cie satisfied about the merits of the 
complaint, then the RO was to file a complaint 
before the competent Court under Section 177 
of IPC read with Section 195 of Cr.P.C.  
 
3. Now that the affidavit is in Form 26 under 
Section 33A of the R.P. Act, 1951, making false 
declaration/concealing of information in the 
affidavit would be covered under Section 125A 
of the Act. Under Section 125A, there is no 
stipulation that complaints under the Section 
have to be made by the public servant 
concerned (in this case the R.O.). Therefore, it 
would be open to any aggrieved person to move  
petition before the appropriate Court of 
competent jurisdiction with petition for action 
under Section 125A in the case of any false 
declaration or concealing of information in the 
affidavit in Form 26.  
[underlining is ours] ” 
 
19.  A cumulative reading of Section 33 -A of the 1951 Act 
and Rule 4 -A of the 1961 Rules and Form -26 along with the 
letters dated 24.8.2012, 26.9.2012 and 26.4.2014, in our 26 
 
considered view, make it amply clear that  the information to be 
furnished u nder Section  33-A of the 1951 Act includes not only 
information mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii)  of Section 33 -A(1), 
but also information, that the candidate is required to furnish, 
under the Act or the Rules made thereun der and such 
information should be furnished in Form 26, which includes 
information concerning cases in which a competent Court has 
taken cognizance (Entry 5(ii) of Form 26) .  This is  apart from and 
in addition to cases in which charges have been framed for an 
offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more or 
cases in which conviction has been recorded and sentence of 
imprisonment for a period of one year or more has been imposed 
(Entries 5(i) and 6 of F orm 26 respectively) . 
 
20.  In the light of the view that we have taken  and in view 
of the clear averment made in the complaint to the effect that the 
First Respondent had knowledge of the two cases against him 
which had not been mentioned in the affidavit  filed by the First 
Respondent alongwith his nomination papers , we unhesitatingly 
arrive at the conclusion that the order of the learned trial Court 27 
 
upheld by the High Court by the impugned judgment and order 
dated 3rd May, 2018 is legally not tenable and the same deserves 
to be set aside which we hereby do.  The complaint of the 
appellant will be considered afresh by the learned trial Court 
from the stage where it was interdicted by the order dated 
30.5.2016.  
 
21.  Our view as above is in consonance with a similar view 
expressed by this Court in paragraph 75 of the report in 
Krishnamoorthy v. Sivakumar  and others4.   Para 75 of the 
report in Krishnamoorthy  (supra)  reads as under:  
“75. On a perusal of the aforesaid format, it is 
clear as crystal that the details of certain 
categories of the offences in respect of which 
cognizance has been taken or charges have 
been framed must be given/furnished. This 
Rule is in consonance with Section 33 -A of the 
1951 Act. Section 33(1) envisages that 
information has to b e given in accordance with 
the Rules. This is in addition to the information 
to be provided as per Sections 33(1)( i) and ( ii). 
The affidavit that is required to be filed by the 
candidate stipulates mentioning of cases 
pending against the candidate in which charges 
have been framed by the Court for the offences 
punishable with imprisonment for two years or 
more and also the case s which are pending 
 
4 (2015) 3 SCC 467  28 
 
against him in which cognizance has been taken 
by the court other than the cases which have 
been mentioned in clause (5)( i) of Form 26. 
Apart from the aforesaid, clause (6) of Form 26 
deals with conviction.  
 
 
22.  Consequently and in th e light of the above, the appeals 
are allowed.  The order of the High Court dated 3rd May, 2018 is 
set aside.  All pending applications including the application for 
intervention/impleadment are disposed of.

2.This  judgment  would  dispose  of  the  afore-captioned  appeals
which  relate  to  the  legal  effect  of  bifurcation  of  the  State  of
Madhya Pradesh into the successor State of Madhya Pradesh and
the State of Chhattisgarh by the Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation
Act, 2000 (“Reorganisation Act”, for short) on exemption or benefit
of deferment of sales tax granted under the Madhya Pradesh
Commercial Tax Act, 1994 read with the applicable rules. The
question  to  be  answered  is  whether  the  industrial  unit  in  the
reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh and under the new State of
Chhattisgarh would continue to avail the benefit of such exemption
or  deferment  even  after  the  bifurcation  in  both  the  states,
irrespective of the location of the industrial unit which would be in
one of the two states. 
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page 2 of 383.Civil Appeal Nos. 460, 461, 7073 of 2005 and 2343 of 2007 arise
from the judgments of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh
High Court, Jabalpur Bench, upholding judgment of the learned
Single  Judge  dismissing  the  Writ  Petition  by  the
manufacturer/dealer  of  cement  inter-alia recording  that  on
enforcement of the Reorganisation Act, two separate states viz.,
the State of Madhya Pradesh and the State of Chhattisgarh had
come into existence as postulated by the Constitution of India and
hence, benefit of the exemption or deferment of sales tax would
be restricted and confined to the boundaries/limits of the state in
which the unit was located and would not operate beyond the
limits of the state boundary. It was observed that any trade and
movement of goods between the two states henceforth would be
inter-state trade and not intra-state trade and the provisions of the
Reorganisation  Act  had  not  removed  and  eclipsed  this  legal
position but had a limited effect to treat the laws in operation in the
State of Madhya Pradesh as equally applicable to the State of
Chhattisgarh.
4.The other set of appeals arising from Special Leave Petition (Civil)
Nos.  10520  of  2013,  1334,  10165,  23297  of  2014,  6729  and
16550  of  2016  have  been  preferred  by  the  State  of  Madhya
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page 3 of 38Pradesh and the State of Chhattisgarh impugning decisions of the
High  Court  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  which  have  in  view  of  the
pronouncement of this Court in  Commissioner of Commercial
Taxes, Ranchi and Another v. Swarn Rekha Cokes and Coals
Pvt.  Ltd.  and  Others1 taken  a  contrary  view  and  held  that
notwithstanding  the  creation  of  the  two  states,  exemption  or
deferment of tax notifications issued before the bifurcation would
continue to apply in the new state and that for the purpose of
sales tax, the two states were deemed to be one because of the
legal  fiction  envisaged  vide  Sections  78  and  79  of  the
Reorganisation Act.
5.At this stage, it would be appropriate to mention that a Division
Bench of this Court  (Ashok Bhan  and V.S. Sirpurkar, JJ.) vide
order dated 12th September, 2007 had observed that certain facts
and provisions of law which were not taken note of in  Swarn
Rekha’s case (supra), had come to light and therefore they had
thought it appropriate to refer the appeals to a larger Bench for
consideration.
6.Before we deal with the rival contentions, it would be appropriate
to notice and take on record the undisputed position. State of
1 (2004) 6 SCC 689
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page 4 of 38Madhya Pradesh in exercise of powers conferred under Section
12  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  General  Sales  Tax  Act,  1958  and
Section 8(5) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for convenience
we would refer to the two  enactments as the “Sales Tax Act” for
short),  with  a  view  to  attract  investors  and  increase  industrial
output in the State, had vide notification dated 19th February, 1991
formulated a policy for grant of sales tax exemption to industrial
units  having  fixed  assets  above  Rs.  100  crores.  Quantum  of
exemption from tax was to be equal to the capital investment in
the fixed assets and the duration or period was 11 years from the
date of commencement of commercial production or the date on
which quantum of exempted tax reached the limit equivalent to the
value of capital investment in the fixed assets. It is an undisputed
position that private parties/assessee to the present appeals being
entitled  to  the  benefit/exemption  were  issued  a  certificate  of
eligibility for exemption from tax by the Directorate of Industries in
the unified State of Madhya Pradesh.
7.The  industrial  units  belonging  to  the  private  parties/assessee
situated  in  the  unified  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  after  the
bifurcation in terms of the Reorganisation Act would necessarily
fall in the area/boundary forming a part either of the reorganised
State of Madhya Pradesh or the new State of Chhattisgarh. As
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page 5 of 38noticed  above,  the  precise  issue  before  us  is  whether  these
industrial units, which were granted exemption and were after the
bifurcation located in the reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh or
the new State of Chhattisgarh, would continue to enjoy the benefit
of exemption/deferment of tax in the other state while conducting
inter-state transaction(s) from the state they are located to the
new State of Chhattisgarh or the reorganised State of Madhya
Pradesh, as the case may be.
8.Before we dwell into the respective contentions and elaborate our
reasons, it would be appropriate to reproduce relevant provisions
of  the  Reorganisation  Act,  viz.  Sections  2(e),  (f),  (j)  and  (k),
Sections 3, 4 and 5 and Sections 78, 79, 80, 85 and 86(1) which
are as under:

9.The  Reorganisation  Act,  which  was  to  commence  from  the
appointed  day,  was  notified  by  the  Central  Government  vide
Notification  No.  S.O.  827(E),  dated  14th September,  2000
published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary Part II sec.3(ii)
with 1st November, 2000 as the appointed date. Accordingly, on 1st
November,  2000  the  erstwhile  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  was
bifurcated  and  divided  into  the  reorganised  State  of  Madhya
Pradesh and the new State of Chhattisgarh. The political map of
the  country  underwent  a  change.  The  reorganised  State  of
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page 9 of 38Madhya  Pradesh  and  the  new  State  of  Chhattisgarh  were
described as “successor State” vide clause (j) to Section 2 of the
Reorganisation Act. The transferred territories, which were to form
part of the State of Chhattisgarh, were demarcated and specified
in Section 3 of the Reorganisation Act. As per Section 4, the
reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh was to comprise of the
existing territories other than those specified in Section 3 i.e., the
territories which shall now form part of the State of Chhattisgarh.
The expression “law” as defined in clause (f) to Section 2 of the
Reorganisation Act included any enactment, ordinance, regulation,
order, notification, etc., in force immediately before the appointed
day in the whole or any part of the erstwhile or unified State of
Madhya Pradesh. The law by definition would include delegated
legislation and also the exemption notification issued under the
Sales Tax Act, and the certificate of eligibility for exemption from
tax issued under the Sales Tax Act.
10.Section 5 of the Reorganisation Act states that on and from the
appointed day, in the First Schedule to the Constitution under the
heading “THE STATES” after entry 25, entry 26 shall be inserted
by mentioning the State of Chhattisgarh which shall comprise of
the territories specified in Section 3 of the Reorganisation Act.
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  10 of
38Similarly,  in  relation  to  and  in  the  case  of  Madhya  Pradesh,
necessary changes will be made in the territories forming part of
the State by excluding the territories specified in Section 3 of the
Reorganisation Act.
11.Before interpreting Sections 78 and 79 of the Reorganisation Act
which are in  pari materia  to Sections 84 and 85 of the Bihar
Reorganisation Act, 2000, we would like to reproduce paragraphs
26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 of  Swarn Rekha  (supra), which read as
under:
“26. The question then arises, as to what is the true
meaning and import of Sections 84 and 85 of the Act?
27. We have earlier reproduced Sections 84 and 85 of
the Act. As earlier noticed, Sections 3 to 6 which form
part of Part II of the Act provide for the formation of
new States to be known as the State of Jharkhand and
the State of Bihar. The territories specified in Section 3
constitute  the  new  State  of  Jharkhand  and  the
remaining territories fall within the territory of the State
of  Bihar.  However,  Section  84  in  express  terms,
provides  that  the  provisions  of  Part  II  shall  not  be
deemed to have effected any change in the territories
to  which  any  law  in  force  immediately  before  the
appointed day extended or applied and the territorial
references in any such law to the State of Bihar shall,
until otherwise provided by a competent legislature or
other competent authority, be construed as meaning
the territories within the existing State of Bihar before
the appointed  day.  Section  85 provides that  for the
purpose of facilitating the application in relation to the
State of Bihar or Jharkhand of any law made before the
appointed  day,  the  appropriate  Government  may,
before the expiration of two years from that day, by
order, make such adaptations and modifications of the
law, whether by way of repeal or amendment, as may
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  11 of
38be necessary or expedient, and thereupon every such
law shall have effect subject to the adaptations and
modifications  so  made  until  altered,  repealed  or
amended  by  a  competent  legislature  or  other
competent authority. The language in these sections is
clear and unambiguous. These sections provide that
the laws which were applicable to the undivided State
of Bihar would continue to apply to the new  States
created by the Act. The laws that operated continue to
operate notwithstanding the bifurcation of the erstwhile
State  of  Bihar  and  creation  of  the  new  State  of
Jharkhand.  They  continue  in  force  until  and  unless
altered, repealed or amended. It is not disputed before
us and indeed it cannot be disputed in view of the wide
definition given to “law” in Section 2( f) of the Act that
the  notification  issued  under  Section  7(3)( b)  of  the
Bihar Finance Act, 1981 is law within the meaning of
Sections 84 and 85 of the Act. Thus, the notification
published in the Bihar Gazette on 22-12-1995 bearing
SO  No.  478  continues  to  operate  in  the  State  of
Jharkhand till such time as it is altered, repealed or
amended.  By  virtue  of  Section  84,  the  territorial
references  in  any  such  law  (which  includes  the
notification in question), to the State of Bihar shall be
construed as meaning the territories within the existing
State of Bihar before the appointed day, until otherwise
provided by a competent legislature or other competent
authority. A conjoint reading of both these provisions
makes it abundantly clear that the territorial references
in any law in force immediately before the appointed
day must be construed as meaning the territories within
the existing State of Bihar before the appointed day. To
facilitate  their  application  in  respect  of  the  State  of
Bihar or Jharkhand, the appropriate Government may,
before the expiration of two years from that day, by
order, make such adaptations and modifications of the
law as it may consider necessary or expedient by way
of repeal or amendment. Till such law is so repealed or
amended in accordance with law, it shall have effect.
After their amendment or alteration, they shall have
effect  subject  to  the  adaptations  and  modifications
made. We, therefore, find no difficulty in holding that
the  notification  of  the  Government  of  Bihar  issued
under Section 7(3)( b) of the Bihar Finance Act, 1981
and published in the gazette on 22-12-1995 being SO
No. 478 is law as defined by Section 2( f) of the Act.
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  12 of
38The said notification holds the field and applies to all
the territories which comprised the undivided State of
Bihar. The States of Bihar and Jharkhand have been
vested  with  power  to  make  such  adaptations  and
modifications  of  the  law  as  they  may  consider
necessary or expedient. This they can do by issuance
of order before the expiration of two years from the
appointed day. After the adaptations and modifications
of the law, the law shall have effect as so modified or
adapted till such time as a competent legislature or
other  competent  authority  further  alters,  repeals  or
amends such law.
28.  This is not the first time that a provision such as
Section 84 of the Act has come up for interpretation by
this Court. Section 88 of the Punjab Reorganisation
Act, 1966 is also identically worded as Section 84 of
the  Act.  That  provision  came  up  for  consideration
before this Court in at least three decisions which have
been brought to our notice, namely, State of Punjab  v.
Balbir  Singh,  Sher  Singh v.  Financial  Commr.  of
Planning and Dhayanand v. Union of India. In the first
of these cases i.e. in  State of Punjab  v.  Balbir Singh
this Court was concerned with an administrative order
and not a law  with which we are concerned in the
instant case. Section 88 of the Punjab Reorganisation
Act was noticed as also the definition of law under
Section 2(g) of that Act. Section 2( g) of that Act did not
define  law  as  widely  as  it  has  been  defined  under
Section 2(f) of the Act. This Court agreed with the High
Court  that  the  impugned  administrative  orders  in
question were not law within the meaning of Section
2(g) of that Act and hence, were not saved by Section
88. However, this Court held that when there is no
change of sovereignty and it is merely an adjustment of
territories by reorganisation of a particular State, the
administrative orders made by the Government of the
erstwhile State continue to be in force and effective
and binding on the successor States until and unless
they  are  modified,  changed  or  repudiated  by  the
Governments  of  the  successor  States.  This  Court
observed that no other view is possible to be taken as
that will merely bring about chaos in the administration
of the new States. Their Lordships found no principle in
support of the stand that administrative orders made by
the Government of the erstwhile State automatically
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  13 of
38lapsed and were rendered ineffective on the coming
into  existence  of  the  new  successor  States.  Their
Lordships further distinguished a case where there was
no change of sovereignty and there was merely an
adjustment  of  territories  by  the  reorganisation  of  a
particular State, from a case of absorption of one State
in  another  by  accession,  conquest,  merger  or
integration. The same view was taken by this Court in
the other two judgments referred to earlier. We are of
the view that the principles laid down in  Balbir Singh
case fully apply to the facts of this case having regard
to the identical legislative provision and, particularly so
when the notification in question is by definition law
and not a mere administrative order.
29.  The  next  question  which  arises  is  whether  the
aforesaid notification has been altered or modified by
the State of Jharkhand. It was sought to be argued
before us that the State of Jharkhand has announced
its own industrial policy on 25-8-2001 and, therefore,
the industrial policy of 1995 and the notification bearing
SO No. 478 dated 22-12-1995 issued under Section
7(3)(b) of the Act will have no legal force in the State of
Jharkhand. The High Court in Swarn Rekha case  has
considered  this  aspect  of  the  matter  and  we  find
ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken
by the High Court. There is nothing in the industrial
policy of 2001 which alters, amends or repudiates the
notification  dated  22-12-1995.  It  deals  with  new
industrial units set up after 15-11-2000 and, therefore,
whatever benefits or incentives are provided for in the
said policy are applicable to new industrial units set up
after  15-11-2000.  In  the  instant  case,  we  are
concerned with industrial  units set up before 15-11-
2000  and  which  were  found  eligible  for  grant  of
exemption certificate under the industrial policy of the
State of Bihar of the year 1995. Moreover, the industrial
policy of the State of Jharkhand will not apply to the
units  already  existing  before  that  date.  In  these
circumstances  in  the  absence  of  anything  in  the
Industrial Policy, 2001 of the Government of Jharkhand
or in the notification or order issued by the Government
of Jharkhand, Notification No. SO No. 478 dated 22-
12-1995  must  continue  to  operate  in  the  State  of
Jharkhand  and  the  appellants  or  respondents
concerned, as the case may be, must be held entitled
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  14 of
38to the benefits and incentives envisaged by the said
notification. 
The submission which found favour with the High
Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Civil Appeal No. 3765
of 2003 is that the statutory notification issued by the
erstwhile State of Bihar envisaged only intra-State sale
transactions and not inter-State sale transactions. With
the coming into existence of two States, incentive by
way of exemption from payment of sales tax cannot be
claimed in respect of transactions which can now be
categorised  as  inter-State  sale  transactions.  The
submission  overlooks  the  provisions  of  Sections  84
and 85 of the Act, which create a legal fiction. It is well
settled that in interpreting a provision creating a legal
fiction, the court must ascertain the purpose for which
the fiction is created and having done so, to assume all
those facts and consequences which are incidental or
inevitable corollaries to the giving effect to the fiction.
When the law requires that an imaginary state of affairs
should be treated as real, then unless prohibited from
doing  so,  one  must  also  imagine  as  real  the
consequences and incidents which, if the putative state
of  affairs  had  in  fact  existed,  must  inevitably  have
flowed from or accompanied it. As Lord Asquith in East
End Dwellings Co. Ltd.  v.  Finsbury Borough Council,
All ER at p. 589 observed that having done so, you
must not cause or permit your imagination to boggle
when it comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state
of affairs. Section 84 bids us to imagine that despite
the division of the erstwhile State of Bihar into two
States,  any  law  in  force  immediately  before  the
appointed day, notwithstanding territorial references in
them, shall, until otherwise provided by the competent
legislature or other competent authority, be construed
as meaning the territories within the existing State of
Bihar  before  the  appointed  day.  In  simple  words,
though the law may refer to the State of Bihar, and
though the State of Bihar has been bifurcated into two
by creating the State of Jharkhand, the laws in force
before the appointed day must continue to operate in
the territories which formed the erstwhile State of Bihar.
This, of course, is subject to amendment, alteration or
repudiation  by  a  legislature  or  other  competent
authority.  The  statutory  notification  relied  upon,
therefore,  continues  to  operate  throughout  the
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  15 of
38territories which earlier constituted the State of Bihar.
Under Section 85, they shall continue to operate until
repealed or amended in the manner provided. As a
natural consequence, the entrepreneurs are entitled to
the  benefits  and  incentives  provided  in  the  said
notification. Having regard to the overriding provisions
of  this  Act,  as  envisaged  under  Section  91,  the
statutory  notifications  must  prevail  and  the  benefits
flowing therefrom must accrue to the beneficiaries. We
must not permit our mind to boggle by imagining that
what was one State earlier has now become two and
consequently what were intra-State sale transactions
earlier are now inter-State sale transactions. If any law
in force before the appointed day must have effect in
the absence of its modification or repeal, the benefit
under that law must flow notwithstanding the fact that
in  reality  intra-State  sale  transactions  may  have
become  inter-State  sale  transactions.  Law  gives
authority  to  the  State  concerned  to  bring  about  a
change  in  the  state  of  affairs,  if  it  so  considers
necessary or expedient by modifying or amending the
law  or  by  altering,  repealing  or  amending  it  by
legislation. We have, therefore, no doubt that the High
Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi was wrong in dismissing
the writ petition on the ground that the notification of
22-12-1995  could  not  apply  to  inter-State  sale
transactions.
30. We have carefully considered the decisions relied
upon by Shri Rakesh Dwivedi in  Rattan Lal & Co. v.
Assessing Authority, State of Mysore v. P.B. Hussain
Kunhi & Co. and CST v. Minerva Minerals  and we find
that none of those decisions in any manner advances
the case of the State. The decisions in those cases
depended on the interpretation of the provisions of the
Acts concerned which were not at all similar to the
provisions with which we are concerned in the instant
appeals. In Civil Appeal No. 2450 of 2003, the High
Court of Patna on a similar ground has rejected the
claim of the appellants. It noticed the earlier decision of
the  High  Court,  but  distinguished  the  same  on  the
ground that in the case in hand, the industrial unit was
situated in the State of Jharkhand while the benefit was
being  claimed  in  the  State  of  Bihar.  In  view  of our
earlier  findings,  this  would  not  be  a  relevant
consideration for rejecting the writ petition. Moreover, if
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  16 of
38this  principle  were  to  be  upheld,  it  would  result  in
arbitrary results inasmuch as the entrepreneurs whose
industrial units operate in the State of Bihar will get the
benefit  of  exemption  from  payment  of  sales  tax  on
purchase of raw materials in the State of Jharkhand,
but their counterparts in the State of Jharkhand would
not be entitled to such benefit. We must not lose sight
of the fact that an unforeseen event may give rise to
unusual  situations.  Faced  with  such  situations,  the
legislature  has  to  find  appropriate  methods  and
solutions to deal with them. When the State of Bihar
announced its industrial policy in the year 1995, it could
not foresee that the State will be divided five years
later.  But  when  the  division  of  the  State  became  a
reality, Parliament had to make appropriate provisions
to carry on the administration in the two States. If the
laws in force were to lapse on the day the division was
effected,  a  chaotic  situation  would  have  emerged
inasmuch  as  the  newly  created  State  would  be
rendered  a  State  without  laws.  It  is,  therefore,  that
provisions  like  Sections  84  and  85  of  the  Act  are
enacted to maintain continuity, and at the same time
authorise the States to make such modifications and
adaptations  as  are  considered  necessary  by  mere
issuance of orders within two years, and thereafter by
legislation  or  exercise  of  power  by  the  competent
authority.  Such  provisions  have  necessarily  to  be
incorporated in legislations relating to reorganisation of
States.  It  is,  therefore,  appropriate  that  such
legislations  must  be  construed  in  the  light  of  the
unusual  situation  created  by  the  creation  of  a  new
State and the object sought to be achieved.”
12.Relying upon the aforesaid ratio and interpretation of Sections 78
to 80, 85 and 86 of the Reorganisation Act, learned counsel for the
private parties/assessee have submitted that the Reorganisation
Act did not withdraw and negate the benefit of exemption which
was already granted in respect of the entire area forming part of
unified State of Madhya Pradesh. Provisions of the Reorganisation
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  17 of
38Act protect and enforce the “law” which included the exemption
notification in force in the unified State of Madhya Pradesh on the
appointed day. Reliance was placed on the Adaptation of Laws
Order,  2000  Notification  No.  F1/17/-2000/C.Tax/V  dated  30th
November, 2002 with effect from 1st November, 2000, the relevant
portion of which reads as under:
“2. The laws, as amended from time to time, specified
in the Schedule to this order, which are in force in the
State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  immediately  before  the
formation  of  the  State  of  Chhattisgarh,  are  hereby
extended  to  and  shall  be  in  force  in  the  State  of
Chhattisgarh until repealed or amended.  Subject to the
modifications that in all the laws for the words “Madhya
Pradesh” wherever they occur the word “Chhattisgarh”
shall be substituted.  
3. Anything done or any action taken (including any
appointment,  notification,  notice,  order,  rule,  form,
regulation,  certificate  or  licence)  in  exercise  of  the
powers conferred by order under the laws specified in
the Schedule shall continue to be in force in the State
of Chhattisgarh.”  
The Schedule to the said Notification, it was highlighted,
included  the  Sales  Tax  Act  and  the  rules  framed  thereunder.
Accordingly, the Adaptation of Laws Order states that subject to
the modification in the form of substitution of the word “Madhya
Pradesh” with the word “Chhattisgarh”, “the law” would continue to
apply and had remained in force and would be effective for the
balance period of 11 years or till the quantum of exemption was
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  18 of
38reached. Further, Section 80 of the Reorganisation Act empowers
the court, tribunal or authority to enforce “the law” for the purpose
of facilitating its application to the reorganised State of Madhya
Pradesh and the new State of Chhattisgarh in a manner, without
affecting its substance, as would be necessary or proper in regard
to the matter before the court, tribunal or authority. This prime
objective must keep in mind by the Court while interpreting the
provisions.  Section  85  in  the  nature  of  a  non-obstante or
overriding clause mandates that the provisions of the Act would
have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any
other  law.  Therefore,  the  exemption  notification  must  be
interpreted as in force in both the States i.e. the reorganised State
of Madhya Pradesh and the new State of Chhattisgarh as if the
unified State of Madhya Pradesh had not been bifurcated. This
would be the only way to reconcile Part X of the Reorganisation
Act and give effect to the legal fiction created by Sections 78 and
79  of  the  Reorganisation  Act.  Section  78  by  incorporating  a
deeming  fiction  enures  to  the  benefit  given  to  the  private
parties/assessee was not denied and fully given effect to. 
13.The two States, on the other hand, submit that with effect from the
appointed  day  the  new  State  of  Chhattisgarh  had  come  into
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  19 of
38existence and hence the trade inter-se or between the territories
now forming part of the State of Chhattisgarh and the reorganised
State of Madhya Pradesh would be in the nature of inter-state
sales  and  not  intra-state  sales.  The  Sales  Tax  Act  as  earlier
applicable  to  the  unified  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  would  be
applicable in the reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh and the
new State of Chhattisgarh but within the territorial confines and
limits of the two States. Therefore, the units situated within the
territorial limits/boundaries of the reorganised State of Madhya
Pradesh and the new State of Chhattisgarh would continue to
enjoy benefit of exemption in respect of intra-state trade within the
particular state and not in respect of inter-state trade between the
two states. This is the exact purport and meaning behind Section
78 and 79 of the Reorganisation Act.  Reliance was placed on the
judgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court
in  Sri Peera Mohammad Mahamood Saheb v. The State of
Andhra Pradesh2, which we would advert to at the appropriate
stage.
14.Having considered the contention of the parties and in the context
of Sections 78, 79, 80, 85 and 86 of the Reorganisation Act, we
feel that the stand taken by the State of Madhya Pradesh and the
2  1960 (11) STC 456 
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  20 of
38State of Chhattisgarh is correct and merits acceptance. We have
already reproduced the aforesaid provisions and partly interpreted
them in paragraphs 9 and 10 and would now proceed to interpret
Sections 78 and 79 of the Reorganisation Act. Section 78 of the
Reorganisation Act consist of two parts. The first part states that
the provisions of the Reorganisation Act shall not be deemed to
have affected any change in the territories to which any law in
force immediately before the appointed date extends or applies. In
other words, the law in force before the appointed date, which in
the present case is 1st November, 2000, would continue to apply to
the  successor  or  reorganised  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  as  it
existed before bifurcation. This is natural and normal as the laws
enacted  by  the  legislature  and  the  executive  of  the  State  of
Madhya Pradesh would obviously apply to the territories forming
part of it after its reorganisation/division. As a result of bifurcation
some areas that were earlier part of the State of Madhya Pradesh
would now form part of the new State of Chhattisgarh, albeit this
would not matter and affect application of the laws as they applied
prior to the appointed date to the territories that required a part of
the reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh. Section 78, no doubt
uses  the  word  ‘deemed’  but  in  fact,  the  first  part  does  not
incorporate/create any deeming fiction and rather postulates and
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  21 of
38states  the  obvious.  However,  the  second  part  of  Section  78
incorporates  a  deeming  fiction  when  it  states  that  territorial
references to such law in the State of Madhya Pradesh, i.e. the
laws  enacted by  the  legislature  and  executive  of  the  State of
Madhya Pradesh before bifurcation, shall until otherwise provided
by  the  competent  legislature  or  other  competent  authority  be
construed as meaning the territories within the existing state of
Madhya Pradesh before the appointed day. The effect, thereof, is
that the laws enacted by the State of Madhya Pradesh before the
reorganisation would continue to apply to the areas forming part of
the new State of Chhattisgarh and also the reorganised State of
Madhya  Pradesh,  but  within  their  territorial  confines.  The
enactments or the laws in force in the unified State of Madhya
Pradesh would continue to apply to the two states, not as one or
the same enactment or law, but as two separate enactments or
laws as applicable to two different states. 
15.The deeming fiction incorporated for the purpose of second
part of Section 78 does not postulate and state that the territories
which were earlier part of the State of Madhya Pradesh but now
form part of the State of Chhattisgarh would continue to remain
part of the reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh or should be
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  22 of
38treated as part and parcel of the other state. This is not what is
postulated in Section 78. Deeming fiction in terms of Section 78
does not extend and include any such stipulation, either expressly
or by necessary implication. Indeed, this is not even remotely
visualised. This Court in B. S. Goraya vs. U.T. of Chandigarh3, in
paragraphs  6  to  8  had  observed  that  a  deeming  provision  is
operative for the purposes for which it is created and the Court
should be careful not to extend this fiction beyond the legitimate
field and the purposes for which the legislature had adopted the
fiction. The purpose and objective for creating fiction must be kept
in mind. In the present enactment, the object and purpose of the
deeming provision envisaged in Section 78 of the Reorganisation
Act is limited and restricted to the enforcement of enactment/laws
as they existed in the unified State of Madhya Pradesh to the new
State of Chhattisgarh, and nothing more and beyond.
16.Section 79 of the Reorganisation Act states that the appropriate
Government of the reorganised State of Madhya Pradesh and the
new State of Chhattisgarh may, before the expiration of two years
from the appointed date, by an order, as may be necessary or
expedient, make such adaptations or modifications in the earlier
laws enacted in the unified State of Madhya Pradesh by way of
3 (2007) 6 SCC 397
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  23 of
38repeal  or  amendment.  Thereupon,  every  law  shall  have  effect
subject  to  the  adaptations  or  modifications  made,  until  further
repealed, modified or amended by the competent legislature or
other competent authority. Explanation to the said section states
that ‘appropriate Government’ in respect of any law means the
Central  Government  in  respect  of  matters  enumerated  in  the
Union List and in respect of any law in its application to a state,
the State Government.
17.Section 80 relates to the construction or interpretation of the laws
made by the State of Madhya Pradesh before the appointed date.
It  states  that  notwithstanding  that  no  provision  or  insufficient
provision has been made in terms of Section 79, the court, tribunal
or authority interpreting such laws made by the unified State of
Madhya Pradesh would construe the law in such a manner as to
facilitate  its  application  to  the  successor  States  of  Madhya
Pradesh  and  Chhattisgarh  without  effecting  the  substance.  In
other words, the court, tribunal or authority while interpreting the
laws  would  go  by  the  substance  and  with  the  objective  and
purpose of facilitating the application of laws in relation to the
successor  States  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Chhattisgarh,
notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  legislature  or  the  competent
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  24 of
38authority in relation to the laws applicable to the States of Madhya
Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have not passed any law before or
within the expiration period of two years from the appointed date. 
18.Section 85 of the Reorganisation Act states that the provisions of
the  said  enactment  shall  have  effect  notwithstanding  anything
inconsistent contained in any other law. Therefore, the provisions
of the Reorganisation Act have been given primacy over any other
law. However, this primacy is not meant to denude and over-ride
the legal effect envisaged by the Constitution consequent to the
creation of the successor State of Madhya Pradesh and the State
of  Chhattisgarh  which  would  henceforth  have  separate
government(s) comprising of different legislature and executive.
On and from the appointed date of 1st November,2000 any trade
between  the  State  of  Chhattisgarh  and  the  State  of  Madhya
Pradesh and vice-versa would be inter-state trade and not intra-
state  trade.  The  deeming  fiction  and  the  provisions  of  the
Reorganisation  Act  nowhere  postulate  that  the  trade  would
continue  to  remain  intra-state  trade  and  not  inter-state  trade
between the two States. In fact, any deeming fiction to the said
effect would have fallen afoul and would be contrary to Article 286,
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  25 of
38as it stood before amendment on 16th September, 2016 and reads
as under:
“286.  Restrictions as to imposition of tax on the
sale or purchase of goods: - 
No  law  of  a  State  shall  impose,  or  authorise  the
imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of goods
where such sale or purchase takes place
(a) outside the State; or
(b) in the course of the import of the goods into, or
export of the goods out of, the territory of India.
(2) Parliament  may  by  law  formulate  principles  for
determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes
place in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1).
(3) Any law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes, or
authorises the imposition of,
(a) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods declared by
Parliament by law to be of special importance in inter-
State trade or commerce; or
(b) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods, being a tax
of the nature referred to in sub-clause (b), sub-clause
(c) or sub-clause (d) of clause (29-A) of Article 366, 
be subject to such restrictions and conditions in regard
to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the
tax as Parliament may by law specify.”
As per the said Article, states are not competent to enact
any legislation relating to the taxation of ‘inter-state sales’, an
expression which, in the context of the Constitution, has been
subject  matter  of  several  decisions  explaining  the  difference
between ‘intra-state’ and ‘inter-state’ sales. The expression ‘inter-
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  26 of
38state’ trade has specific legal connotation and meaning. It refers to
transfer or movement of goods from one state to another. Such
transactions,  notwithstanding  that  the  situs  of  sale  would
necessarily be at a fixed location, are inter-state sale or trade and
not intra-state sale or trade. Thus, when there is a movement of
goods between the two states without there being a transfer of title
to the consignor or consignee, compliance would have to be made
with the relevant laws applicable to such inter-state transactions.
This position will hold good and equally apply in respect of the
inter-state sales between the new State of Chhattisgarh and the
reorganised  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  vice-versa.  The
movement of goods from one state to another is in the nature of
inter-state sales. The fact that two separate states are formed
after  the  bifurcation,  which  were  once  a  single  entity  for  the
purpose of levying sales tax, would be of no consequence so as to
disturb the legal and constitutional impact by which two separate
States were created and the legal effect of Article 286 as regards
the inter-state character of inter-state transactions. 
19.Section  86  of  the  Reorganisation  Act  states  that  in  case  any
difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of the said Act, the
President may, by an order, do anything as may be necessary and
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  27 of
38expedient  for  removing  the  difficulties.  However,  such  order
cannot be inconsistent with the provisions of the Reorganisation
Act. Proviso states that no order shall be made after the expiry of
three years from the appointed date. 
20.In Ranjan Sinha and Another v.  Ajay Kumar Vishwakarma and
Others4, three Judges’ Bench of this Court have elucidated that
the Parliament, under Article 3 of the Constitution, is empowered
to form a new State by separation of territory from any State or by
uniting two or more States. Article 4 of the Constitution states that
the law made by the Parliament with reference to Article 3 may
contain  supplemental,  consequential  and  incidental  provisions.
When  the  territory  of  the  existing  State  is  reorganised  by  the
Parliament under Article 3, there is no change of sovereignty and it
is only a case of adjustment of territories as some portion of the
territories forming part of the existing state would now form part of
the newly formed state or get merged in a new state. In the latter
case,  the  laws  which  were  applicable  to  the  territories  of  the
reorganised state would continue to apply to the territories of the
new state until the newly created state adapts or subject to its
4 (2017) 14 SCC 774
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  28 of
38competency amends or repeals the existing and applicable laws.
It was held:
“36.  At the cost of repetition, we may mention that
under Article 3 of the Constitution, Parliament can alter,
amend,  amalgamate,  form  new  States,  diminish  or
increase area of a State. The principle of “clean slate”
as applicable in international law is not applicable when
reorganisation  takes  place  under  Article  3  of  the
Constitution.  The reorganised States do not usually
start as  tabula rasa, rather they are successors of a
pre-existing erstwhile States.  Under BROA, Jharkhand
was carved out of Bihar and the other separate States
came into existence on 15-11-2000.  If the laws in force
were to lapse on the date the division was effected, a
chaotic situation would have emerged inasmuch as the
newly created State would be rendered a State without
laws. To avoid such situation, provisions like Sections
84 and 85 of BROA have been enacted to maintain
continuity, and at the same time authorising the States
to  make  such  modifications  and  adaptations  as  are
considered  necessary  by  mere  issuance  of  orders
within two years, and thereafter by legislation.”
This decision had referred to several earlier enactments by
the  Parliament  under  Article  3  beginning  with  the  States
Reorganisation Act, 1956 till the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000
which had similar provisions under the heading ‘Territorial extent
of  laws’  and  ‘Power  to  adapt  laws’  as  in  the  present  case.
Referring to Section 84 of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000,
which is identically worded as Section 78 of the Reorganisation
Act, this Court in Ranjan Sinha (supra) held as under:
“29.  Section 84 contains two legal fictions, first is that
the  reorganisation  of  Bihar  would  not  affect  the
applicability of laws made by the State of Bihar to all
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  29 of
38territories included in it before reorganisation and after
the reorganisation.  In other words, a law made by
Bihar shall be applicable to all the territories of the
erstwhile State of Bihar including the territories of the
State  of  Jharkhand  even  after  reorganisation.  The
second fiction is that until Jharkhand provides for it by
way of amendment or otherwise, territorial reference in
any  law  to  the  State  of  Bihar  shall  mean  all  the
territories in Bihar before reorganisation.  For instance,
if Bihar had made a law as applicable to entire Bihar, it
shall apply to Bihar and Jharkhand until it is amended
by the new State.  The territories to which the said Act
is made applicable would also include the territories
which were included in Jharkhand. Section 85 is an
enabling provision which empowers both the States to
make adaptations and modification of the law by way of
amendment  to  the  law  as  applicable  to  the  newly
formed State.” 
While  interpreting  Section  84  and  85  of  the  Bihar
Reorganisation Act, 2000 analogous to Section 78 and 79 of the
Reorganisation Act, this Court in Ranjan Sinha (supra) had dealt
with and affirmed the underlined theory of continuity of laws in the
new  state  after  or  post  the  reorganisation  observing  that  the
principle of “clean state”, as it exists in the international law in
relation to the state succession, which means that the successor
state generally does not inherit the prior treaty obligations or rights
of  a  predecessor  state,  is  different  from  the  adjustment  of
territories which the Parliament undertakes and enforces under
Article 3. The reorganised states do not usually start as  tabula
rasa,  rather  they  are  successors  of  the  pre-existing  erstwhile
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  30 of
38States. Disorderly and chaotic situation would erupt if the new
state was to be created without any laws as on the date of its
creation.  To  overcome  this  interregnum  and  vacuum,  the
Reorganisation Act(s) uniformly contain provisions which create a
legal fiction to the extent that the reorganisation of the State would
not affect the applicability of laws to all the territories included
within it before and even after the reorganisation. However, this is
subject to another dictum/rule that the existing laws as earlier
applicable to the territories would be applicable to the new state
until the new state provides for adaptation or modification of the
law by way of repeal or amendment. The time period provided for
such adaptations and modifications is generally two years from the
appointed day, i.e. the day by which the Central Government in
the Official Gazette provides for the creation of the two states by
transfer of territories from one state to another.
21.The Constitutional Bench judgment in  M.P.V. Sundararamier &
Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Another5, had examined
and  rejected  several  contentions  of  the  dealers  carrying  on
business in the city of Madras for restraining the State of Andhra
from imposing sales tax on sales effected in favour of merchants
carrying  on  business  in  the  State  of  Andhra.   One  of  the
5 AIR 1958 SC 468
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  31 of
38contentions raised related to the true interpretation of Section 53
of the Andhra State Act, 1953, the argument being that though for
political purposes the State of Andhra was a separate State, but
for  enforcement  of  laws  as  they  stood  on  the  date  of
division/bifurcation, the State of Andhra was deemed to be a part
of the State of Madras. This contention was rejected holding that
the States of Andhra and Madras were two separate States and
were governed by two separate though identical Acts. Accordingly,
when  the  sales  tax  enactment  as  applicable  had  provided  for
single levy on successive sales of yarn, it would have application
to sales in the State of Madras or Andhra, as the case may be,
and not in the other State or inter-state sales.  Section 53 had
provided that the laws in existence in the territories which were
constituted and had become part of the State of Andhra would
continue to be governed by the laws which were enacted by the
State of Madras. In terms of Section 53, the laws enacted by the
State of Madras would continue to operate as before. It had not
stipulated that the States would continue to be one. For clarity and
convenience,  we  would  reproduce  paragraph  60  of  the  said
judgment, which reads as under:
“60. (VI) Another contention urged by the petitioners is
that the levy of tax proposed to be made by the Andhra
State on the sale of yarn by them to dealers in the
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  32 of
38State of Andhra is illegal because under the Madras
Act and the Rules made thereunder, where there are
successive sales of yarn the tax can be imposed at
only one point, and as the Government of Madras had
already imposed a tax on the sale within that State, a
second levy on the selfsame goods by the State of
Andhra  is  unauthorised  and  that  therefore  the
threatened  proceedings  for  assessment  are
incompetent.  This  contention  is  clearly  untenable.
When the Madras Act provides for a single levy on
successive sales of yarn, it can have only application to
sales  in  the  State  of  Madras,  as  it  would  be
incompetent to the Legislature of Madras to enact a
law to operate in another State.  But it is argued that
S.53  of  the  Andhra  State  Act,  1953  on  its  true
interpretation enacts that though for political purposes
Andhra is to be regarded as a separate State, for the
enforcement  of  laws  as  they  stood  on  that  date  it
should be deemed to be a part of the State of Madras.
We do not agree with this interpretation. In our opinion,
S. 53 merely provides that the laws in existence in the
territories  which  were  constituted  into  the  State  of
Andhra should continue to operate as before. In fact,
by an Adaptation Order issued on November 12, 1953,
even the name of Andhra was substituted for Madras in
the  Madras  General  Sales  Tax  Act.  There  is  no
substance in this contention.”
22.In the context of the above provisions of the Reorganisation Act,
we would now reproduce relevant portion of the judgment of the
Division Bench of High Court of Andhra Pradesh in  Sri Peera
Mohammad  Mahamood  Saheb  v.  The  State  of  Andhra
Pradesh (supra), which had also dealt with the situation pursuant
to bifurcation of the State of Madras into the reorganised State of
Madras  and  the  new  State  of  Andhra.  Referring  to  identical
provisions, it was held that Section 3 of the Andhra State Act,
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  33 of
381953  states  that  the  territories  enumerated  would,  from  the
appointed date i.e. 1st October, 1953, cease to be the territories of
the State of Madras and would be the territories of the new State
of Andhra. Further, the laws in force in the territories in the State of
Andhra prior to its constitution shall continue to remain in force
even after its creation. Accordingly, one of the Acts namely the
Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, would continue to apply to
the new State of Andhra and the word ‘Madras’ used in said Act
would be replaced/substituted by the word ‘Andhra’. To this extent,
Section 53 of the Andhra State Act which is pari materia to Section
78 of the Reorganisation Act, 2000, declares that notwithstanding
the emergence of the State of Andhra, there shall be no change in
the laws in force. This provision was made for avoiding any hiatus
and  the  same  set  of  laws,  therefore,  would  continue  to  be
operative in the States of Madras and Andhra.
23.We have quoted the relevant portions of the judgment in the case
of Swarn Rekha Cokes and Coals Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and have no
difficulty in agreeing to the dictum as enunciated in paragraphs 26,
27 and 28, but find it difficult to agree with the ratio recorded in
paragraph  29.  The  effect  of  Sections  84  and  85  of  the  Bihar
Reorganisation Act, 2000 was to ensure continuity of laws enacted
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  34 of
38by the unified State of Bihar in the new State of Jharkhand which
had been created by transfer of territories which earlier formed
part of the State of Bihar. These sections incorporating a deeming
fiction were to ensure that the new State of Jharkhand would
continue to be governed by the pre-existing laws as, otherwise,
there would be a disorderly and chaotic situation where the new
State would not be governed by any law.  This is the true effect of
the legal fiction created by Section 84 of the Bihar Reorganisation
Act, 2000, i.e., the reorganisation of the state would not affect the
applicability  of  the  existing  laws  in  the  state  to  all  territories
included within it before and even after the reorganisation. The
said fiction does not postulate and cannot be extended to imagine
that  for  the  purpose  of  sale  transactions  or  even  for  other
purposes,  the  new  state  did  not  have  any  political  and
constitutional existence as a separate state and that till a new law
was enacted, the two States were to be treated as one political
State as it was before the reorganisation. The sale transactions
which were hitherto intra-state sales being within the unified State
of Bihar, would become inter-state transactions once the two new
States had come into existence. Provisions do not stipulate that
such  transactions  would  continue  to  be  treated  as  intra-state
transactions notwithstanding creation of the new State.
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  35 of
3824.With respect to reasoning given in paragraph 30 in Swarn Rekha
Cokes and Coals Pvt. Ltd. (supra), we would acknowledge that
creation of a new State was an unforeseen event and could give
rise to unusual situations, but this cannot be a ground and reason
to treat inter-state sales between the two successor states as
intra-state sales. This would be contrary to the Constitution and
even the Statute i.e. the Reorganisation Act. Whenever a new
State is created, there would be difficulties and, issues would arise
but  these  have  to  be  dealt  within  the  parameters  of  the
constitutional  provisions  and  the  law  and  not  by  negating  the
mandate of the Parliament which has created the new state in
terms of Article 3 of the Constitution. Creation of the new political
State  must  be  given  full  legal  effect.  We  would,  therefore,
respectfully overrule the contrary observations and ratio recorded
in paragraphs 29 and 30 in Swarn Rekha Cokes and Coals Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) in light of the legal position elucidated and explained
above. 
25.In the end, we must take note of one of the submissions made by
the  private  parties/assessee that  under the  exemption  clauses
even the inter-state transactions were entitled to some benefits.
This contention was not raised in the writ petition or even in the
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  36 of
38pleadings before us and has been urged and argued for the first
time. We would not like to comment and decide this contention in
vacuum and leave it open to the private parties/assessee to raise
this plea before the authorities in appropriate proceedings under
the statute. In other words, the authorities would examine whether
the inter-state transactions were entitled to any benefit and if so,
whether the private parties/assessee herein fulfil and meet the
requirements to claim such benefit. We have not expressed any
opinion either way on this contention. It was pointed out that in
several cases adjudication orders may have been passed and the
private parties/assessee may not have preferred appeals in view
of the writ petitions filed by them and the present proceedings. As
recorded  above,  some  of  the  private  parties/assessee  had
succeeded before the High Court. We would observe that it will be
open to the private parties/assessee to challenge the adjudication
orders in accordance with law and if required, by filing application
under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, or other applicable
provisions of the state enactments for exclusion of time during
which the proceedings have remained pending before the High
Court and this Court. In such cases, it would be appropriate for the
authorities to exclude such time period as we are overruling the
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23592 of 2014 & Ors. Page  37 of
38ratio laid down in paragraphs 29 and 30 in Swarn Rekha Cokes
and Coals Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
26.Accordingly, the appeals arising from Special Leave Petition (Civil)
Nos. 10520 of 2013, 1334, 10165, 23297, 23592 of 2014, 6729
and 16550 of 2016 preferred by the State of Madhya Pradesh and
the State of Chhattisgarh are allowed and the Civil Appeal Nos.
460, 461, 7073 of 2005 and 2343 of 2007 preferred by the private
parties/assessee  are  dismissed  in  terms  of  the  aforesaid
observations, findings and directions.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1211 OF 2014

VERSUS
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH …..        RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
SANJIV KHANNA, J.
The sole appellant, Munawwar, in this appeal assails his
conviction for murder and kidnapping of a seven-year old boy, ‘X’
under Sections 302 and 365 read with Section 34 of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ‘IPC’) as also causing disappearance
of evidence of offence under Section 201 read with Section 34
IPC.  The appellant stands sentenced to undergo imprisonment
for  life,  seven  years  and  three  years  rigorous  imprisonment
respectively, which sentences, it is directed, shall run concurrently
(no separate sentence for fine has been imposed but we are not
commenting and examining this aspect in the present appeal and
judgment).
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 1 of 92.Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the principle
of last seen has been wrongly invoked, for even if the Court were
to accept the testimony of Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2), Ashraf (PW-3),
Sayeed Ahmed (PW-5), and Mustak (PW-7), ‘X’ was last seen in
the company of the appellant, along with the appellant’s brothers
Noor  Mohammad,  Tahir  (since  deceased)  and  a  third  person
Shamim, at Laddawala, Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh on April 01,
1988, whereas two ransom notes were purportedly received by
Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1), father of ‘X’, on April 03, 1988 and April
07, 1988, and subsequently, ‘X’s dead body was exhumed at a
different  location  on  April  18,  1988.  Reference  was  made  to
Jaswant Gir vs. State of Punjab1 and State of Goa vs. Sanjay
Thakran & Another2. The appellant also submitted that there was
a  delay  in  recording  the  First  Information  Report  (FIR)  under
Section  365  IPC,  which,  it  was  highlighted,  was  registered  at
Police Station, Kotwali, Muzaffarnagar on April 07, 1988 at about
9:40 p.m.
3.We have considered the contentions but do not find any good
ground  and  reason  to  differ  and  upset  concurrent  finding  of
conviction as recorded by the Additional District and Sessions
1 (2005) 12 SCC 4382 (2007) 3 SCC 755
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 2 of 9Judge vide judgment dated August 19, 1992 and in the impugned
judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated March 08, 2013.   
4.Co-accused and convicts Noor Mohammad and Shamim have not
filed an appeal before this Court and Tahir as noticed above has
since died. Hence, we are examining and deciding the present
appeal preferred by Munawwar.
5.The fact that ‘X’, son of Mohd. Khurshid who has appeared as
PW-1, was kidnapped on April 01, 1988 and his dead body was
exhumed on the basis of the disclosure statement made by Noor
Mohammad on April 18, 1988 has been proved and established
beyond debate and doubt.  It is also an accepted position that the
appellant-Munawwar, Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased)
are brothers.  Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1) in his deposition was lucid
that his seven-year old son, ‘X’, who had gone to a neighbourhood
shop on asking of his mother to purchase dal at about 4 p.m. on
April 01, 1988 did not return and was untraceable.  PW-1, who
was working in the Tehsil, on return from work had searched and
looked desperately for ‘X’ but without success.  Upon enquiring in
the neighbourhood, PW-1 had learnt that ‘X’ was last seen with
Noor Mohammad at the shop of Ashraf, as told to him by Ashraf
who  had  deposed  as  PW-3  and  confirmed  the  fact.  Mohd.
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 3 of 9Khurshid (PW-1) had also spoken to Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2), who
was standing a few feet away from the shop of Ashraf (PW-3), and
had seen ‘X’ with the appellant- Munawwar, Noor Mohammad,
Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim who had taken ‘X’ with them
on foot towards Sultan Industries.  This narration was affirmed by
Mohd.  Sayeed  (PW-2),  who  had  seen  ‘X’ in  the  lap  of  Noor
Mohammad as they had moved out of the shop to the road where
the  appellant-Munawwar,  Tahir  (since  deceased)  and  Shamim
were present.  Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2) had also testified that the
accused were maternal uncles of ‘X’ and they would daily take ‘X’
for a walk and get things for him to eat. Therefore, PW-2 had no
reason to suspect and did not deem it proper to intervene.  PW-2
has confirmed his interaction with PW-1 in the evening when PW-
1 had made enquiries about his son.  
6.We have the testimony of Mustak (PW-7), who has stated that he
knew ‘X’, son of Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1), who were residing in the
same  mohalla.   On  April  01,1988  at  about  5  p.m.  PW-7  had
returned  from  Devband  by  bus.  While  proceeding  towards
Laddawala, PW-7 had seen ‘X’ with the appellant- Munawwar,
Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim, who were
taking him towards the hill.  He had not objected because he knew
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 4 of 9that the persons were relatives of ‘X’ and had thought that they
were possibly taking him for a walk.
7.Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1) has deposed that on April 03,1988 he had
received ransom letter (Ext. 1) for payment of Rs. 21,000/- for safe
release  of  ‘X’.   Money  was  to  be  paid  at  the  railway  bridge.
Thereupon, PW-1 had proceeded to the house of the appellant
Munawwar and his brothers and had met Tahir (since deceased)
and had informed him about the ransom note and enquired if he
could tell him his son’s whereabouts.  Tahir (since deceased) had
thereupon asked PW-1 to arrange for the money and to write a
letter seeking 2-3 days’ time to make payment.  Several other
persons, including Kallu, were present with PW-1 at that time.  On
the request of Tahir (since deceased), PW-1 had written a letter
and gave it to Tahir (since deceased) asking for 2-3 days’ time to
arrange for money.  The aforesaid factum has been proved and
also testified by Sayeed Ahmad (PW-5) who was present with PW-
1 when the latter had spoken to Tahir (since deceased) about ‘X’
and the ransom note, and wrote the letter requesting for extension
of time to make the payment. On April 05, 1988, Tahir (since
deceased) had informed PW-1 that the letter had reached the
persons and they had given PW-1 time to arrange money.
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 5 of 98.Mohd.  Khurshid  (PW-1)  has  also  testified  about  the  second
ransom  letter (Ext.  2) for payment of  Rs.  22,000/- which  was
thrown in his house by Shamim, one of the accused, an act which
was seen by Islam (PW-4) and Sayeed Ahmad (PW-5) who had
tried to apprehend and catch Shamim but were unsuccessful as
Shamim  had  managed  to  run  away.  Islam  (PW-4)  had  also
testified that ‘X’ was missing and this fact was known to the entire
neighbourhood.
9.After receipt of the second ransom note, Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1)
had proceeded to lodge the police report/complaint vide Exhibit
KA-1.  PW-1 had testified that upon submitting the scribed report,
the  police report  was  made  and read out  to him,  and having
understood the contents, he had put his signatures. Explaining the
reason for the delay in filing the FIR, PW-1 had elucidated that he
was arranging the money and perceiving danger and threat to the
life of ‘X’, he did not initially lodge a police report. Further, till the
second ransom note was thrown by one of the accused Shamim,
PW-1 was uncertain on whether or not Tahir (since deceased) was
trying to mislead him and also on participation and involvement of
the appellant and his brothers.  PW-1 has also spoken about his
relation with the accused Shamim.  Khalil who was uncle of his
wife was the brother-in-law of the accused Shamim, a fact stated
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 6 of 9by PW-1 in the cross-examination but not controverted or put for
denial.  
10.Equally important is the evidence of recovery of the dead body of
‘X’  pursuant  to  the  disclosure  statement  made  by  Noor
Mohammad upon his arrest on April 18, 1988.  Noor Mohammad
had thereupon taken the police and PW-1 and others to Bajheri
jungle and the tube well of Irshad @ Yaseen and had shown the
place where the dead body of ‘X’, his clothes and the knife by
which he was killed had been buried in a ditch.  Thereupon, after
digging earth, the dead body of ‘X’ was exhumed, and his clothes
and the knife were recovered vide Memo, Exhibit KA-2.  PW-1 had
identified the dead body of his son ‘X’ by looking at his face.
Recovery of dead body of ‘X’ at the instance of Noor Mohammad
is a fact also affirmed by Mustak (PW-7) and Police Sub-Inspector
Raj Kishor Singh (PW-11).
11.The present case would not in a strict sense be a case of mere
‘last seen’.  ‘X’ was kidnapped at about 4:00 p.m. on April 01,
1988 when he was seen in the custody of the present appellant,
Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim near the
shop of Ashraf (PW-3).  ‘X’ was a young boy, seven years in age,
who was close to and friendly with the appellant-Munawwar, his
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 7 of 9brothers namely Noor Mohammad and Tahir (since deceased) and
also knew Shamim who was living in the neighbourhood.  The
factum that ‘X’ was kidnapped on April 01, 1988 at about 4:00 –
4:30 p.m. has been established and proved beyond doubt.  The
identity of the kidnappers which includes the present appellant has
also been established.  Reliance placed on the two judgments
relating to the “last seen” principle vide Jaswant Gir vs. State of
Punjab (supra) and State of Goa vs. Sanjay Thakran & Another
(supra)  would  not  support  the  submissions  on  behalf  of  the
appellant, for, in the present case, there is direct evidence in the
form of  ocular testimonies, as discussed above, which establish
that the present appellant and others had kidnapped and had held
their captivity.  Further, there was no time gap or interregnum
between  ‘X’s  disappearance  and  kidnapping;  they  were
simultaneous.  Subsequent  evidence,  including  the  conduct  of
Shamim, who had thrown the second ransom note, and Noor
Mohammad, who had given the disclosure statement leading to
recovery  of  the  dead  body,  would  implicate  and  establish  the
charge and the case of the prosecution.
12.Hence, we do not find any merit in the present appeal and we
affirm the judgment of the High Court accepting the judgment of
the  Additional  Sessions  Judge  convicting  the  appellant-
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 8 of 9Munawwar under Sections 302, 365 and 201 read with Section 34
of the IPC. The appeal has no merit and is dismissed.

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 684 OF 2018
BENGAL CHEMISTS & DRUGGISTS ASSN.      …APPELLANT
VERSUS
           KALYAN CHOWDHURY                                  …RESPONDENT
                       J U D G M E N T
R.F. Nariman, J.    
1)The present appeal is against an order of the National
Company Law Appellate Tribunal dated 31.07.2017 by which
the Appellate Tribunal, after setting out Section 421(3) of the
Companies Act, 2013, (for short 'the Act') has dismissed the
appeal as not maintainable, inasmuch as the appeal has been
filed 9 days after the period of limitation of 45 days has expired
and a further period of another 45 days has also expired.
2)Mr. Jayant Mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellant, has argued the matter persuasively before us.2
He points out that Section 421(3) of the Act does not contain
the language of Section 34(3) proviso of the Arbitration Act,
1996 which contains the words “but not thereafter” which Union
of India vs.  Popular  Construction  Co.  (2001)  8 SCC  470
considered.   He  further  points  out  that,  in  any case,  under
Section 433 of the Act, the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963
shall, as far as may be, apply to Appeals before the Appellate
Tribunal and that therefore, Section 5 would be applicable to
condone the delay beyond the period of 90 days.  He has
buttressed his submission by referring to various decisions of
this Court.
3)Before  coming  to  the  judgments  of  this  Court,  it  is
important to first set out Section 421(3) and Section 433 of the
Act.  These provisions read as follows:
“421. Appeal from orders of Tribunal.-
    **** **** ****
(3) Every appeal under sub-section (1) shall be
filed within a period of forty-five days from the
date  on  which  a  copy  of  the  order  of  the
Tribunal  is  made  available  to  the  person
aggrieved  and  shall  be  in  such  form,  and
accompanied  by  such  fees,  as  may  be
prescribed:3
Provided  that  the  Appellate  Tribunal  may
entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said
period of forty-five days from the date aforesaid,
but  within  a  further  period  not  exceeding
forty-five days, if it is satisfied that the appellant
was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the
appeal within that period.
433.   Limitation .-  The  provisions  of  the
Limitation Act, 1963 shall, as far as may be,
apply  to  proceedings  or  appeals  before  the
Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal, as the case
may be.”
4)A cursory reading of Section 421(3) makes it clear that the
proviso  provides  a  period  of  limitation  different  from  that
provided in the Limitation Act, and also provides a further period
not exceeding 45 days only if it is satisfied that the appellant
was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within
that period.  Section 433 obviously cannot come to the aid of
the appellant because the provisions of the Limitation Act only
apply “as far as may be”.  In a case like the present, where
there is a special provision contained in Section 421(3) proviso,
Section 5 of the Limitation Act obviously cannot apply.4
5)Another very important aspect of the case is that 45 days
is the period of limitation, and a further period not exceeding 45
days is provided only if sufficient cause is made out for filing the
appeal within the extended period.  According to us, this is a
peremptory  provision,  which  will  otherwise  be  rendered
completely ineffective, if we were to accept the argument of
learned counsel for the appellant.  If we were to accept such
argument, it would mean that notwithstanding that the further
period of 45 days had elapsed, the Appellate Tribunal may, if
the facts so warrant, condone the delay.  This would be to
render otiose the second time limit of 45 days, which, as has
been pointed out by us above, is peremptory in nature.
6)We are fortified in this conclusion by the judgment of this
Court in Chhattisgarh SEB  v. Central Electricity Regulatory
Commission, 2010 (5) SCC 23 . The language of Section 125
of the Electricity Act, 2003, which is similar to the language
contained in Section 421 (3) of the Companies Act, 2013, came
up for consideration in the aforesaid decision. The issue that
arose before this Court was whether Section 5 of the Limitation
Act can be invoked for allowing the aggrieved person to file an
appeal beyond 60 days plus the further grace period of 60 days.5
This Court held that Section 5 cannot apply to Section 125 of
the Electricity Act in the following terms:
“25. Section  125  lays  down  that  any  person
aggrieved by any decision or order of the Tribunal
can file an appeal to this Court  within 60 days from
the date of communication of the decision or order
of the Tribunal. Proviso to Section 125 empowers
this  Court  to  entertain  an  appeal  filed  within  a
further period of 60 days if it is satisfied that there
was sufficient cause for not filing appeal within the
initial period of 60 days. This shows that the period
of  limitation  prescribed  for  filing  appeals  under
Sections 111(2) and 125 is substantially different
from the period prescribed under the Limitation Act
for  filing  suits,  etc.  The  use  of  the  expression
“within a further period not exceeding 60 days” in
the proviso to Section 125 makes it clear that the
outer limit for filing an appeal is 120 days. There is
no provision in the Act under which this Court can
entertain an appeal filed against the decision or
order of the Tribunal after more than 120 days.”
The aforesaid judgment was reiterated and followed in ONGC
v. Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Limited , 2017
(5) SCC 42 at Para 5.6
7)It now remains to deal with the decisions cited by learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant.  The first is the
judgment  in  Guda  Vijayalakshmi  vs.  Guda  Ramachandra
Sekhara Sastry , (1981) 2 SCC 646.  In that case, a Transfer
Petition was filed under Section 25, CPC, 1908 in this Court.  A
preliminary objection was taken stating that in view of Sections
21 and 21A of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, Section 25 would
not be applicable.  This was turned down by this Court stating
that Section 21 would not apply to substantive provisions of the
Code as apart from procedural provisions.  Equally, Section 21A
of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 only dealt with transfers “in
certain cases”.  This being so, the wide and plenary power
conferred on this Court to transfer any suit, appeal or other
proceedings from one High Court to another High Court or from
one Civil Court in one State to another Civil Court in any other
State was held not be entrenched upon by Sections 21 and 21A
of the Hindu Marriage Act.  We fail to see how this judgment, in
any manner, furthers the proposition sought to be canvassed on
behalf of the appellant,  which is that Section 5 of the Limitation
Act would continue to apply even after a second period of 45
days is peremptorily laid down.  This judgment, therefore, does7
not carry the matter any further.
8)Reliance placed on  Dr. Partap Singh and Another  vs.
Director of Enforcement, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act
and Others  , (1985) 3 SCC 72 is equally misplaced.   In this
case, Section 37 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973
was involved.  Section 37(2) provides that the provisions of the
Code relating to searches shall, so far as may be, apply to
searches directed under Section 37(1).  This Court held that the
expression “so far as may be” has always been construed to
mean that those provisions may generally be followed to the
extent possible.  In the fact scenario of that case, it was held
that to give full meaning to the expression 'so far as may be',
sub-section (2) of Section 37 should be interpreted to mean that
broadly the procedure relating to search as enacted in Section
165 shall be followed.
9)This case again does not take the matter any further.  In
fact, the ratio of the judgment as far as this case is concerned is
that the expression “so far as may be” only means to the extent
possible.  If not possible, obviously the Limitation Act would not
apply.  We have already held that it is not possible for Section 5
of the Limitation Act to apply given the peremptory language of8
Section 421(3).
10)The  third  judgment  is  Mangu  Ram vs.  Municipal
Corporation of Delhi , (1976) 1 SCC 392.  In this judgment,
Section 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 provided
for special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal.  Section
417 (4) required that the application for special leave should be
made before the expiry period of 60 days from the date of the
order of acquittal.  Applying Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act,
this Court held that Section 5 of the Limitation would not be
impliedly excluded  in  such case  despite the  mandatory and
peremptory language contained in Section 417(4) of the Cr.P.C.
This Court held that all periods of limitation are cast in such
mandatory and peremptory language and, therefore, Section 5
could not be said to be impliedly excluded.
11)This case again is wholly distinguishable.  It applies only to
a  period  of  limitation  which  is  given  beyond  which  nothing
further is stated as to whether delay may be condoned beyond
such period.  In the present case, the Section 417(3) does not
merely contain the initial period of 45 days, in which case the
aforesaid judgment would have applied.   Section 417(3) goes
on to state that another period of 45 days, being a grace period9
given by the legislature which cannot be exceeded, alone would
apply, provided sufficient cause is made out within the aforesaid
grace period.  As has been held by us above, it is the second
period,  which  is  a  special  inbuilt  kind  of  Section  5  of  the
Limitation  Act  in  the  special  statute,  which  lays  down  that
beyond the second period of 45 days, there can be no further
condonation of delay. On this ground therefore, the aforesaid
judgment also stands distinguished. 
12)One  further  thing  remains  –  and  that  is  that  learned
counsel for the appellant pointed out the difference between the
expression used in the Arbitration Act as construed by Popular
Construction (supra) and its absence in the proviso in Section
421(3).  For the reasons given above, we are of the view that
this would also make no difference in view of the language of
the  proviso  to  Section  421(3)  which  contains  mandatory  or
peremptory negative language and speaks of a second period
not exceeding 45 days, which would have the same effect as
the expression “but not thereafter” used in Section 34(3) proviso
of the Arbitration Act, 1996.10
13)We, therefore, see no reason to interfere with the judgment
under appeal.  The appeal is dismissed.

VERSUS
Maya Prakash Jain and others       …Respondents

1.Leave granted.
2.This  appeal  challenges  the  correctness  of  the  decision  dated
19.07.2018 passed by the High Court of Judicature of Allahabad  in Civil
Revision No.156 of 2016.
3.One Vinay Prakash Jain filed Suit No.92 of 1966 (“1966 Suit”, for
short) in the Court of Sub-Judge, First Class, Delhi seeking declaration that
certain properties had fallen to his share after a partition between his father
Amba Prasad, his mother Smt. Devi Jain and three brothers, all of whom were
arrayed as Defendant Nos.1 to 5.  In the suit four sisters, including Smt
Srikanta Jain were also arrayed as Defendant Nos.6 to 9.                                        2
4.An order was passed by the trial court on 23.02.1966 in 1966 Suit
recording a compromise amongst the parties pursuant to which the suit was
decreed.  Relevant portion of the order was as under:
“The  plaintiff  has prayed  that  a declaration  be
made that he is the owner of the properties in the plaint
of the suit (illegible).  The said properties had fallen in
his  share  in  (illegible)  between  the  plaintiff  and
defendant  Nos.1  to  5.   The  defendants  have  today
through their counsel Shri Vijay Kishan, Advocate filed
written statement admitting the claim of the plaintiff.
The  counsel  for  the  defendants  has  also  made  a
statement in the Court that decree be passed as prayed
for.
In the result, I pass a decree for declaration to the
effect that the plaintiff is the owner and in possession
of the properties mentioned in clause (a) of para No.11
of the plaint.  The parties be bear their own costs of the
suit.
Pronounced.”
5. Defendant No.5 in 1966 Suit i.e. Maya Prakash thereafter filed Suit
No.464  of  2006  in  the  Court  of  Civil  Judge  (Senior  Division),  Meerut,
submitting inter alia that after the aforesaid decree dated 23.02.1966, there
was a further family settlement arrived at between all sons of said Amba
Prasad  Jain  on  05.11.2005  regarding  division  of  house  and  other  joint
properties.  This settlement was said to have been arrived at in the presence of
Smt.  Chandrakanta  Jain,  Shri  D.P.  Jain,  Smt.  Padamkanta  Jain  and  Shri                                      3
Akhilesh Jain.  It was claimed that the parties were bound by said settlement
dated 05.11.2005 and that in pursuance thereof said Maya Prakash Jain was
exclusive owner of certain properties mentioned in the schedule to the plaint
in said suit of 2006.
6. An application Ex.92 Ka was preferred by original Defendant No.8 in
1966 Suit i.e. Srikanta Jain seeking her impleadment as one of the defendants
in aforesaid Suit No.464 of 2006.  It was submitted that after the death of her
parents i.e. Amba Prasad Jain, and Smt. Devi Jain, the applicant was entitled
to the property which was left behind by the parents and the applicant being a
necessary party she ought to be impleaded as one of the defendants in Suit
No.464 of 2006.  During the pendency of the application, Smt. Srikanta Jain
expired and the appellants, i.e. her legal heirs were substituted in her place.
7.   The application was dismissed by the trial court vide order dated
10.03.2016.   It  was  observed  that  the  applicant  Smt.  Srikanta  Jain  had
knowledge of 1966 Suit but no steps were taken to appeal against the decree
passed on the basis of oral family partition between her parents and brothers
and as such her application was required to be dismissed.
8. The appellants being aggrieved, preferred Civil Revision No.156 of
2016 in the High Court, which revision was dismissed by the High Court vide
order dated 19.07.2018.  It was observed as under:                                      4
“Since, as noticed above, the suit where from this revision
arises basically seeks implementation of an earlier decree in
Suit No.92 of 1966, which determined the shares of the parties
thereto, upon acceptance of an alleged oral partition between
them, and since admittedly the parties to the suit are only those
whose  shares  are  to  be  separated,  the  Court  below  has
committed  no  illegality  in  rejecting  the  impleadment
application,  on  a  finding  that  revisionist  are  not  necessary
parties In the proceedings.”
9.We heard Shri D.K. Garg, learned Advocate for the appellants and
Shri Jitender Mohan Sharma, learned Senior Advocate for the respondents.
10.  The earlier suit was filed by a son against his parents, three brothers
and four sisters.  In terms of compromise entered into between the Plaintiff,
the parents and three brothers, the properties were mutually divided amongst
said six persons.  Since Amba Prasad Jain and Smt. Devi Jain were alive, the
proper parties in an action seeking relief of partition of joint family estate,
going by the then prevailing principles of Hindu Law, were only the husband,
wife and their sons.  The daughters in the family, namely, Defendant Nos.6 to
9 could not, as a matter of right, claim any share if the joint family properties
were to be partitioned.  However, it is well settled1 that if a partition takes
place between her husband and sons, a wife is entitled (except in Southern
India) to receive a share equal to that of a son and enjoy that share separately
1 See: Lakshmi Chand Khajuria and Ors vs.  Ishroo Devi – (1977) 2 SCC 501 para 14                                      5
even from her husband2.  Therefore, if the compromise was entered into
between the Plaintiff and Defendant Nos.1 to 5, there was nothing improper
about it.  In the circumstances, the absence of any challenge to the decree in
1966 Suit was irrelevant.  As a matter of fact, the applicant Srikanta Jain
could not have challenged the decree in 1966 Suit.
11.On the death of the father and mother, if they died intestate, then
under the principles of the Hindu Succession Act, every Class I heir including
the daughters, would be entitled to a share in the property left behind by their
parents.  It is precisely on this count that the applicant Srikanta Jain claims to
be entitled to have a share in the properties which were allocated to Amba
Prasad Jain and Smt. Devi Jain.  The partition effected pursuant to decree in
1966 Suit cannot, in any way, disentitle her from claiming a share in the
properties of her father and mother.  In the aforesaid premises, Srikanta Jain
was definitely a necessary and proper party to be impleaded in the subsequent
suit which was filed by Maya Prakash Jain.  
12.It was, however, contended by Mr. Jitender Mohan Sharma, learned
Senior  Advocate  appearing  for  Respondent  No.1  that  the  father  and  the
mother, namely, Amba Prasad Jain and Smt. Devi Jain had left behind Wills
under which their properties had devolved upon the sons exclusively.  The due
2 Mulla on Hindu Law – 22nd Edition Page 496                                      6
execution of the Wills is yet to the proved by the Respondents.  If the Wills
are not proved, the daughters would be entitled to a share in the properties,
being Class-I heirs.  The daughters are, therefore, necessary parties to the
proceedings.  In the present case, if the Wills so propounded are proved, they
will chart a course of succession other than the normal mode of succession
and to the prejudice of the daughters.   In such an action or proceeding, the
daughters being Class I heirs are necessary and proper parties and are required
to be impleaded. 
13.Thus,  considering  the  matter  from  any  perspective,  the  applicant
Srikanta  Jain  was  a  necessary  and  proper  party.   Her  application  to  be
impleaded as one of the defendants in the suit, was erroneously rejected by
the courts below.  We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the order passed
by the courts below, and allow the application Ext.92 Ka filed under Order 1
Rule 10 CPC preferred by the applicant Srikanta Jain in Suit No.464 of 2006.
No costs.

CIVIL ORIGINAL  JURISDICTION
WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 448 OF 2017
KRISHNA MOHAN MEDICAL COLLEGE 
AND HOSPITAL & ANR.            ….PETITIONERS
VERSUS
UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER        ….RESPONDENTS
WITH 
I.A. NO. 73716 OF 2017
JUDGMENT
AMITAVA ROY, J.
The challenge laid in this petition under Article 32 of
the Constitution of India at its institution was mounted on
the order dated 31.05.2017, whereby the respondent - Union
of India had directed debarment of the petitioner college i.e.
Krishna  Mohan  Medical  College,  Mathura  from  admitting
students in the MBBS course for the academic years 2017-18
and 2018-19 and at the same time authorized the Medical
Council of India (for short, hereinafter to be  referred to as
“MCI”)  to  encash  the  bank  guarantee  of  Rs.  2  crores2
submitted by the petitioners.  This Court, after hearing the
parties, by order dated 01.08.2017 rendered in a batch of
writ petitions including the one in hand, the lead petition
being Writ Petition  (C) No.  411 of  2017  (Glocal Medical
College  and  Super  Specialty  Hospital  and  Research
Centre vs. Union of India and Another),  while annulling
the  above  order,  remitted  the  matter  to  the  Central
Government  with the direction to extend  fresh consideration
of the materials on record and after affording an opportunity
of  hearing  to  the  petitioners'  Colleges/Institutions  to  the
extent necessary, deliver a reasoned decision on the issue of
confirmation  or  otherwise  of  the  conditional  letter  of
permission (for short “LOP”) granted to them.  The second
round of contest witnessed by the instant  interim application
under  consideration,  has  been  precipitated  by  the  order
dated  10.08.2017  passed  by  the  Central  Government  in
purported  compliance  of  the  directions  contained  in  this
Court's order dated 01.08.2017 referred to hereinabove.
2.We  have  heard  Mr.  P.S.  Patwalia,  learned  senior
counsel  for  the  petitioners,  Mr.  Maninder  Singh,  learned3
Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India  and Mr.
Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel for the Medical Council
of India.
3.A  brief  preface  of  the  factual  backdrop  has  to  be
outlined being indispensable.  The petitioners, as required
under  the  Indian  Medical  Council  Act,  1956,  (for  short,
hereafter  to  be  referred  to  as  “The  Act”)  and  the
Establishment  of  Medical  College  Regulations,  1999
(abbreviated  hereinafter  as  the  “Regulations”)  framed
thereunder  did  submit  a  scheme/application  for
establishment of a new medical college at Mathura, Uttar
Pradesh in the name and style of Krishna Mohan Medical
College  &  Hospital,  Mathura  (hereinafter  referred  to  as
“College” as well) for the academic year 2016-17 before the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Department of Health
and  Family Welfare) Government of India.  The Ministry
forwarded  the  application  to  the  MCI  for  evaluation  and
recommendations as per the Act, whereafter the latter caused
an  inspection  to  be  made  of  the  college  on  18th &  19th
December, 2015.  According to the MCI, several deficiencies4
having  been  detected,  it  recommended  to  the  Central
Government not to issue LOP for establishment of a new
college for the academic year 2016-17.
4.According to the respondents, the Central Government
through its Hearing Committee, afforded an opportunity of
hearing to the petitioners thereafter and on an examination
amongst  others,  of  the  compliance  verification  and
assessment carried out thereafter, found several persisting
deficiencies.  
5.Skipping  over  the  inessential  intermediate  stages,
suffice it would be to state that though in view of the above
exercise undertaken, the Central Government disapproved
the application of the petitioners for establishment of the
new college for the academic year 2016-17 and accepted the
recommendations  of  the  MCI,  on  the  intervention  of  the
Oversight Committee, constituted by this Court, by its order
dated 02.05.2016 rendered in Modern Dental College and
Research  Centre  and  others  vs.  State  of  Madhya
Pradesh and others1, principally to oversee  all statutory
1(2016) 7 SCC 3535
functions under the Act and to issue appropriate remedial
directions,  the  Central  Government,  in  terms  of  the
recommendations  of  the  Oversight  Committee  dated
29.08.2016, issued a  LOP for establishment of the petitioner
college with an annual intake of 150 MBBS seats for the
academic year 2016-17 subject to the following conditions:
“(i)  An  affidavit  from  the
Dean/Principal and Chairman of the
Trust/Society/  University/Company
etc.  concerned,  affirming  fulfillment
of  all  deficiencies  and  statements
made  in  the  respective  compliance
report  submitted  to  MHFW  by  22
June 2016.
(ii)  A bank guarantee in the amount
of Rs. 2 crore in favour of MCI, which
will be valid for 1 year or until the
first renewal assessment, whichever is
later.  Such bank guarantee will be in
addition  to  the  prescribed  fee
submitted along with the application.
2.   The  OC  has  also  stipulated  as
follows:
(a)  OC may direct inspection to verify
the  compliance  submitted  by  the
college  and  considered  by  OC,
anytime after 30 September, 2016.6
(b)  In default of the conditions (I) and
(ii)  in  para  1  above  and  if  the
compliances are found incomplete in
the inspection to be conducted after
30 September, 2016, such college will
be  debarred  from  fresh  intake  of
students  for  2  years  commencing
2017-18.”
6.The letter, amongst others mentioned as well that the
next batch of students in the MBBS Course for the academic
year 2017-18 would be  admitted in the College only after
obtaining permission of the Central Government and fulfilling
the  conditions  as  above,  as  stipulated  by  the  Oversight
Committee.
7.While pursuant to the above letter of permission, the
petitioners admitted students for the academic year 2016-17
and  furnished   the  bank  guarantee  of   Rs.  2  crores  as
required and as claimed by them also did submit the affidavit
affirming fulfillment of all deficiencies and statements made
in the relevant compliance report,  the MCI caused  another
inspection  of  the  college  to  be  made  on  18th and  19th
November, 2016, in course whereof, according to it, several
deficiencies were noticed, amongst others in the faculty  at7
32.31% and in  residents at 34.78%, which however at the
spot  itself,  were  disputed/denied  by  the  authorized
representatives of the petitioners.  This, to be precise, would
be evident on the face of the inspection report annexed to the
interim  application  No.  73716  of  2017,  the  authenticity
whereof has not been questioned by the respondents.  The
petitioners, on the very same date i.e. 19.11.2016, did also
submit  a  representation  before  the  MCI  providing  the
detailed  information  supported  by  contemporaneous  facts
and  records  contradicting  the  findings  of  deficiencies,  as
recorded  by  the  assessors,  detailed  by  the  MCI.  To  be
specific, the representation contained exhaustive materials
pertaining to the alleged deficiencies in faculty and residents,
as recorded during the inspection conducted on 19.11.2016.
8.While the matter rested at that and the representation
was pending before the MCI, it deputed a team of assessors
for  carrying  out  surprise  assessment  of  the  college  on
09.12.2016. The  petitioners have   pleaded that as   this
inspection was close on the heels of the one, conducted on
19.11.2016 and their representation vis-a-vis the deficiencies8
pointed  out  therein  was  pending  consideration,  they
intimated the MCI of their inability to partake in the exercise,
as  proposed.   The  Executive  Committee  of  the  MCI
subsequent  thereto  in  its  meeting  on  22.12.2016  though
noted  the representation dated 19.11.2016, did not deal with
the  explanation  offered  by  the  petitioners  on  merits  and
instead took note of their purported non-cooperation in the
proposed  inspection  of  the  college  on  09.12.2016  and
recommended to the Central Government that the petitioners
college be debarred from admitting students in the MBBS
Course for the  two academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19 for
having  failed  to  fulfill  their  undertaking  of  removing  the
deficiencies  and  providing  the  infrastructure,  as  required
under the Regulations.
9.The  Central  Government,  thereafter  afforded  an
opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  petitioners  on  17.01.2017
through a Hearing Committee, in which the Director General
of Health Services (for short, hereafter to be referred to as
“DGHS”) did participate and finally  the proceedings thereof
were forwarded to the Central Government and the Oversight9
Committee  for the necessary decision.  As had been noted
inter  alia in  the  order  dated  01.08.2017  alluded  to
hereinabove, whereby the issue of confirmation or otherwise
of the LOP of the petitioner college/institution was remitted
to the Central Government for a fresh consideration, only a
truncated version of the said proceedings were forwarded to
the Oversight Committee  sans the observations of the DGHS
on the various aspects pertaining to the issue involved. Be
that  as  it  may,  as  the  records  testify,  the  Oversight
Committee  on an independent consideration of the materials
on record laid before it by the Central Government, though
belatedly, offered its observations on the various deficiencies
pointed  out  in  the  inspection  held  on  18th and  19th
November,  2016  and  recommended  confirmation  of  the
conditional LOP granted on 12.09.2016.  The order dated
31.05.2017 of the Central Government followed debarring
the  petitioners  college  from  admitting  students  for  two
academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19 and authorizing the
MCI  to  encash  the  bank  guarantee  of  Rs.  2  crores.   To
reiterate, this order was challenged in the writ petition in10
hand, wherein the following reliefs have been prayed for:
“(a)   Issue  a  Writ  Order  or  direction
quashing  the  order  of  Respondent
No.1-Union  of  India  contained  in  letter
No.  U-12012/127/2016-ME-I  [3084749]
dated  31.05.2017  debarring  the
Petitioners  from  taking  admission  in
MBBS  Course  for  academic  sessions
2017-2018  and  2018-20189  and
authorizing  Respondent  No.2-MCI  to
encash the bank guarantee of Rs.2 Cr.
furnished by the Petitioners to MCI; and 
(b)  Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any
Writ, Order or direction in the nature of
Mandamus directing the Respondents to
grant renewal of permission for academic
year  2017-18  and  also  permit  the
petitioner  to  admit  the  students  for
academic year 2017-2018; and/or
(c)  Issue or pass any writ, direction or
order,  which  this  Hon'ble  Court  may
deem fit and proper under the facts and
circumstances of the case.”
10.After  hearing  the  parties  and  on  a  prima  facie
consideration  of  the   materials  available  including  the
documents  furnished  by  the  parties,  this  Court  interfered
with the order dated 31.05.2017 and directed the Central
Government to consider afresh the same by reevaluating the
recommendations/views of MCI, Hearing Committee, DGHS11
and  the  Oversight  Committee,  as  available  and  also  after
affording  an  opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  petitioners
college/institution  to  the  extent  necessary  and  thereafter
pass a reasoned order.  A time frame of 10 days was also
fixed for the purpose. 
11.The  overwhelming  premise  in  which  the  above
direction was issued can be culled out from the following
excerpts of the aforementioned order dated 01.08.2017.
“21.A bare perusal of the letter dated
31.05.2017  would  demonstrate  in  clear
terms that the same is de hors any reason
in  support  thereof.   It  mentions  only
about the grant of conditional permission
on  the  basis  of  the  approval  of  the
Oversight Committee, and an  opportunity
of hearing vis-à-vis the recommendations
of the MCI in its letter dated 15.01.2017
highlighting  the  deficiencies  detected  in
course of the inspection  undertaken on
21st and  22nd December,  2016,  but   is
conspicuously  silent  with  regard  to  the
outcome of the proceedings of the Hearing
Committee,  the  recommendations
recorded therein  both  of the  Committee
and  the  DGHS  and  more  importantly
those  of  the  Oversight  Committee
conveyed  by  its  communication  dated
14.05.2017, all earlier in point of time to
the  decision  taken.  This  assumes
importance  in  view  of  the  unequivocal
mandate  contained  in  the  proviso  to12
Section 10A(4) of the Act, dealing with the
issue, amongst others of establishment of
a medical college.  The relevant excerpt of
sub-section 4 of Section 10A of the Act for
ready reference is set out hereinbelow :
“(4) The Central Government may, after
considering  the  scheme  and  the
recommendations  of  the  Council  under
sub-section (3) and after obtaining, where
necessary, such other particulars as may
be  considered  necessary by  it from  the
person or college concerned, and having
regard  to  the  factors  referred  to  in
sub-section (7), either approve (with such
conditions,  if  any,  as  it  may  consider
necessary) or disapprove the scheme and
any such approval shall be a permission
under sub-section (1) ;
Provided  that  no  scheme  shall  be
disapproved by the Central Government
except after giving the person or college
concerned  a  reasonable  opportunity  of
being heard:”
22.    Though as the records testify, a
hearing  was  provided  to  the  petitioner
colleges/institutions through the Hearing
Committee constituted by the DGHS (as
mentioned  in  the  proceedings  dated
23.3.2017)  qua  the  recommendations  of
the  MCI  contained  in  its  letter  dated
15.01.2017,   as  noted  hereinabove,  the
proceedings of the Hearing Committee do
reflect  varying  views  of  the  Hearing
Committee  and  the  DGHS,  the  latter
recommending various aspects bearing on13
deficiency to be laid before the OC for an
appropriate  decision.   The  Central
Government did forward, albeit a pruned
version  of the proceedings of the Hearing
Committee  to  the  Oversight  Committee
after a time lag of almost six weeks.  The
reason  therefor  is  however  not
forthcoming.  The Oversight Committee, to
reiterate, though on a consideration of all
the relevant facts as well as the views of
the  MCI  and  the  proceedings  of  the
Hearing Committee as laid before it, did
cast aside  the deficiencies minuted by the
MCI  and  recommended  confirmation  of
the letters of permission of the petitioner
colleges/institutions,  the  impugned
decision has been taken by the Central
Government which on the face of it does
not contain any reference whatsoever of
all these developments .
23.    As  a  reasonable  opportunity  of
hearing contained in the proviso to Section
10A(4)  is an  indispensable  pre-condition
for disapproval by the Central Government
of  any  scheme  for  establishment  of  a
medical college, we are of the convinced
opinion  that  having  regard  to  the
progression  of  events  and  the
divergent/irreconcilable
views/recommendations  of  the  MCI,  the
Hearing  Committee,  the  DGHS  and  the
Oversight Committee, the impugned order,
if  sustained  in  the  singular  facts  and
circumstances, would be in disaccord with
the letter and spirit of the prescription of
reasonable opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner  institutions/colleges ,  as
enjoined under Section 10A(4) of the Act.14
This  is  more  so  in  the  face  of  the
detrimental consequences with which they
would be visited.  It cannot be gainsaid
that  the  reasonable  opportunity  of
hearing, as obligated  by Section 10A(4)
inheres  fairness   in  action  to  meet  the
legislative  edict .   With  the  existing
arrangement  in  place,  the  MCI,  the
Central Government and for that matter,
the Hearing Committee, DGHS, as in the
present  case,  the  Oversight  Committee
and  the  concerned  colleges/institutions
are  integral  constituents  of  the  hearing
mechanism so much so that severance of
any  one  or  more   of  these,  by  any
measure,  would  render  the  process
undertaken to be mutilative  of the  letter
and  spirit  of  the  mandate  of  Section
10A(4).
24.Having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
Oversight Committee has been constituted
by this Court  and is also  empowered to
oversee all statutory functions under the
Act, and further all policy decisions of the
MCI  would  require  its  approval,  its
recommendations, to state the least, on the
issue of establishment of a medical college,
as  in  this  case,  can  by  no  means  be
disregarded  or left out of consideration.
Noticeably,  this  Court  did  also  empower
the  Oversight  Committee  to  issue
appropriate  remedial  directions.   In  our
view,  in  the  overall  perspective,   the
materials on record bearing on the claim of
the  petitioner  institutions/colleges  for
confirmation  of  the  conditional  letters  of
permission granted to them require a fresh
consideration to obviate the possibility of15
any injustice in the process.
25.   In the above persuasive premise, the
Central Government is hereby ordered to
consider  afresh  the  materials  on  record
pertaining to the issue of confirmation or
otherwise  of  the  letter  of  permission
granted  to  the  petitioner
colleges/institutions.  We make it clear that
in  undertaking  this  exercise,  the  Central
Government  would  re-evaluate   the
recommendations/views  of  the  MCI,
Hearing  Committee,  DGHS  and  the
Oversight  Committee,  as  available  on
records.   It  would  also  afford  an
opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  petitioner
colleges/institutions  to  the  extent
necessary.  The  process  of  hearing  and
final reasoned decision thereon, as ordered,
would be completed peremptorily  within a
period of 10 days from today.  The parties
would unfailingly co-operate in compliance
of  this  direction  to  meet  the  time  frame
fixed.” 
12.It  would  thus  be  patently  evident  from  the  above
operative  directions,  that  the  Central  Government  in
accordance therewith was required to consider afresh the
materials on record pertaining to the issue of confirmation or
otherwise of the letter of permission granted to the petitioner
college  and  in  undertaking  the  said  exercise,  it  was
imperative for it to reevaluate the recommendations/views of16
the  MCI,  Hearing  Committee,  DGHS  and  the  Oversight
Committee, as available and also to afford an opportunity of
hearing  to  the  petitioner  college/institution  to  the  extent
necessary. It  is  in  this  background  that  the  order  dated
10.08.2017 rendered thereafter and oppugned in the interim
application impelling the instant adjudicative pursuit, needs
to be analyzed.
13.Paragraph 17 of the order dated 10.08.2017 recites the
following in endorsement of the reiteration, by the Central
Government of its decision dated 31.05.2017 to debar the
petitioner college/institution from admitting students for a
period of two academic years i.e. 2017-18 and 2018-19 and
to  authorize  the  MCI  to  encash  bank  guarantee  of  Rs.2
crores.
“17. Now, in compliance with the above
direction  of  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court
dated  1.8.2017,  the  Ministry  granted
hearing to the college on 3.8.2017,  The
Hearing  Committee  after  considering
the  records  an  oral  &  written
submission of the college submitted its
report to the Ministry.  The findings of
the Hearing Committee are as under:
The college did not allow inspection on17
09.12.2016  on  the  ground  that
compliance  inspection  was  already
carried out on 18-19 November, 2016.
The  letter  dated  09.12.2016  from  the
Principal  clearly  mentions  that  the
college is not ready for inspection.  The
assessors have  noted that  the  college
appeared closed on 09.12.2016.
In  the  SAF  form  for  November
inspection,  the  deficiency  relating  to
faculty and residents each is in excess
of 30%.
In the opinion of the Committee, MCI
was  not  precluded  from  conducting
Inspection subject to sufficient reason
and  justification.   The  Committee
agrees with the decision of the Ministry
conveyed by letter dated 31.05.2017 to
debar the college for 2 years and also
permit MCI to encash bank guarantee.
18.  Accepting the recommendations of
the  Hearing  Committee,  the  Ministry
reiterates  its  earlier  decision  dated
31.05.2017 to debar the college for 2
years and also permit MCI to encash
bank guarantee.”
14.A plain reading of the above quoted text would yield
the  following  reasons,  as  recorded  by  the  Central
Government, to justify the impugned decision:
(a)  The  college  did  not  allow  inspection  on
09.12.2016  on  the  ground  that  compliance18
inspection  had  already  been  carried  out  on
18th/19th November, 2016.
(b)  The letter dated 09.12.2016 of the Principal
of the college/institution clearly mentions that
the college was not ready for inspection.
(c)  The Assessors have noted that the college
appeared to be closed on 09.12.2016.
(d)  In the SAF Form for November inspection,
the deficiency relating to faculty and residents
each is in excess of 30%.
(e)  In the opinion of the Hearing Committee,
MCI  was  not  precluded  from  conducting
successive  inspections  subject  to  sufficient
reason and justification.
(f)   The Hearing Committee agrees with the
decision of the Ministry conveyed by the letter
dated 31.05.2017 to debar the college for two
academic years and to permit MCI to encash
the bank guarantee.19
15.Broadly therefore, two reasons have weighed with the
Hearing Committee to reiterate the earlier decision of the
Central  Government  for  debarring  the  petitioner
college/institution from admitting students for the academic
years 2017-18 and 2018-19 and for authorizing the MCI to
encash the bank guarantee of Rs. two crores.  Firstly, the
petitioner  college/institution  did  not  allow  inspection  on
09.12.2016 and secondly, in the inspection conducted on
18-19.11.2016, deficiencies relating to Faculty and Resident
Doctors was found each to be in excess of 30%. 
16.Mr. Patwalia, learned senior counsel for the petitioners
has  insistently  argued  that  the  endeavour  to  conduct  a
second inspection merely within three weeks of the earlier
exercise conducted on 18-19.11.2016 was impermissible and
further  in  the  facts  of  the  case  lacks  bona  fide more
particularly,  when  the  alleged  deficiencies  noticed  in  the
earlier inspection had been controverted by the petitioner
college/institution  in  its  detailed  representation,
consideration  whereof  was  pending.   Further  the  Hearing
Committee  did  not  make  any  attempt  whatsoever  to20
independently  re-examine/re-evaluate  the  materials  on
record,  as  directed  by  this  Court  by  its  order  dated
01.08.2017,  thus  rendering  the  impugned  order  dated
10.08.2017  ex facie illegal and non est in law.  According to
the learned senior counsel, the so-called deficiencies referred
to  in  the  order  dated  10.08.2017  do  not  exist  so  as  to
disqualify the petitioner college/institution, a fact  recorded,
amongst  others  by  the  Oversight  Committee  in  its
communication dated 14.05.2017 as well as by the DGHS as
minuted in the proceedings of 17.01.2017.  Apart therefrom,
the representation of the petitioners dated 19.11.2016 qua
the  deficiencies  pointed  out  by  the  assessors  has  been
disregarded  without  recording  any  reason.   The  learned
senior counsel thus urged that in view of the preponderant
materials on record, negating the existence of the deficiency
relating to faculty and residents in particular, as recorded by
the assessors of the MCI, the decision to debar the petitioner
college/institution from admitting students for the academic
years 2017-18 and 2018-19 and to authorize the MCI  to
encash the bank guarantee of 2 crores is palpably illegal,21
unfair and unjust. Qua the aspect of the proposed inspection
of  the  petitioner  college/institution  on  09.12.2016,  Mr.
Patwalia  has  drawn  our  attention  to  the  communication
dated 14.05.2017 of the Oversight Committee addressed to
the Central Government wherein it observed  that only eight
institutions including the petitioner institution/college   were
attempted  to  be  subjected  to  two  inspections  in  quick
succession for the same purpose, which according to it,  was
not authorized by it.  Mr. Patwalia, thus sought to underline
that the proposed inspection of 09.12.2016 of the petitioner
college/institution, in the attendant facts and circumstances,
was an act of selective victimization, which cannot receive
judicial imprimatur.  
17.As  against  this,  the  learned  senior  counsel  for  the
respondents in unison have urged that in absence of any
legal bar, as noted in the impugned order dated 10.08.2017,
successive  inspections  can  be  conducted  by  the  MCI,  if
warranted.  According  to  them,  the  petitioner
college/institution in not cooperating in the inspection on
09.12.2016  did attempt to withhold the  correct state  of22
affairs,  for  which  it  is  not  entitled  to  any  equitable
consideration. They argued further, that as would be crystal
clear from the materials on record that amongst others, the
deficiency  relating to faculty and residents, was each in
excess of 30%, in terms of the Regulations, the petitioners
are   not  entitled  to  establish  and/or  continue  its
college/institution thereunder and thus the impugned order
is unassailable in law and on facts.
18.The  contrasting  assertions  have  received  our  due
consideration.   The  impugned  order  dated  10.08.2017,  it
cannot  be  gainsaid,  has  to  be  assuredly  tested  on  the
touchstone  of  the  operative  directions  contained  in  this
Court's order dated 01.08.2017 remanding the issue involved
to  the  Central  Government  for  a  fresh  consideration  on
merits after affording opportunity of hearing to the petitioner
college/institution. As  would  be  patent  from  the   order
presently under  scrutiny, the  Hearing  Committee  and  for
that matter, the Central Government had focused only on
two  aspects  namely,  non-cooperation  of  the  petitioner
college/institution in the proposed inspection on 09.12.201623
and  the  subsisting  deficiencies  relating  to  faculty  and
residents, which allegedly is each in excess of 30%.  There is
no  indication  whatsoever  as  to  whether  the  Hearing
Committee/the Central Government had, as directed by this
Court,   re-appraised/reexamined   the   recommendations
views  of  the  MCI,  Hearing  Committee,  DGHS  and  the
Oversight Committee, as available on records. The materials
intended by this Court to be taken note of by the Hearing
Committee/Central Government did include, amongst others
the recommendations of the Oversight Committee contained
in its communication dated 14.05.2017, the observations of
the DGHS  recorded in the proceedings of 17.01.2017 as well
as the representation dated 19.11.2016 submitted by the
petitioner  college/institution  qua  the  deficiencies  allegedly
noticed by the assessors of the MCI during the inspection on
18-19.11.2016.  This assumes importance in view of the fact
that the deficiencies relating to faculty and residents, which
according to the assessors of the MCI each is in excess of
30%, as noted in that inspection had been controverted and
duly  explained   by  the  petitioner  college/institution  with24
supporting materials.  The order dated 10.08.2017 does not
contain a semblance of such consideration.  To state the
least, in view of the eventful backdrop, in which the matter
was remanded to the Central Government for a fresh look on
merits, in our opinion, it was incumbent on it or its Hearing
Committee  to  scrupulously  analyze  all  the  materials  on
record and arrive at a dispassionate decision on the issue.
This  visibly  has  not  been  done.   The  factum  of
non-cooperation of the petitioners in the second inspection
on 09.12.2016 was available before this Court at the time of
passing of the order dated 01.08.2017 and thus could not
have been extended a decisive weightage to conclude against
them.   
19. As  the  impugned  order  dated  10.08.2017  would
reveal,  it  is  apparent  that  for  all  practical  purposes,  the
Hearing Committee/Central Government did not undertake a
dispassionate, objective, cautious and rational analysis of the
materials on record and in our view, returned  wholly casual
findings against the petitioner college/institution.  This order
thus has to be held, not to be in accord with the spirit and25
purport of the order dated 01.08.2017 passed by this Court.
Suffice it to state, the order does not inspire the confidence of
this  Court  to  be  sustained  in  the  attendant  facts  and
circumstances.  
20.In the predominant  factual setting, noted hereinabove,
the approach of the respondents is markedly incompatible
with the essence and import of the proviso to Section 10A(4)
mandating against disapproval by the Central Government of
any scheme for establishment of a college except after giving
the person or the college concerned a reasonable opportunity
of being heard. Reasonable opportunity of hearing which is
synonymous to 'fair hearing', it is not longer  res integra, is
an  important  ingredient  of  audi  alteram  partem  rul e  and
embraces almost every facet of fair procedure.  The rule of
'fair hearing' requires that the affected party should be given
an opportunity to meet the case against him effectively and
the right to fair hearing takes within its fold a just decision
supplemented  by  reasons  and  rationale.  Reasonable
opportunity  of  hearing  or  right  to  'fair  hearing'  casts  a
steadfast  and  sacrosanct  obligation  on  the  adjudicator  to26
ensure fairness in procedure and action, so much so that
any remiss or dereliction in connection therewith would be at
the pain of invalidation of the decision eventually  taken.
Every  executive  authority  empowered  to  take  an
administrative  action  having  the  potential  of  visiting  any
person with civil consequences must take care to ensure that
justice is not only done but also manifestly appears to have
been done.
21.No endeavour whatsoever, in our comprehension, has
been made by the respondents and that too  in the face of an
unequivocal  direction  by  this  Court,  to  fairly  and
consummately  examine the materials on record in details
before recording a final decision  on the issue of confirmation
or  otherwise  of  the  LOP  granted  to  the  petitioner
college/institution as on 12.09.2016.  True it is that the
Regulations do provide for certain norms of infrastructure to
be  complied  with  by  the  applicant  college/institution  for
being qualified for the LOP depending on the stages involved.
This however does not obviate the inalienable necessity of
affording a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the person27
or the college/institution concerned vis-a-vis the  scheme for
establishment of a college before disapproving the same.  The
manner in which the respondents, in the individual facts of
the instant case, have approached the issue, leads to the
inevitable conclusion that the materials on record do not
support determinatively the allegation of deficiency in course
of the process undertaken, as alleged.  We are thus of the
considered opinion that in view of the persistent defaults and
shortcomings  in  the  decision  making  process  of  the
respondents, the petitioner college/institution ought not to
be penalised.   Having regard to the progression of events,
the assertions made by the petitioners in the representations
countering the deficiencies alleged, the observations/views
expressed by the Oversight Committee in its communication
dated  14.05.2017  and  the  DGHS  in  the  hearing  held  on
17.01.2017  negate  the  findings  with  regard  to  the
deficiencies as recorded by the assessors of  the  MCI in  the
inspections  held. Consequently, on an overall view of the
materials  available  on  record  and  balancing  all  relevant
aspects, we are of the considered opinion that the conditional28
LOP  granted  to  the  petitioner  college/institution  on
12.09.2016 for the academic year 2016-17 deserves to be
confirmed.  We order accordingly.  However, as the Act and
Regulations  framed  thereunder  have  been  envisioned  to
attain the highest standards of medical education, we direct
the  Central Government/MCI to cause a fresh inspection  of
the petitioner college/institution to be made in accordance
therewith for the academic year 2018-19 and  lay the report
in respect thereof before this Court within a period of eight
weeks herefrom.  A copy of the report, needless to state,
would be furnished to the petitioner college/institution at the
earliest so as to enable it to avail its remedies, if so advised,
under  the  Act  and  the  Regulations.   The  Central
Government/MCI  would  not  encash  the  bank  guarantee
furnished  by  the  petitioner  college/institution.   For  the
present,  the  impugned  order  dated  10.8.2017  stands
modified to this extent only.    The direction for a writ, order
or  direction  to  the  respondents  to  permit   the  petitioner
college/institution to admit students for the academic year
2017-18, in the facts of the case, is declined.    The Registry29
would  list  the  writ  petition  and  I.A.  No.  73716  of  2017
immediately  after  the  expiry  of  period  of  eight  weeks,  as
above mentioned.

HEMANT GUPTA, J.
1) Leave granted.
2)The order passed by the High Court of Delhi on November 28, 2018
is the subject matter of challenge  in the present appeals, one
preferred by the direct appointee Sub Inspectors (General Duty) of
the Central Reserve Police Force1 and another by the Union of
India. The High Court ordered that the promotee Sub Inspectors
(General  Duty)  will  rank  senior  to  the  direct  appointee  Sub
Inspectors (General Duty) by quashing the order dated October 14,
2013  issued  by  the  Directorate  General  of  the  CRPF  and  the
seniority list dated February 27, 2012.  
1 CRPF
13)The direct recruits were appointed in pursuance of advertisement
published in June, 2007.  The result of the written examination was
declared  on  July  21,  2009.   It  was  on  October  5,  2009,  the
Directorate  General,  CRPF  communicated  to  its  various  units
regarding allotment of 880 candidates to its units. The candidates
were allotted to the units as per vacancies.  The direction was
issued to the Inspector Generals to issue offer of appointment  to
the candidates so allotted. One of the conditions in the said letter
of allotment reads, thus: -
“g) Candidate may be given one-month time to join
CRPF from the date of issue of offer of appointment,
which should not be later than October 30, 2009 and
should be sent by registered post with AD.”
4)It is in pursuance of such allotment, the selected candidates were
issued the letters of offer of appointment.  The offer of appointment
dated October 26, 2009 issued to Bobindra Kumar, appellant No. 1
has been put on record by the respondents.  The appellants have
produced letter of appointment dated October 15, 2009 in respect
of Ravinder Singh, one of the respondents in the High Court.  The
terms and conditions of letter of allotment are the same as are
mentioned in letter of appointment of appellant No. 1.  Some of the
clauses from such letter read as under:
“1.  It is to inform you that as a result of recruitment
test  conducted  by  SSC-2007,  you  have  been
provisionally selected for appointment to the post of
Sub  Inspector  (General  Duty)  in  CRPF  against  the
existing vacancies (normal wastage) of M & N Sector.
2xxxxxx
3 (b).  You shall be at liberty to resign your appointment
before the expiry of first three months of your service
provided  three  months  pay  or  training  charges
whichever is higher is refunded.
xxxxxx
(e).  On joining the department, you will be governed by
CRPF Act-1949 and CRPF Rules-1955 as amended from
time to time.
xxxxxx
(g).  You will be required to undergo basic training as
applicable for the post after reporting at this GC.
(h).  In case you do not report by the stipulated date as
mentioned at Para 4, offer of appointment made to you
will  be  deemed  to  be  lapsed  automatically  and  no
correspondence  whatsoever  on  the  subject  will  be
entertained.
xxxxxx
4.  If you accept the offer of appointment on the terms
and conditions mentioned above, you should report for
duty  in  the  DIGP,  GROUP  CENTRE,  CRPF,  LANGJING
IMPHAL (Manipur) 795113 (T el. No. 0385-2436140) on
or before 26/11/2009 at 0900 Hrs. with the following
docuements….”
5)It is in pursuance of such terms and conditions in the letter of
appointment, the direct recruits reported for training in January,
2010.  On the other hand, the respondents who were  the writ
petitioners  before  the  High  Court  came  to  be  appointed  in
pursuance  of  recruitment  process  initiated  in  June,  2009.   The
result of examination was declared on October 20, 2009.  The
3training commenced on November 23, 2009 as these candidates
were already members of the Force.  
6)After  the  appointments  so  made,  seniority  was  finalised  on
February 27, 2012, whereby the direct recruits were placed senior
to the promotee sub-inspectors.
7)The  promotee  sub-inspectors challenged  the  seniority  
placing the direct recruits senior to the m, inter alia, on the ground
that they were  appointed earlier in point of time to the direct
recruits and, therefore, in terms of Rule 8(e) of the Central Reserve
Police Force Rules, 19552, the promotees should rank senior.  The
High  Court  accepted  the  claim  of  the  promotee  sub-inspectors
relying upon judgment of this Court in Rohitash Kumar & Ors. v.
Om Prakash Sharma & Ors.3 and also Office Memorandum dated
November 4, 1992; and para 11.2(2)(iii)(e) of Chapter XI of the
CRPF Establishment Manual.
8)Aggrieved against the order passed, the direct recruits and the
Union of India are in appeal.
9)Before  we  proceed  further,  Rule  8(e)  needs  to  be  reproduced,
which reads as under:
“8.  Seniority. – (a) The seniority of Superior Officers
shall be in the following order:-
(i)  xxx
xxxxxx
2 Rules
3 (2013) 11 SCC 451
4(e).  A person promoted to a higher rank and a person
recruited  direct  to  the  same  rank  shall  have  their
seniority  from  the date  of appointment  to  that  rank
subject to the condition that if both were appointed on
the same date, the former (promotee) shall be senior:
Provided further that if the date of confirmation is the
same  their  seniority  immediately  before  such
confirmation shall remain unaffected.”
10)Mr. K.M. Nataraj, learned Additional Solicitor General supported the
seniority fixed relying upon the Office Memoranda dated June 24,
1978 and March 4, 2014.  It is argued that the direct recruits are
entitled  to  rank  senior  in  view  of  letter  of  allotment  dated  5th
October  2009  as  against  the  writ  petitioners  who  are  to  be
assigned seniority from the date of announcement of results.  It
was argued that seniority is to be determined according to rotation
of vacancies between the direct recruits and the promotees relying
upon Office Memorandum dated March 4, 2014.  It is further argued
that  Office  Memorandum  dated  November  4,  1992  has  no
applicability for determining of seniority of Sub Inspectors as such
Office Memorandum contemplates that the seniority is delinked
from confirmation.  Such is not the issue in the present case.  The
Standing Order No. 1 of 2009 relied upon by the High Court relates
to fixation of seniority in the cadre of Assistant Commandant in the
CRPF, thus no applicability to the determination of seniority in the
lower rank of sub-inspectors.
511)Mr. Nataraj referred to judgment of this Court in  Amarjit Singh
Ahluwalia (Dr.)  v.  State of Punjab & Ors.4 to contend  that
present  case  is  of  second  kind  of  order  of  appointment  of
appellants as held by th is Court.  Therefore, the date of allotment
of the direct recruits to the units i.e. October 5, 2009 is the date of
appointment in view of the aforesaid judgment.  Learned counsel
referred to the following paragraph from Amarjit Singh , wherein,
this Court held as under:
“10.   …First  let  us  see  what  the  words  “date  of
appointment” mean. Are they synonymous with “date
of the order of appointment”? We think not. An order of
appointment may be of three kinds. It may appoint a
person with effect from the date he assumes charge of
the post or it may appoint him with immediate effect or
it  may  appoint  him  simpliciter  without  saying  as  to
when  the  appointment  shall  take  effect.  Where  the
order  of  appointment  is  of  the  first  kind,  the
appointment would be effective only when the person
appointed assumes charge of the post and that would
be the date of his appointment. It would be then that he
is appointed. But in a case of the second kind, which is
the one with which we are concerned since the order
dated April 8, 1964, appointed Respondents 3 to 19 to
PCMS Class I “with immediate effect”, the appointment
would be effective immediately irrespective as to when
the person appointed assumes charge of the post. The
date of his appointment in such a case would be the
same as the date of the order of appointment...”
12)Mr. Nataraj also relied upon another judgment in Union of India &
Ors. v. N.R. Parmar & Ors.5 to contend that date of appointment
would mean the date of first substantive appointment against the
clear vacancy.  Since the vacancies in the cadre were available
when the direct recruits were allotted to different units, it is the
4 (1975) 3 SCC 503
5 (2012) 13 SCC 340
6date of allotment which has been rightly taken into consideration to
fix the seniority.
13)Mr.  Dhruv  Mehta,  learned  senior counsel  for  the  direct  recruits
submitted  that  date  of  allotment  is  the  date  of  appointment,
therefore,  the  appellants  having  been appointed  on  October  5,
2009 were rightly assigned seniority as against the writ petitioners
who were appointed on October 20, 2009 in terms of Rule 8(e) of
the Rules.  He argued that the Standing Order No. 1 of 2009 cannot
be relied upon to determine seniority of Sub Inspectors as it relates
to Assistant Commandants of the CRPF .  The selection process of
Assistant  Commandants  is  materially  different  from  the  Sub
Inspectors, therefore, such Standing Order could not be taken into
consideration by the High Court to determine the seniority on the
basis of principles laid down in the said Standing Order.  It is also
contended that judgment in Rohitash Kumar relied upon by the
High Court was in respect of seniority of Assistant Commandants in
the Border Security Force where the Rule itself contemplates that in
case of direct entran t, the date of appointment shall be the date of
commencement of their training course.  Therefore, the High Court
was not justified in referring to  Rohitash Kumar when the Rules
applicable to CRPF do not contemplate determination of seniority
from the date of commencement of training.  
 
14)The letter of appointment offered to the Sub Inspectors selected
through limited departmental examination has also been produced
7by  the  appellants.   Such  letter  of  appointment  was  issued  in
November, 2009 and contemplates that the selected candidates
will be required to undergo basic training of 20 weeks and, in case,
they do not report by the stipulated date, the offer of appointment
will be deemed to be lapsed.  Thus, the terms of appointment of
the  direct  recruits  and  that  of  promotee  Sub  Inspectors  are
different. 
15)On the other hand, Mr. Guru Krishnakumar, learned senior counsel
appearing  for  the  respondents/promotees,  argued  that  the
contentions raised by the appellants are factually and legally not
sustainable.  It is argued that date of allotment cannot be treated
to be the date of appointment which is the basis of determination
of seniority in terms of Rule 8(e) of the Rules.  It is argued that
before direct recruit is appointed as a member of the CRPF, he has
to read the statement contain ed in the Recruitment Roll set out in
the Schedule in terms of Section 5 of the Act.  The expression
‘Member of the Force’ is defined in Section 2(d) of the Central
Reserve Police Force Act, 19496 and also Rule 6 of the Rules.  Rule 6
contemplates that all the officers and men mentioned in Rule 5
shall be deemed to be the members of the Force.  Rule 5 has two
categories; first is Superior Officers and second is Rank and File for
a Battalion of four companies.  The Sub Inspector falls within the
second category.  It is contended that a direct recruit does not
become  a  member  of  the  Force  unless  he  takes  an  oath  of
6 Act
8affirmation as per Appendix C set out in Rule 9 of the Rules and
also furnishes Health Certificate in terms of Rule 12. It is pointed
out that the letter of allotment of units dated October 5, 2009 was
the  communication  to  the  Inspector  Generals  of  Police  of  the
various units of CRPF giving names of the selected candidates with
the stipulation that letter of appointment will be issued by them.
Such  letter  was  not  issued  to  any  of  the  direct  recruits.  In
pursuance  of  the  directions  contained,  the  letter  of  offer  of
appointment  was  issued  to  the  Appellants  and  thereafter  on
completion of medical test and other requirements, the training
started in January, 2010 .  It is argued that after taking various
steps  such  as  Health  Certificate,  reporting  for  duty,  oath  of
affirmation as per recruitment rules, the direct recruits became
members of the Force and, therefore, in terms of Rule 8(e) of the
Rules,  their  seniority  is  to  be  determined  from  the  date  of
appointment  which  is  incidentally  close  to  the  date  of  starting
training. Such appointment is after the promotees who commenced
their training.  
16)Some of the relevant conditions from the Act and Rules referred to
by Mr. Guru Krishnakumar read as under:
“The CENTRAL RESERVE POLICE FORCE ACT, 1949  
2(d).  “member of the force”  means a person who
has been appointed to the Force by the Commandant ,
whether before or after the commencement of this Act,
and in section 1,3,6,7,16,17,18, and 19 includes also a
person  appointed  to  the  force  by  the  Central
9Government  whether  before  or  after  such
commencement;
xxxxxx
5.  Enrolment. - Before a person is appointed to be a
member of the force, the statement contained in the
recruiting roll set out in the Schedule shall be read out
and if necessary, explained to him in the presence of an
officer appointed under sub-section (1) of section 4 and
shall be signed by such person in acknowledgement of
its having been so read out to him; 
Provided that any person who has for a period of six
months served with the force shall on appointment to
the force thereafter, be deemed to be a member of the
force  notwithstanding  that  provisions  of  this  section
have not been complied with in his case.
THE CENTRAL RESERVE POLICE FORCE RULES, 1955 
5.  Composition of the Force. –  A. Battalion other
than Signals Battalion 
(1)  The Force shall be constituted as follows:
(a) Superior Officers:
xxxxxx
(b)  Rank and file for a Battalion of four companies…”
xxxxxx
12.   Health  Certificate.  -  No  candidate  shall  be
enrolled unless he obtains a health certificate in the
prescribed  form  CRP-I  signed  by  Medical  Supdt.  and
Staff  Surgeon,  Central  Reserve  Police  Hospital,
Neemuch,  or  by  a  Civil  Surgeon  or  by  a  Recruiting
Medical officer.”
17)Mr. Balasubramanium, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf
of Union of India, submitted that Section 5 relates to enrollment of
Constables  alone  and  the  enrollment  of  Sub  Inspectors  is  not
covered by Section 5 of the Act.
1018)We  do  not  find  any  merit  in  the  arguments  raised  by  learned
counsel for the appellants and Mr. Balasubramanium.  Section 4 of
the Act provides for appointment of superior officers by the Central
Government,  whereas  the  members  of  the  Force  other  than
superior  officers  fall  within  Section  5  alone.   Section  5
contemplates that before a person is appointed to be a member of
the Force, he shall sign the statement contained in the recruitment
roll set out in the Schedule.  Section 5 does not restrict its scope
and  applicability  only  to  the  Constables  and  to  the  persons
appointed by the Commandant.  In terms of Section 2(d) of the Act,
it includes a person who has been appointed by the Commandant
and also a person appointed by the Central Government.  Still
further, Rule 6 contemplates that all officers and men mentioned in
Rule 5 shall be deemed to be the members of the Force.  The Sub
Inspectors  are  part  of  Rank  and  File  for  a  Battalion  of  four
companies.  Therefore, the argument that Section 5 of the Act is
not applicable to the direct recruits is patently untenable.  
19)The  letter  dated  October  5,  2009  is  not  addressed  to  the
appellants- direct recruits.   It is addressed to Inspector General of
Police of the various units of CRPF .  By such communication, the
selected candidates have been allotted to various units to facilitate
issue of letter of appointment by the respective units.  Some of the
appellants were given letter of appointment on October 15, 2009
whereas appellant No. 1 have been given letter of appointment on
October 26, 2009. This is a letter of offer of appointment which is
11required to be accepted by the candidates in terms of clause 4 as
reproduced  above.   The  offer  of  letter  of  appointment  further
contemplates that on joining, they would be governed by the Act
and the Rules, therefore, till such time they join in pursuance of the
offer  of  appointment,  the  appellants  are  not  subject  to  the
provisions of the Act and the Rules.  As per Rule 12 of the Rules, no
candidate shall be enrolled unless he obtains a Health Certificate in
the prescribed form.  The Health Certificate was called upon from
the appellants in the letter of offer of appointment.  Therefore, they
will be deemed to be members of the Force only on furnishing of
Health  Certificate  and  acceptance  of  the  offer  of  appointment
before they proceed for training.
20)The judgment in Rohitash Kumar  relied upon by the High Court is
not  applicable  to  the  members  of  the  CRPF  as  the  date  of
appointment is not the date of commencement of training  in the
Rules.  The  BSF  Rules  are  materially  different  from  the  Rules
applicable to the members of CRPF .  Rule 8(e) of the Rules clearly
stipulates that a person promoted to a higher rank and a person
recruited direct to the same rank shall have their seniority from the
date of appointment .  Therefore, a person appointed by way of
direct recruitment or promotion to the post of Sub Inspector, his
seniority will be fixed as per the date of appointment.  Only in the
case that both direct recruits and promotees are appointed on the
same  date,  promotees  were  to  rank  senior.  Since,  the  date  of
appointment is not 5th October, 2009 but the date they completed
12the formalities after accepting the offer of appointment, their date
of appointment is later than the date of promotion of the promotee
sub-inspectors.
21)The Standing Order No. 1 of 2009 deals with seniority of Assistant
Commandants.  Such Standing Order is in relation to Rule 8(b) of
the Rules.  It may be stated that Rule 8 (a) deals with seniority of
Superior Officers; Rule 8(b) deals with inter se seniority of Superior
Officers; whereas Rule 8(c) deals with seniority of person promoted
to the rank of subordinate or under officer.  It is Rule 8(e) of the
Rules  which is  applicable  in the  present case  where  the  direct
recruits are appointed to the same rank as also by the candidates
by  way  of  limited  competitive  examination.   Therefore,  such
Standing Order could not be relied upon to determine the different
set  of  members  of  the  Force.   We  also  find  that  the  Office
Memorandum dated June 24, 1978 referred to by Mr. Nataraj is not
applicable to the members of the Force as admittedly, there is no
roster for the purpose of recruitment and seniority.  Such Office
Memorandum deals with starting point in the recruitment roster for
the  purpose  of  seniority.   Still  further,  the  Office  Memorandum
dated March 4, 2014 again deals with fixation of seniority where
there is roster of vacancies.  
22)We also find that the second kind of appointment as explained in
Amarjit Singh  has no application in the facts of the present case.
In fact, it is the first kind where a person is appointed with effect
13from the date he assumes charge of the post , would be applicable
in the case in hand.  The offer of appointment was not  with  the
immediate effect but, the candidate was required to convey their
acceptance and also furnishing of medical certificate.  Similarly,
N.R. Parmar is a case of roster and the rules contemplating year
of recruiting.  However, there is no such  pari materia rule which
may make the ratio of the said judgment relevant in the present
case. 
23)The judgment in P . Sudhakar Rao & Ors. v. U. Govinda Rao &
Ors.7 is not applicable in the facts of the present case as in view of
Rule 8(e) of the Rules, the seniority is required to be determined
from the date of appointment alone.  The judgments referred to by
the learned counsel for the parties are not applicable to the issues
raised  in  the  present  appeals  in  view  of  the  fact  that  such
judgments are interpreting different set of rules.  
24)In view of the discussion above, we do not find any merit in the
present set of appeals.  The same are dismissed but for the reasons
other than that which weighed with the High Court.

A.K. SIKRI, J.
All these appeals are filed by the same appellant, namely,
M/s. India Hume Pipe Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the
‘assessee’).  The singular issue that arises is also identical in all
these appeals.  The only reason for filing number of appeals is
that the said issue pertains to different Assessment Years.
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 1 of 192)The issue that has arisen in these appeals is as to whether Works
contract given to the assessee is divisible in nature, in the facts of
the case, and hence the imposition of tax and penalty made
under  Section  7AA of  the  Rajasthan  Sales  Tax  Act,  1954  is
justifiable and sustainable in law.
3)In order to have clarity in the matter and better grasp of the lis, it
is necessary to glance through the relevant facts under which the
aforesaid issue has arisen for consideration.
4)In the year 1954, the State Government of Rajasthan enacted the
Rajasthan Sales Tax Act in order to tax the sales and purchase of
any  goods.   The  assessee  is  a  company  engaged  in
manufacturing and laying of pipelines for water supply schemes.
The  Public  Health  and  Engineering  Department  (for  short,
‘PHED’) of the State Government invited tenders for providing
and  laying  of  pipes  complete  with  suitable  jointing  material
specials,  valves  and  construction  of  valve  chamber,  anchor
blocks  table  crossing,  including  testing  and  commissioning  of
pipelines.  On August 23, 1988, a work order was issued by
PHED in favour of the assessee and the assessee, under the
contracts/agreement dated January 11, 1989, agreed to provide
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 2 of 19PSC pipes manufactured by it and had entered into the contracts
with PHED for providing and laying of pipelines.
5)On  June  28,  1989,  a  notification  inserting  Rule  10B  in  the
Rajasthan Sales Tax Rules, 1955 granting exemption to Works
contract came to be issued with retrospective effect from May 28,
1987.   Another  work  order  was  placed  by  the  respondent  in
favour  of  the  assessee  on  July  10,  1989.   Pursuant  to  this,
another notification dated March 04, 1992 came to be issued by
the  respondent  wherein  it  exempted  tax  on  Works  contract
relating to dams and canals.  The respondent issued another
work order dated August 10, 1992 in favour of the assessee for
commission of pipeline in a dam.  Meanwhile, the assessee filed
an application dated September 17, 1992 before the Commercial
Tax Officer seeking exemption from paying tax.  However, the
same was rejected by the Commercial Tax Officer vide his order
dated September 26, 1994 making it clear to the assessee that
the pipes manufactured and supplied by it fall within the definition
of ‘sale of goods’ and that the contract is divisible in nature.  75%
value of the contract was treated as consideration for sale of
goods.
6)The  appellate  authority, Single  Judge  as  well  as  the  Division
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 3 of 19Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan, after dealing with merits of
the  case,  affirmed  the  order  passed  by  the  Commercial  Tax
Officer  holding  that  the  assessee  is  not  entitled  to  claim
exemption under Section 7AA for supply of pipelines as that was
termed as ‘sale’.
7)We  may  mention  that  the  State  Government  also  issued
notification dated March 29, 2001 wherein laying of pipeline with
material has been categorized as Works contract and because of
this the assessee’s work, after the said notification, is considered
as Works contract and has been granted exemption from that
date.  We are, thus, concerned with the execution of this Works
contract prior to the year 2001.
8)Mr.  Arvind  Datar,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the
assessee, at the outset, drew the attention of this Court to the
decision of the Constitution Bench in the case of Kone Elevator
India Private Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu1.  He laboured to
demonstrate that instant appeals were squarely covered by the
aforesaid judgment wherein it was held that a single, composite
contract for the supply of goods, labour and service will be treated
as a Works contract and that it is not permissible to label a
1 (2014) 7 SCC 1
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 4 of 19contract as a contract of sale of goods or as a Works contract
depending on the proportion the component of supply of goods
bears to the component of supply of labour and service.  Unless
there are clearly two contracts, one for supply of goods and the
second for supply of labour and services, they cannot be treated
separately.
9)Describing the nature of the contract awarded to the assessee,
Mr. Datar emphasized that it was for the manufacture, supply and
commissioning of pipelines for the supply of water to cities and
towns from certain specified dams and the Indira Gandhi Canal
by PHED.  In this composite works contract, the assessee was
inter alia required to:
(i)establish a factory near the working site for manufacturing
pipes of specified dimensions;
(ii)test the pipes;
(iii)undertake civil works like digging of trenches, etc.; 
(iv)lay  the  pipes  with  welding,  jointing,  etc.  and  fill  up  the
trenches; and
(v)sectional testing and commissioning of complete pipeline
and other ancillary works.
In support, he also referred to certain clauses of the work
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 5 of 19order  which,  according  to  him,  amply  demonstrate  that  the
assessee was supposed to undertake civil work extensively.
In addition, relying upon Rule 10B of the 1955 Rules, Mr.
Datar  contended  that  the  assessee  was  entitled  to
characterisation of its contract under the said Rule and once this
exercise is undertaken, it would be apparent that the contract in
question was works contract, which was indivisible in nature.
10)Mr.  Tushar  Mehta,  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General
appearing  for  the  respondents,  countered  the  aforesaid
submissions and maintained that the works contract involved in
this case is rightly held to be divisible in nature.  According to him,
two  types  of  work  orders  had  been  issued  by  the  State
Government.  As per those orders, the work of supply of pipes
and the works for contract of civil work are two different contracts
in which the first part is concerned with sale of pipes on which tax
has been imposed in accordance with the rates applicable to the
pipes,  and  for  which  exemption  certain  cannot  be  issued  as
supply  in  such  cases  falls  within  the  definition  of  ‘sale’.   He
submitted that the assessing authority had examined the work
order in holding that the works contract was divisible and had also
rightly rejected the application for exemption on the ground that
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 6 of 19the sale of pre-stressed cement concrete pipe falls within the
definition of ‘sale of goods’ under the Act.
11)He also argued that the term ‘works contract’ appearing in
Article 366(29A)(b) of the Constitution of India takes within its fold
all  genres  of  works  provide  for  labour  and  services.   For
sustaining levy of tax on goods, deemed to have been sold in
execution of a works contract, the following three conditions must
be fulfilled:
(i)there must be a works contract;
(ii)goods should have been involved in execution of a works
contract; and
(iii)property in those goods must be transferred to a third party
either as goods or in some other form.
Mr. Mehta argued that the works contract executed by the
assessee is a contract which is divisible under work orders and,
thus, the imposition of tax and penalties made under Section 7AA
of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954 is in accordance with law.
12)Mr. Mehta also referred to the terms and conditions of the
agreement and submitted that in the contract substantial part of
the  value  of  the  contract  pertains  to  the  cost  of  PSC  pipes,
jointing material specials, valves etc. which were manufactured
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 7 of 19by the assessee in their factory at Kekri and were supplied to the
State Government.  It was, thus, submitted that the High Court
has  rightly  interpreted  the  contract  and  arrived  at  a  correct
conclusion and on these facts, the judgment of this Court in Kone
Elevator India Private Limited  is not applicable.  Instead he
relied upon the judgment of this Court in the matter of State of
Karnataka and Others v. Pro Lab and Others2 in support of his
submissions.
13)We have given due consideration to the submissions made
by counsel for both the parties.
14)Thrust of the arguments of the counsel for the appellants is
that the contract in question was a single, composite contract for
laying pipelines for supply of water from dams and canals to
certain cities and towns in the State of Rajasthan and it cannot be
treated as divisible contract.  In other words, the submission was
that being a single indivisible contract, it was not permissible for
the State to  extract  divisibility component therein and  impose
sales tax on the purported sale of goods.
15)In the first instance, it may be mentioned that the High
Court has examined the nature of contract in question and has
2 (2015) 8 SCC 557
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 8 of 19come  to the conclusion that as per the terms  and conditions
thereof, substantial part of the value of the contract pertained to
the  cost  of  PSC  pipes,  joining  material  specials,  valves,  etc.
which were manufactured by the assessee in its factory at Kekri
and were not supplied to the State Government.  The High Court,
thus, affirmed the findings of the authorities below on this aspect
and  concluded  that  the  findings  with  regard  to  sale  of  pipes
involved in the works contract are findings of facts which did not
require any interference.
16)We are inclined to agree with the aforesaid approach of the
High Court, namely, when it is found on facts that the works
contract executed by the assessee is a divisible contract, the
argument of the assessee that it is to be treated as one single
and composite contract needs to be rejected on the facts of this
case.  On these facts, we are also of the opinion that  Kone
Elevator India Private Limited  is not applicable.  In that case,
the Court was required to determine whether a particular contract
was works contract for the purposes of Article 366(29A)(b) of the
Constitution.  The Court held that in order to determine such a
question, the enquiry will have to be on the issue as to whether
the contract in question is a composite one for supply of goods,
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 9 of 19labour and service or whether it is not one such single composite
contract but two clearly separate contracts, one for supply of
goods only and the other for supply of labour and services only.
The Court further held that if it is a composite contract, even as
per the constitutional philosophy contained in Article 366(29A), it
is no longer permissible to weigh what proportion the component
of supply of goods bears to the component of supply of labour
and service in the composite contract (whether in terms of the
consideration  payable  or  otherwise),  and  then  depending  on
whether the proportion of supply of goods component is high,
label  it  as  a  ‘contract  for  sale  of  goods’  and  after  the  said
proportion is low then label it as a ‘works contract’.  The Court,
thus, held that if it is a composite contract for supply of goods,
labour and service, then it must be held to be a works contract as
per Article 366(29A)(b) of the Constitution.
17)In the instant case, there is no dispute that the contract in
question was a works contract.  The issue is altogether different,
namely, that of divisibility.  It may be mentioned that before Article
366(29A) of the Constitution was amended with effect from March
01,  1983,  the  test  applicable  was  ‘dominant  nature  test’  or
‘degree of intention’ or ‘overwhelming component test’ or ‘degree
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 10 of 19of labour and service test’.  This Court in  Larsen and Toubro
Limited  and  Another  v.  State  of  Karnataka  and  Another3
clarified that post amendment, i.e. with effect from March 01,
1983, these tests are no longer applicable.  It is also made clear
that the works contract is an indivisible contract, but, by legal
fiction, is divided into two parts, one for the sale of goods and the
other for supply of labour and services.  Affirming the aforesaid
dicta  in  Larsen  and  Toubro  Limited ,  this  Court  in  Kone
Elevator India Private Limited summarised the legal position in
the following manner:
“37.  Having  dealt  with  the  aforesaid  authorities,  as
advised at present, we shall refer to certain authorities
as  to  how  the  term  “works  contract”  has  been
understood  in  the  contextual  perspective  post  the
constitutional amendment. In  Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. ,
the  Court  observed  that  the  distinction  between  a
contract of sale and a works contract is not free from
difficulty and has been the subject-matter of several
judicial decisions. It is further observed that neither
any straitjacket formula can be made available nor can
such quick-witted tests devised as would be infallible,
for it is all a question of determining the intention of
the  parties  by  culling  out  the  same  on  an  overall
reading  of  the  several  terms  and  conditions  of  a
contract.  Thereafter,  the  two-Judge  Bench  set  out
three  categories  of  contracts  and  explained  the
contours, namely, ( i) the contract may be for work to
be done for remuneration and for supply of materials
used in the execution of the work for a price; ( ii) it may
be a contract for work in which the use of the materials
is accessory or incidental to the execution of the work;
and (iii) it may be a contract for supply of goods where
some work is required to be done as incidental to the
sale. Thereafter, it opined that the first contract is a
3 (2014) 1 SCC 708
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 11 of 19composite contract consisting of two contracts, one of
which is for the sale of goods and the other is for work
and labour; the second is clearly a contract for work
and labour not involving sale of goods; and the third is
a  contract  for  sale  where  the  goods  are  sold  as
chattels and the work done is merely incidental to the
sale.
38. Commenting on the said decision in  Larsen and
Toubro,  a  three-Judge  Bench  opined  that  after  the
Forty-sixth Amendment, the thrusts laid down therein
are  not  of  much  help  in  determining  whether  the
contract is a works contract or a contract for sale of
goods. We shall elaborate the perception as has been
stated in Larsen and Toubro at a later stage.
xx               xx               xx
69.  Considered on the touchstone of the aforesaid
two  Constitution  Bench  decisions  in  Builders'
Assn. and Gannon  Dunkerley  (2 ,  we  are  of  the
convinced opinion that the principles stated in  Larsen
and  Toubro as  reproduced  by  us  hereinabove,  do
correctly enunciate the legal position. Therefore, “the
dominant  nature  test”  or  “overwhelming  component
test” or “the degree of labour and service test” are
really not applicable. If the contract is a composite one
which falls under the definition of works contracts as
engrafted under clause (29-A)( b) of Article 366 of the
Constitution, the incidental part as regards labour and
service pales into total insignificance for the purpose
of determining the nature of the contract. ”
18)In  the case  of  Pro  Lab, same  very argument, which  is
advanced in this case, was repelled and in the process judgment
in Kone Elevator India Private Limited was also discussed and
taken note of, in the following manner:
“22.  It was also argued that photograph service can
be  exigible  to  sales  tax  only  when  the  same  is
classifiable as works contract. For being classified as
works  contract  the  transaction  under  consideration
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 12 of 19has  to  be  a  composite  transaction  involving  both
goods  and  services.  If  a  transaction  involves  only
service i.e. work and labour then the same cannot be
treated  as  works  contract.  It  was  contended  that
processing of photography was a contract for service
simpliciter  with  no  elements  of  goods  at  all  and,
therefore,  Entry  25  could  not  be  saved  by  taking
shelter  under  clause  (29-A)  of  Article  366  of  the
Constitution. For this proposition, umbrage under the
judgment in B.C. Kame case  was sought to be taken
wherein this Court held that the work involving taking a
photograph, developing the negative or doing other
photographic work could not be treated as contract for
sale of goods. Our attention was drawn to that portion
of  the  judgment  where  the  Court  held  that  such  a
contract  is  for  use  of  skill  and  labour  by  the
photographer to bring about desired results inasmuch
as a good photograph reveals not only the aesthetic
sense and artistic faculty of the photographer, it also
reflects his skill and labour.
23.  Such an argument also has to be rejected for
more than one reasons. In the first instance, it needs
to be pointed out that the judgment in  Kame case was
rendered  before  the  Forty-sixth  Constitutional
Amendment. Keeping this in mind, the second aspect
which needs to be noted is that the dispute therein
was whether there is a contract of sale of goods or a
contract for service. This matter was examined in the
light  of  law  prevailing  at  that  time,  as  declared
in Dunkerley case  as per which dominant intention of
the contract was to be seen and further that such a
contract  was  treated  as  not  divisible.  It  is  for  this
reason  in BSNL and Larsen  and  Toubro  cases,  this
Court specifically pointed out that  Kame case would
not provide an answer to the issue at hand. On the
contrary,  the  legal  position  stands  settled  by  the
Constitution Bench of this Court in  Kone Elevator India
(P) Ltd. v. State of T.N.  Following observations in that
case are apt for this purpose: (SCC p. 31, para 44)
“44. On  the  basis  of  the  aforesaid
elucidation,  it  has  been  deduced  that  a
transfer of property in goods under clause
(29-A)(b) of Article 366 is deemed to be a
sale of goods involved in the execution of a
works  contract  by  the  person  making  the
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 13 of 19transfer and the purchase of those goods by
the person to whom such transfer is made.
One thing is significant to note that in  Larsen
and Toubro, it has been stated that after the
constitutional  amendment,  the  narrow
meaning given to the term ‘works contract’
in Gannon Dunkerley (1)  no longer survives
at present. It has been observed in the said
case that: (Larsen and Toubro case , SCC p.
750, para 72)
‘72. …  even  if  in  a  contract,  besides  the
obligations of supply of goods and materials
and  performance  of  labour  and  services,
some  additional  obligations  are  imposed,
such contract does not cease to be works
contract, [for] the additional obligations in the
contract  would  not  alter  the  nature  of  the
contract so long as the contract provides for
a contract for works and satisfies the primary
description of works contract.’
It  has  been  further  held  that:  ( Larsen  and  Toubro
case , SCC p. 750, para 72)
‘72. … Once the characteristics or elements
of works contract are satisfied in a contract
then  irrespective  of  additional  obligations,
such contract would be covered by the term
“works contract” [because] nothing in Article
366(29-A)(b) limits the term “works contract”
to contract for labour and service only.’”
 
19)The  history  of  legislative  and  constitutional  amendment
pertaining to works contract is well known, which has been stated
and  restated  by  this  Court  in  number  of  cases.   The  entire
position is summarised in Pro Lab case as well and, therefore, it
is not necessary to burden this judgment by repeating the same.
Purpose would be served by reproducing paragraph 20 of the
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 14 of 19said  judgment  wherein  the  legal  position  is  summarised  as
follows:
“20.  To sum  up,  it follows  from  the  reading  of  the
aforesaid  judgment  in  Larsen  and  Toubro  case that
after  insertion  of  clause  (29-A)  in  Article  366,  the
works  contract  which  was  indivisible  one  by  legal
fiction, altered into a contract, which is permitted to be
bifurcated into two: one for “sale of goods” and the
other for “services”, thereby making goods component
of  the  contract  exigible  to  sales  tax.  Further, while
going  into  this  exercise  of  divisibility,  dominant
intention behind such a contract, namely, whether it
was  for  sale  of  goods  or  for  services,  is  rendered
otiose or immaterial. It follows, as a sequitur, that by
virtue  of  clause  (29-A)  of  Article  366,  the  State
Legislature is now empowered to segregate the goods
part  of  the  works  contract  and  impose  sales  tax
thereupon. It may be noted that Entry 54 of List II of
Schedule VII to the Constitution of India empowers the
State Legislature to enact a law taxing sale of goods.
Sales tax, being a subject-matter of the State List, the
State Legislature has the competency to legislate over
the subject.”
 
20)It clearly follows from the above that by virtue of the Forty
Sixth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution,  a  single  and  indivisible
contract is now brought on par with a contract containing two
separate agreements.  It has also now become a settled position
in law that the State Governments have power to levy sales tax
on value of material in execution of the works contract.  This
position is brought about by creating friction whereby the transfer
of moveable property in a works contract is deemed to be sale,
even though it may not be well within the meaning of Sale of
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 15 of 19Goods Act.  In Larsen and Toubro case it was further held that
the value of goods which can constitute a measure of levy of the
tax has to be the value of goods at the time of incorporation of the
goods in the works even though property in goods passes later.
Taxing  the  sale  of  goods  element  in  a  works  contract  is
permissible even after incorporation of goods, provided tax is
directed to the value of goods at the time of incorporation and
does not purport to tax the transfer of immovable property (refer
to paragraph 124).
21)In  the  present  case,  the  assessing  authority,  after
scrutinising the agreement in question between the assessee and
the State Government, returned a finding of fact that manufacture
and  supply  of  PSC  pipes,  jointing  material  specials,  valves,
anchor blocks, etc. do not fall within the scopes of buildings,
bridges,  dams,  roads  and  canals.   It  was  also  held  that  the
agreement was clearly in two parts, namely, (i) sale and supply of
PSC pipes, jointing material specials, valves, anchor blocks, etc.
and (ii) the remaining part being supply of labour and services.
These findings are upheld not only by the appellate authority but
also by the Single Judge of the High Court as well as the Division
Bench of the High Court.  It may also be mentioned at this stage
Civil Appeal No. 9879 of 2017 & Ors. Page 16 of 19that the assessee has, in fact, admitted that it had no grievance
against the finding that supply of pipes was nothing but the sale
of pipes involved in the execution of the contracts and, therefore,
it was excisable to sales tax.  In view of the findings recorded by
the authorities below, this element of sale of goods shall apply to
jointing  material  specials,  valves,  anchor  blocks,  etc.  as  well.
Thus, we are unable to find any fault with the impugned judgment
of the High Court.
22)These appeals are, accordingly, dismissed with costs.

VERSUS
Hari Shankar Das       ….Respondent(s)

Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.This appeal is filed against the final judgment
and order dated 24.09.2014 passed by the High Court
of Tripura at Agartala in R.S.A. No.42 of 2007 whereby
the High Court allowed the second appeal filed by the
1respondent   herein,   set   aside   the   judgment/decree
dated   24.04.2007   passed   by   the   Additional   District
Judge, West Tripura, Agartala in T.A. No.34 of 2006
and restored the judgment/decree dated 05.04.2006
passed   by   the   Civil   Judge(Junior   Division)   No.2,
Agartala, West Tripura in T.S. No.103 of 2004.
3.A   few   facts   need   mention   hereinbelow   for   the
disposal of this appeal, which involves a short point.
4.The appellant is the plaintiff and the respondent
is the defendant of the civil suit out of which this
appeal arises.
5.The   appellant   filed   a   civil   suit   (T.S.No.103   of
2004)   against   the   respondent   in   the   Court   of   Civil
Judge (Junior Division). The suit was for  declaration
of his right, title and interest in the suit land, for
confirmation of his possession over the suit land and
lastly   for   permanent   injunction.   The   respondent
contested the suit. 
26.The   Trial   Court,   by   judgment/decree   dated
05.04.2006 dismissed the suit. The plaintiff (appellant
herein)   felt   aggrieved   and   filed   first   appeal   (T.A.
No.34/2006)   before   the   Additional   District   Judge,
West   Tripura,   Agartala.   By   judgment   dated
24.04.2007,   the   First   Appellate   Court   allowed   the
appeal and decreed the suit.
7.The defendant (respondent herein) felt aggrieved
and filed second appeal in the High Court of Tripura.
By impugned order, the High Court allowed the appeal
and set aside the judgment of the first Appellate Court
and restored the judgment/decree of the Trial Court
which has given rise to filing of this appeal by way of
special leave to appeal by the plaintiff  in this Court.
8.Heard Ms. Malini Poduval, learned counsel for
the appellant and Mr. Rituraj Biswas, learned counsel
for the respondent.
9.Having heard the learned counsel for the parties
and   on   perusal   of   the   record   of   the   case,   we   are
3constrained to allow the appeal and while setting aside
the   impugned   order,   remand   the   case   to   the   High
Court for rehearing of the second appeal afresh on
merits in accordance with law.
10.The need to remand the case to the High Court
has arisen because on perusal of the impugned order,
we notice that the High Court though admitted the
defendant's second appeal by framing as many as six
substantial   questions   of   law   for   its   hearing   but
practically none of the substantial questions of law
were answered either way by the High Court while
allowing the second appeal by the impugned order. 
11.In other words, though the High Court admitted
the second appeal on six questions but did not answer
any   of   them   on   merits   and   instead   went   into
discussion  on  all other  issues, which  were  not  the
subject matter of the six questions framed and allowed
the second appeal as if it was deciding the first appeal.
412.Section 100 (5) of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (hereinafter referred to as “the Code”), in express
terms, provides that the second appeal shall be heard
only on the substantial question(s) of law framed by
the High Court under Section 100 (4) of the Code.
Therefore, the High Court has to confine its inquiry to
the question(s) framed and not beyond it. 
13.The proviso to sub­section (5) of Section 100 of
the Code also enables the respondent to raise a plea at
the time of hearing that the questions framed either do
not arise in the case or the questions framed are not
the substantial questions of law. At the same time, the
High Court has the jurisdiction to frame any additional
question(s) of law but this the High Court can do by
assigning the reasons.
14.Since  the High  Court  failed to  answer the  six
questions (set out in Para 2 of impugned order) either
way on their respective merits and yet proceeded to
5allow the second appeal, such order, in our view,  is
not legally sustainable and has to be set aside.
15.  In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal
succeeds and is accordingly allowed. The impugned
order is set aside. The case is remanded to the High
Court for deciding the second appeal, out of which this
appeal arises, afresh on its merits in accordance with
law   uninfluenced   by   any   observations   made   in   the
impugned   order   and   in   this   order   because   having
formed an opinion to remand the case, we have not
expressed   any   opinion   on   the   merits   of   the
controversy.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 11020 OF 2018
VASHDEO R BHOJWANI                                 Appellant(s)
                                VERSUS
ABHYUDAYA CO-OPERATIVE BANK LTD & ANR.             Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
R.F. Nariman, J.
1)In the facts of the present case, at the relevant time, a
default of Rs. 6.7 Crores was found as against the respondent No.2.
The respondent No.2 had been declared a NPA by Abhyudaya Co-
operative Bank Limited on 23.12.1999.  Ultimately, a Recovery
Certificate dated 24.12.2001 was issued for this amount.  A Section
7 petition was filed by the Respondent No.1 on 21.07.2017 before
the NCLT claiming that this amount together with interest, which
kept ticking from 1998, was payable to the respondent as the loan
granted to Respondent No.2 had originally been assigned, and,
thanks to a merger with another Cooperative Bank in 2006, the
respondent became a Financial Creditor to whom these moneys were
owed.  A petition under Section 7 was admitted on 05.03.2018 by the
NCLT,  stating  that  as  the  default  continued,  no  period  of
limitation would attach and the petition would, therefore, have to
be admitted.2
2)An appeal filed to the NCLAT resulted in a dismissal on
05.09.2018, stating that since the cause of action in the present
case was continuing no limitation period would attach.  It was
further held that the Recovery Certificate of 2001 plainly shows
that there is a default and that there is no statable defence.  
3)Having heard learned Counsel for both parties, we are of the
view that this is a case covered by our recent judgment in B.K.
Educational  Services  Private  Limited  vs.  Parag  Gupta  and
Associates, 2018 (14) Scale 482, para 27 of which reads as
follows:-
“27.It is thus clear that since the Limitation Act
is applicable to applications filed under Sections 7
and 9 of the Code from the inception of the Code,
Article 137 of the Limitation Act gets attracted.
“The  right  to  sue”,  therefore,  accrues  when  a
default occurs. If the default has occurred over
three years prior to the date of filing of the
application, the application would be barred under
Article 137 of the Limitation Act, save and except
in those cases where, in the facts of the case,
Section 5 of the Limitation Act may be applied to
condone the delay in filing such application.”  
4)In order to get out of the clutches of para 27, it is urged
that Section 23 of the Limitation Act would apply as a result of
which limitation would be saved in the present case.  This
contention is effectively answered by a judgment of three learned
Judges of this Court in Balkrishna Savalram Pujari and Others  vs.
Shree Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan & Others , [1959] Supp. (2)
S.C.R. 476.  In this case, this Court held as follows:
“… …. In dealing with this argument it is necessary
to bear in mind that s.23 refers not to a continuing
right but to a continuing wrong. It is the very
essence of a continuing wrong that it is an act3
which creates a continuing source of injury and
renders the doer of the act responsible and liable
for the continuance of the said injury. If the
wrongful act causes an injury which is complete,
there is no continuing wrong even though the damage
resulting from the act may continue. If, however, a
wrongful act is of such a character that the injury
caused  by  it  itself  continues  then  the  act
constitutes a continuing wrong. In this connection
it is necessary to draw a distinction between the
injury caused by the wrongful act and what may be
described as the effect of the said injury. It is
only  in  regard  to  acts  which  can  be  properly
characterised as continuing wrongs that s.23 can be
invoked. Thus considered it is difficult to hold
that the trustees’ act in denying altogether the
alleged  rights  of  the  Guravs  as  hereditary
worshippers and in claiming and obtaining possession
from them by their suit in 1922 was a continuing
wrong.  The decree obtained by the trustees in the
said  litigation  had  injured  effectively  and
completely  the appellants’ rights though the damage
caused by the said decree subsequently continued...”
(at page 496)
Following this judgment, it is clear that when the Recovery
Certificate dated 24.12.2001 was issued, this Certificate injured
effectively and completely the appellant’s rights as a result of
which limitation would have begun ticking.  
5)This being the case, and the claim in the present suit being
time barred, there is no debt that is due and payable in law.  We
allow the appeal and set aside the orders of the NCLT and NCLAT.
There will be no order as to costs.

Rastogi, J.
1.The   present   batch   of   appeals   are   directed   against   the
judgment and order passed by the Customs, Excise and Service
Tax   Appellate   Tribunal,   at   South   Zonal   Bench,   Chennai
1(hereinafter being referred to as “Tribunal”) rejecting the claim of
the appellant (buyer) for refund of the claim of the central excise
duty   under   Section   11B   of   the   Central   Excise   Act,
1944(hereinafter being referred to as “the Act”) which was paid
under protest by the manufacturer(M/s. Fenner (India) Ltd.).
2.The short point   for consideration in the present batch of
appeals is whether the period of limitation of six months shall
apply where the refund of central excise duty has been claimed
by the buyer and paid by the manufacturer(M/s. Fenner (India)
Ltd.) under protest.
3.With the consent of the parties, we are dealing with the
facts of Civil Appeal No. 7625 of 2005 as all other are analogous
on facts and law.  
4.The appellant is a Public Sector Undertaking engaged in
coal mining.  The price of coal is fixed by the Coal Ministry and
the appellants sell the goods on the price fixed by the Ministry
and no central excise duty is payable on coal.   M/s. Fenner
(India)   Ltd.(manufacturer)   cleared   their   finished   goods   viz.
2feneplsat PVC impregnated conveyor beltings classifying the same
under  sub­heading  3920.12  on  the  Central  Excise  Tariff  Act,
1985 as suggested by the department and paid the duty under
protest.   The dispute with regard to classification of feneplast
PVC   impregnated   conveyor   beltings   came   to   this   Court   and
finally   decided   vide   judgment   dated   28th  March,   1995( M/s.
Fenner (India) Ltd.  Vs. Collector of Central Excise, Madurai
reported in 1995 (Suppl.) 2 SCC 567) holding that the conveyor
beltings would be classifiable under sub­heading 3922.90 for the
period from December 1986 to February 1987 and under sub­
heading no. 3926.90 for the period from 10th  February 1987 to
June,   1987   and   also   for   the   later   period.   Indisputedly,   M/s.
Fenner (India) Ltd. pending classification deposited central excise
duty under protest and had never applied for its refund after the
classification dispute was finally decided by this Court of which a
reference has been made.  
5.The appellant herein is the buyer of conveyor beltings from
M/s. Fenner (India) Ltd. filed application for claim of refund on
20th  December,   1996   for   the   period   20th  July   1988   to   15th
January   1994   on   the   premise   that   the   payment   was   made
3towards   central   excise   duty   by   the   manufacturer(M/s.
Fenner(India)   Pvt.   Limited,   Madurai)   under   protest   due   to
pending   classification   of   PVC   impregnated   conveyor   beltings
dispute in the Court of law and after issue of classification has
been settled by this Court in favour of the manufacturer M/s.
Fenner (India) Ltd. by judgment dated 28th  March, 1995, the
central excise duty collected should be refunded by the excise
department and there is no bar in claiming of refund in terms of
the   amendment   made   under   Section   11B   of   the   Act   and
limitation of six months shall not apply where duty has been paid
under protest.  
6.In furtherance of the application, show cause notice dated
17th February, 1997 was served by the Department holding that
since   the   appellant   did   not   pay   any   duty   and,   therefore,   is
precluded from making any application under Section 11B of the
Act and after affording opportunity of hearing order in original
came   to   be   passed   by   the   Authority   dated   4th  August,   1997
rejecting  the  refund application  filed by the  appellant on  the
ground of limitation and also on unjust enrichment. The appeal
preferred by the appellant against order dated 4th August, 1997
4before the Appellate Authority, Chennai came to be rejected on
the ground of limitation under Order dated 18th  January, 1999
and confirmed by the Appellate Tribunal under order impugned
dated 8th August, 2005 placing reliance on the judgment of this
Court   in  Commissioner   of   Central   Excise,   Mumbai­II   Vs.
Allied Photographics India Ltd.  2004(4) SCC 34.  The subject
matter of challenge is in appeal before us.
7.The main thrust of submission of learned counsel for the
appellant is that since the manufacturer of the conveyor beltings
had paid duty under protest, the restriction of limitation of six
months under 2nd proviso to Section 11B(1) may not apply to the
refund claim filed by the appellant buyer and further submitted
that the only relevant question would be as to whether excise
duty for which refund claim is made has been paid under protest
or not and if the answer is in affirmative, the protest made by the
manufacturer at the time of payment of duty has to be taken into
consideration even to determine whether the buyer has filed the
refund claim within time.  
58.Learned counsel submits that when the duty paid by the
manufacturer   is   permitted   to   be   claimed   by   the   buyer   who
ultimately bears the burden, protest made by such manufacturer
at the time of paying the central excise duty for which the buyer
can also apply for the refund and bar of limitation of six months
may not apply to the buyer claiming refund of excise duty paid by
the manufacturer under protest. 
9.Per   contra,   learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   while
supporting the order of the Tribunal submits that although the
buyer can move an application for refund of central excise duty
under the provision of Section 11B of the Act provided the duty of
excise borne by the buyer had not passed on the incidence of
such duty to any other person and application is submitted for
seeking refund claim within a period of six months from the date
of purchase of the goods which indeed in the instant appeal is
beyond the period of limitation and have been rightly rejected by
the Tribunal placing reliance on the judgment of this Court in
Commissioner   of   Central   Excise,   Mumbai­II   Vs.  Allied
Photographics India Ltd’s case  (supra) and further submitted
that   claim   for   refund   under   Section   11B,   the   right   of   the
6manufacturer and the right of the buyer are separate and distinct
and   indisputedly,   the   application   was   filed   by   the
appellant(buyer) much after the period of six months from the
date of purchase of goods which was time barred in terms of 2nd
proviso to Section 11B(1) of the Act and rightly rejected by the
competent authority and affirmed by the Tribunal and needs no
further interference.
10.Before we proceed to examine the question, it would be
apposite to take note of relevant provision of Section 11B of the
Act applicable at the relevant time(pre­amended) which reads as
under:­
“SECTION 11B. Claim for refund of duty. — 
(1) Any person claiming refund of any duty of excise

Commissioner of Central Excise] before the expiry of
[six months] [from the relevant date] [[in such form and
manner]   as   may   be   prescribed   and   the   application
shall be accompanied by such documentary or other
evidence   (including   the   documents   referred   to   in
section 12A) as the applicant may furnish to establish
that the amount of duty of excise in relation to which
such refund is claimed was collected from, or paid by,
him   and   the   incidence   of   such   duty   had   not   been
passed on by him to any other person :
Provided that where an application for refund has been
made before the commencement of the Central Excises
and   Customs   Laws   (Amendment)   Act,   1991,   such
application shall be deemed to have been made under
this sub­section as amended by the said Act and the
7same   shall   be   dealt   with   in   accordance   with   the
provisions of sub­section (2) substituted by that Act:] 
[Provided further that] the limitation of [six months]
shall not apply where any duty has been paid under

determined by the [Assistant Commissioner of Central
Excise   or   Deputy   Commissioner   of   Central   Excise]
under   the   foregoing   provisions   of   this   sub­section
shall, instead of being credited to the Fund, be paid to
the applicant, if such amount is relatable to –
(a)…..
(b)….

11.It is not disputed that the excise duty was paid by the
manufacturer(M/s.   Fenner   (India)   Ltd.)   under   protest   to   the
department and the dispute with regard to the classification of
the product finally came to be decided by this Court in   M/s.
Fenner India’s case (supra) and the manufacturer M/s. Fenner
(India) Ltd. never moved any application for refund of the excise
duty at any given point of time.  The appellant herein is the buyer
and purchased conveyor beltings from the manufacturer M/s.
Fenner (India)  Ltd. during the period 20th  July, 1988 to 15th
January, 1994 indicated in Civil Appeal No. 7625 of 2005.  The
period for which the refund of excise duty has been claimed
9differs but in all the cases, applications have been filed by the
appellant(buyer) much after the period of limitation which was
six months from the date of purchase of goods at the time of
filing of the application to claim refund under Section 11B of the
Act.
12.Section 11B deals with the claim of refund of duty as paid
on his own accord by any person for refund of such duty to the
competent authority before the expiry of six months from the
relevant date as prescribed but where the duty was paid under
protest in terms of the 2nd proviso to Section 11B(1), the period of
limitation may not apply. Although the buyer can also apply for
refund provided the duty of excise is borne by the buyer and he
had not passed on the incidence of such duty to any other person
as referred to under Section 11B(2)(e) and the application has
been moved within the period of six months from the relevant
date of purchase of the goods by such person in terms of Section
11B(5)(B)(e) of the Act.   The scheme of Section 11B makes a
distinction between right of the manufacturer to claim refund
from right of the buyer to claim refund treating them separate
and distinct for making an application for refund exercising their
10right under Section 11B of the Act and it has been examined by
the   three­Judge   Bench   of   this   Court   in   Commissioner   of
Central   Excise,   Mumbai­II   Vs.  Allied   Photographics   India
Ltd. case(supra) as under:­
“Therefore,   Section   11­B(3)   stated   that   no   refund
shall   be   made   except   in   terms   of   Section   11­B(2).
Section 11­B(2)( e ) conferred a right on the buyer to
claim refund in cases where he proved that he had not
passed on the duty to any other person.   The entire
scheme of Section 11­B showed the difference between
the rights of a manufacturer to claim refund and the
right of the buyer to claim refund as separate and
distinct.   Moreover, under Section 4 of the said Act,
every   payment   by   the   manufacturer   whether   under
protest or under provisional assessment was on his
own account.   The accounts of the manufacturer are
different   from   the   accounts   of   a   buyer(distributor).
Consequently,   there   is   no   merit   in   the   argument
advanced   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   the
distributor was entitled to claim refund of “on­account”
payment   made   under   protest   by   the   manufacturer
without complying with Section 11­B of the Act.”
 
It was further held as under:­
“Having come to the conclusion that the respondent
was bound to comply with Section 11B of the Act and
having   come   to   the   conclusion   that   the   refund
application dated 11­2­1997 was time­barred in terms
of Section 11B of the Act, we are not required to go into
the merits of the claim for refund by the respondent
who has alleged that it has not passed on the burden
of duty to its dealers.”
13.It   may   be   appropriate   to   notice   that   the   view   earlier
expressed by the two­Judge Bench of this Court in   National
Winder  Vs.  Commissioner   of   Central   Excise,   Allahabad
112003(11) SCC 361 was held to be  per incuriam in Commissioner
of Central Excise, Mumbai­II  Vs. Allied Photographics India
Ltd. case(supra).
14.In the instant case, indisputedly the application was filed by
the appellant as a buyer of the goods(conveyor belts) from M/s.
Fenner (India) Ltd. who paid the duty under protest much after a
period of limitation(six months) as prescribed under the mandate
of law disentitles the claim of refund to the appellant as prayed
for in view of the judgment of this Court in   Commissoiner of
Central   Excise,   Mumbai­II   Vs.  Allied   Photographics   India
Ltd. case(supra) holding that the purchaser of the goods was not
entitled   to   claim   refund   of   duty   made   under   protest   by   the
manufacturer without complying the mandate of Section 11B of
the Act, 1944.
15. In our considered view, the appeals are without substance
and deserve to be rejected.   Consequently, the appeals fail and
are accordingly dismissed.

Leave granted.
2.These appeals are against the judgment and order dated
05.04.2016 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at
Chandigarh relating to the claims for compensation in respect of
injuries sustained by two gratuitous passengers in a jeep (goods
vehicle).  The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (for short “Tribunal”)
had dismissed the claim petitions on the ground that the negligence
of   the   driver   was   not   proved.     However,   the   High   Court,   after
holding that the accident was as a result of composite negligence of2
the driver of the jeep and the other offending vehicle, held that the
owner   and   driver   of   the   jeep   would   be   liable   for   payment   of
compensation and exonerated the insurer of the jeep, on the ground
that the vehicle was insured as a goods vehicle and the claimants,
who   had   sustained   injuries,   were   gratuitous   passengers   in   the
goods   vehicle   (Jeep)   and  would  thus  not   be   covered  under  the
insurance policy as they were not travelling as owner of the goods.
The insurance of the jeep, as a goods vehicle, has been found to be
valid.  
3.In F.A.O. No. 5460 of 2012 before the High Court, the
case was of one Anu Bhanvara, aged about fifteen years at the time
of the accident, who, because of injuries sustained, had to have
amputation   of   wrist   resulting   in   55%   disability.     The   Tribunal
assessed   total   compensation   of   Rs.5,26,000/­,   which   was   after
assessing disability compensation of 55% at Rs.50,000/­, loss of
prospect of marriage at Rs.1,00,000/­ and cost of artificial limb at
Rs.3,76,000/­.     The   High   Court  enhanced   the   compensation   to
Rs.6,41,750/­, after awarding additional compensation for medical
expenses, pain and suffering, income loss etc. in addition to what
was assessed by the Tribunal. 3
4.In the other F.A.O. No. 5461 of 2012 before the High
Court, the case was of one Rohit Kumar, aged about eighteen years
at the time of accident, who, because of the injuries sustained in
the   accident,   had   to   have   his   arm   amputated   below   the  elbow
resulting   in   70%   disability.     The   Tribunal   assessed   total
compensation   of   Rs.5,78,000/­,   which   was   after   assessing   the
disability compensation of 70% at Rs.50,000/­, income assessed at
Rs.54,000/­ and cost of artificial limb at Rs.3,90,000/­.  The High
Court enhanced the compensation to Rs.7,36,000/­, after awarding
additional compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering,
income loss etc. in addition to what was assessed by the Tribunal.
5.Challenging the said judgments of the High Court, these
appeals   have   been   filed   by   the   claimants   for   enhancement   of
compensation and also to direct payment of compensation by the
insurer.  
6.We have heard Mr. S. L. Gupta, learned counsel for the
appellants and Ms. Shanta Devi Raman, learned counsel for the
respondent no.1­insurer and have perused the material on record. 
7.The questions now to be considered by this Court are
two­fold; firstly, whether the amount of compensation awarded was
adequate   or   not;   and   secondly,   whether   the   payment   of4
compensation is to be made jointly by the owner and driver of the
vehicle, or by the insurer which could thereafter be recovered by the
insurer from the owner and driver.  
8.Having regard to the respective age of the two claimants
and keeping in view that compensation has been awarded on all
requisite heads by the High Court, we are of the opinion that no
interference is called with regard to the quantum of compensation
awarded to the two claimants.  
9.The next question is as to which of the respondents, that
is the owner and driver, or the insurer of the vehicle, would be
liable for payment of such compensation.  As regard the liability for
payment of compensation, it has been contended by the learned
counsel for the appellants that since the vehicle was admittedly
insured with the respondent no.1­insurance company, the principle
of pay and recover would be invoked even in case of a gratuitous
passenger in a goods vehicle. The insurance company should thus
be made liable for the payment of compensation to the appellants
and in turn they would have the right to realise/recover the same
from   the   owner   and   driver   of   the   vehicle.     In   support   of   his
submission, learned counsel for the appellants has relied on the
following   decisions   of   this   Court,   namely,   Manuara   Khatoon   v.5
Rajesh Kumar Singh (2017) 4 SCC 796, Puttappa v. Rama Naik (Civil
Appeal No.4397 of 2016, disposed of on 2nd  April, 2018); Manager,
National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Saju P. Paul (2013) 2 SCC 41; New
India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Vimal Devi (Civil Appeal Nos.1578­1579
of 2004, disposed of on 5th  October, 2010); National Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. Challs Upendra Rao (2004) 8 SCC 517; New India Assurance
Co.   Ltd.   v.   C.   M.   Jaya   (2002)   2   SCC   278;   Amrit   Lal   Sood   v.
Kaushalya Devi Thapar (1998) 3 SCC 744. 
10.Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent­insurance
company has contended that since the claimants were gratuitous
passengers   in   a   goods   vehicle,   in   which   case   the   liability   for
payment   of   compensation   for   death   or   body   injury   to   the
passengers of such goods vehicle would not be covered,  hence the
principle of pay and recover would not apply.   It has thus been
contended that the order of the High Court is perfectly justified in
law and calls for no interference by this Court.  In support of her
submission,   learned   counsel   has   relied   on   following   decisions,
namely, New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Asha Rani (2003) 2 SCC
223; National Insurance  Co. Ltd. v. Baljit  Kaur (2004) 2 SCC  1;
National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Kaushalya Devi (2008) 8 SCC 246;6
National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rattani (2009) 2 SCC 75; National
Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Prema Devi (2008) 5 SCC 403; Bharat AXA
General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Adani MANU/TN/6503/2018;   Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Lal Singh (2015) SCC Online
Del 7508.
11.We   have   heard   learned   counsel   for   the   parties   and
perused the record as well as the various decisions cited by learned
counsel for the parties.  The insurance of the vehicle, though as a
goods vehicle, is not disputed by the parties.  The claimants in the
present   case   are   young   children   who   have   suffered   permanent
disability   on   account   of   the   injuries   sustained   in   the   accident.
Thus, keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this
case, we are of the considered view that the principle of “pay and
recover” should be directed to be invoked in the present case.
12.Accordingly,   these   appeals   are   disposed   of   with   the
direction that the respondent no.1 – insurance company shall be
liable to pay the awarded compensation to the claimants in both the
appeals.  However,  respondent   no.1   –   insurance   company   shall
have the right to realize the said amount of compensation from the7
respondents   no.   2   and   3   (driver   and   owner   of   the   vehicle)   in
accordance with law.
13.There shall be no order as to costs.

(Arising out of S.L.P.(c) No. 27775 of 2017)
Apollo Zipper India Limited            ….Appellant(s)
VERSUS
W. Newman And Co. Ltd.    ….Respondent(s)
                 
J U D G M E N T
Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.This  appeal  is  directed  against  the  final
judgment and decree dated 13.06.2017 passed by
the High Court at Calcutta in APD No. 510 of 2015
whereby  the  Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court
allowed the appeal filed by the respondent herein2and set aside the order dated 14.10.2015 passed by
the  Single  Judge  of the  High  Court  and  granted
unconditional leave to the respondent to defend the
suit and remanded the suit for its trial on merits. 
3.The short issue involved in this appeal relates
to grant of leave to the respondent (defendant) to
defend  the  summary  eviction  suit  filed  by  the
appellant  against  them  in  relation  to  the  suit
premises.
4.  In order to appreciate the issue involved, it is
necessary to set out the background facts which led
to  filing of  the  summary eviction  suit  leading  to
passing of the impugned order. 
5. The  background  facts  of  the  case  are  as
follows:
6.The  appellant  is  the  plaintiff  whereas  the
respondent is the defendant in a summary suit out
of which this appeal arises.37.There is a Hotel in the city of Kolkata called
“Great  Eastern  Hotel”  (hereinafter  referred  to  as
“GEH”). It is situated in Old Court House Street
(Hemanta  Basu  Sarani),  Kolkata.  The  Hotel  has
been in existence for the last more than a century.
It is a heritage Hotel. The Hotel building has several
floors  and  consists  of  several  shops,  business
premises including the Hotel.  The building and the
Hotel was owned and run by the Company called
“Great Eastern Hotel Limited” (hereinafter referred
to as “GEHL” ).
8.The shops and business premises in the Hotel
building are mostly on the ground floor and were let
out by GEHL to different persons as their tenants.
One  such  business  premises  (No.18)  measuring
around 6000 sq. feet, which is the subject matter of
this  appeal  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “suit4premises”), was let out by GEHL, a century back, to
the  respondent  for  non-residential  purpose.  The
monthly rent of the suit premises at the relevant
time was Rs.40,000/-.  
9.In the year  1975, the State  of West Bengal
passed  an  Act  called  “The  Great  Eastern  Hotel
(Taking Over of Management) Act, 1975 (Act XXXII
of 1975)” (hereinafter referred to as “the Act 1975”).
The Act 1975 was passed to provide for taking over
of the management of the undertaking of the GEHL
as defined under Section 2(d) for a limited period of
five years in public interest and also to secure its
proper  management.  Pursuant  thereto,  the  State
Government  took  over  the  management  of  the
undertaking of the GEHL. 
10.The Act of 1975 was followed by another Act
passed by the State of West Bengal on the expiry of
five years in 1980 called “The Great Eastern Hotel5(Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1980 (Act No XXVII
of 1980)”  (hereinafter referred to as “the Act 1980”).
The Act 1980 was passed for the acquisition of the
undertaking of the GEHL. 
11.On 18.06.1981, the State Government issued a
notification  under  Section  3(1)  of  the  Act  1980
whereby the undertaking of GEHL stood transferred
to and vested absolutely in the State Government
with effect from 17.07.1980.
12.The  Governor  issued  a  notification  under
Section 3 (2) of the Act 1980 for better and efficient
management and administration of the GEH, and
directed therein that the undertaking of the GEHL
shall  stand  transferred to  and  vest in  the  Great
Eastern  Hotel  Authority  (for  short,  “GEHA”)
constituted under Section 5 (1) of the Act 1980. 
13.Consequent upon enacting of the Act 1980 and
issuance of the aforementioned notification under6the  Act  of  1980,  the  State  Government  (GEHA)
became the owner of the GEHL (which included the
land, Hotel building, assets and the management of
GEHL) by operation of law. 
14.As a consequence thereof, the respondent, who
was  originally  the  tenant  of  GEHL,  became  the
tenant of the State Government, i.e., GEHA on the
same  terms  and  conditions  with  effect  from
17.07.1980.  The  respondent  too  accepted  this
transfer  of  ownership  of  the  suit  premises  and
accordingly  started  paying  monthly  rent  of
Rs.40,000/- to GEHA which they  paid till 2005.
15.On 05.10.2005, the Governor issued another
notification under Section 3(2) of the Act 1980 and
directed therein that all the fixed and current assets
of  the  GEHA  be  vested  in  the  Company  called
""Apollo Zipper India Limited"" (appellant herein). 716.As a result of issuance of this notification, all
the assets (fixed and current) of GEHA stood vested
in  the  appellant-Company  with  effect  from
05.10.2005. This is how the appellant became the
absolute owner of GEHA including the suit premises
let out to the respondent. 
17.By  letter  dated  24.02.2006,  GEHA  informed
the respondent about the transfer of their  entire
assets to the appellant with effect from 05.10.2005
followed by another letter dated 28.04.2006 of the
Advocates  of  GEHA  sent  to  the  respondent
informing them about the transfer of ownership and
assets of GEHA to the appellant with effect from
05.10.2005 including transfer of the suit premises
to the appellant.
18.On 17.05.2012, the appellant sent  a  quit
notice to the respondent under Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882(hereinafter referred8to as “the TP Act”) and terminated the respondent's
tenancy with effect from 03.06.2012 and demanded
arrears  of  rent  and  vacant  possession  of  the
tenanted premises from the respondent. On receipt
of the quit notice, the respondent did not reply to it.
(See page180 of SLP- order of the Single Judge).
19.This led to filing of the summary suit being
Civil Suit No.201/2012 by the appellant against the
respondent on the original side of the High Court at
Calcutta  claiming  therein  arrears  of  rent
(Rs.39,20,000/-), the vacant possession of the suit
premises  and  mesne  profits  at  the  rate  of
Rs.40,000/- per day. 
20.The suit was filed under Chapter XIII- A (Rule
1-B) of  the  Rules of  the  High  Court  at  Calcutta
(original side), 1914 (for short, “The  Rules”). The
appellant  filed  evidence  by  way  of  affidavit  in
support  of  their  case.  The  respondent  on  being9served of the summons of the suit also filed affidavit
opposing the suit of the appellant. 
21.It may be mentioned here that the appellant
filed  another  Civil  Suit  No.53/2007  against  the
respondent  in  the  High  Court  at  Calcutta  for
permanent  injunction  restraining  them  from
carrying  out  any  changes  in  the  nature  and
character of the suit premises and from transferring
and alienating the suit premises to any third party. 
22.Similarly, the respondent also filed one suit
(Title Suit No.1183/2012) in the City Civil Court at
Calcutta against the appellant for a declaration that
the  quit  notice  dated  17.05.2012  sent  by  the
appellant to the respondent under Section 106 of
the TP Act is void, that the respondent is a monthly
tenant of the suit premises, and also prayed for
issuance  of  mandatory  injunction  against  the
appellant, who was made defendant No.1 in the said10suit, and Bharat Hotels Ltd., GEHA and the State of
West  Bengal  as  defendant  Nos.  2,  3  and  4
respectively, directing them to accept the monthly
rent  from  the  respondent(plaintiff)  at  the  rate  of
Rs.1600/- in respect of the tenanted premises. This
suit is pending.
23.The  respondent  also  filed  Writ  Petition
No.569/2004  in  the  High  Court  at  Calcutta
challenging therein the rate of monthly rent of the
suit premises.
24.Coming now to the facts of the summary suit
filed by the appellant (C.S. No.201 of 2012) out of
which  this  appeal  arises,  the  appellant  (plaintiff)
claimed  that  they  are  entitled  to  a  decree  for
eviction  against  the  respondent  from  the  suit
premises and also a decree for arrears of rent and
mesne profits  under Rule 6 of the Rules because the
respondent  has  failed  to  raise  any  arguable  and11substantial defense on merits in support of their
case in answer to the appellant's summary suit.
25.The  respondent,  however,  raised  essentially
three grounds to oppose the appellant's suit by way
of defense and sought leave to defend the suit on
the said grounds.
26. First, the suit, as filed by the appellant by
taking recourse to the provisions of the TP Act, is
not maintainable. According to the respondent, the
suit should have been filed under the West Bengal
Premises  Tenancy  Act,  1997  (for  short,   “the
Tenancy Act”) because the monthly rent of the suit
premises  is  less  than  the  limit  prescribed  under
Section  3(f)  of  the  Tenancy  Act  (monthly  rent  is
Rs.1600/-  whereas  the  limit  prescribed  is
Rs.10,000/-.)
27.Second, the respondent has not attorned to
the appellant inasmuch as it is also not clear as to12who  is  the  owner  of  the  suit  premises,  viz.,  the
appellant-Company or Bharat Hotels limited and,
therefore, the appellant is required to prove their
title over the suit premises. It is more so for want of
any  attornment  made  by  the  respondent  of  the
appellant's ownership and the tenancy in question.
This,  according  to  the  respondent,  needs  an
elaborate trial in the suit.
28.Third, the monthly rent of the suit premises is
Rs.1600/-  whereas  the  respondent  is  paying
Rs.38,400/-  towards  maintenance  charges to  the
landlord.  It was  contended  that  since  there  is  a
dispute  as  to  whether  the  monthly  rent  is
Rs.40,000/- or Rs.1600/-, the same also needs an
elaborate trial on merits in the suit.
29.   The Single Judge, by order dated 14.10.2015,
declined to grant leave to defend to the respondent
and  decreed  the  appellant's  suit  by  passing  an13eviction decree against the respondent in relation to
the suit premises.  The Single Judge held that none
of the grounds raised by the respondent to seek
leave to defend the suit are prima facie arguable and
nor  have  any  merit  and  nor  these  grounds
constitute  any  substantial  defense,  which  may
require  an  elaborate  trial  on  such  grounds  and,
therefore, no case is made out to grant any leave to
defend the suit to the respondent. 
30.In other words, the Single Judge held, that the
summary suit is maintainable under the provisions
of the TP Act, that the monthly rent of the suit
premises is Rs.40,000/-, that the respondent has
attorned to the appellant, that the appellant has
prima facie proved their title over the suit premises,
that  the  provisions  of  the  Tenancy  Act  has  no
application because the monthly rent of the  suit
premises  is  above  the  prescribed  limit  of14Rs.10,000/- and lastly, to record these findings, no
elaborate trial in the suit is required inasmuch as
such findings can be recorded on the basis of the
documents filed by the parties. 
31.The respondent felt aggrieved and filed appeal
before the Division Bench of the High Court. By
impugned judgment, the Division Bench allowed the
respondent's  appeal,  set  aside  the  order  of  the
Single  Judge  and  granted  unconditional  leave  to
defend the suit to the respondent and remanded the
suit for its trial on merits. 
32.The Division Bench was of the view that there
is  some  dispute  regarding  the  title  over  the  suit
premises  as  to  who  is  the  owner  of  the  suit
premises, namely, whether the appellant-Company
or the other Company,i.e., M/s Bharat Hotels Ltd. 
33.In other words, the Division Bench held that
the question of title over the suit premises needs to15be gone into detail in the suit with a view to find out
as to who is the actual owner of the suit premises
and hence an arguable case in defense has been
made out by the respondent while seeking leave to
defend the summary suit.
34.The plaintiff (appellant) felt aggrieved and filed
this  appeal  by  way  of  special  leave  against  the
judgment of the Division Bench in this Court.
35.Heard  Mr.  Mukul  Rohtagi  and  Mr.  Ranjeet
Kumar, learned senior counsel for the appellant and
Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel for the
respondent. 
36.Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for
the appellant (plaintiff) while assailing the legality
and correctness of the impugned judgment, mainly
reiterated the same submissions, which were urged
by the appellant before  the two Courts below  in
support of their case. 1637.In  substance,  his  submission  was  that  the
reasoning  and  the  conclusion  arrived  at  by  the
Single Judge is just, proper and legal and hence the
order of the Single Judge deserves to be restored by
setting aside the impugned judgment. 
38.Learned counsel urged that none of the three
grounds raised by the respondent for grant of leave
to defend the suit were either arguable or had any
prima  facie merit  therein.  In  other  words,  the
submission  was  that  all  the  three  grounds  were
raised for the sake of raising having no arguable
and substantial defense whether on facts or in law
and,  therefore,  Single  Judge  was  justified  in
declining to grant leave to defend the suit to the
respondent and was justified in passing decree for
eviction against the respondent. 
39.On merits, learned counsel pointed out with
reference to each ground that the documents on17record  would  prima  facie show  that  firstly,  the
monthly  rent  was  Rs.40,000/-,  Secondly,  the
appellant  was  the  owner  of  the  suit  premises,
thirdly, the  respondent  had duly attorned to the
appellant and fourthly, the suit was rightly filed by
invoking the provisions of the TP Act because the
provisions of the Tenancy Act had no application to
the suit premises due to monthly rent of the suit
premises exceeding the limit specified under Section
3 (f) of the Tenancy Act.
40.In  reply,  Mr.  Jaideep  Gupta,  learned  senior
counsel for the respondent supported the impugned
judgment and contended that no case is made out
to  interfere  in  the  impugned  judgment.  Learned
counsel then elaborated his submission in support
of the impugned judgment and prayed for dismissal
of the appeal.1841.Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are  inclined  to  allow  the  appeal,  set  aside  the
impugned judgment and restore the order of the
Single Judge.
42.In our considered opinion, the reasoning and
the conclusion arrived at by the Single Judge while
declining to grant leave to defend the suit to the
respondent and decreeing the appellant's suit for
eviction  deserves  to  be  restored  as  against  the
impugned judgment passed by the Division Bench.
43.In  other  words,  we  are  of  the  considered
opinion that the grounds, which were pressed in
service by the respondent, to seek leave to defend
the suit are neither arguable nor have any  prima
facie merit therein and, therefore, there does not
arise any need to have any trial in the suit on merits19on  such  grounds.  This  we  say  for  the  following
reasons. 
44.The first question that arises for consideration
in this appeal is whether the respondent attorned to
the appellant or whether the appellant is required to
prove their title over the suit premises or whether
there exists any doubt or confusion over the issue of
title of the suit premises so as to grant leave to
defend to the respondent to probe these questions
elaborately on merits in the summary suit filed by
the appellant against the respondent for eviction.
45.   It is a settled principle of law laid down by
this  Court  that  in  an  eviction  suit  filed  by  the
landlord against the tenant under the Rent Laws,
when the issue of title over the tenanted premises is
raised, the landlord is not expected to prove his title
like what he is required to prove in a title suit. 2046.In  other  words,  the  burden  of  proving  the
ownership in an eviction suit is not the same like a
title suit. (See  Sheela & Ors. vs. Firm Prahlad Rai
Prem Prakash , 2002 (3) SCC 375, Para 10 at page
383 and also Boorugu Mahadev & Sons & Anr. vs.
Sirigiri Narasing Rao & Ors.  2016 (3) SCC 343,
Para 18 at page 349 ).
47.Similarly, the law relating to derivative title to
the  landlord  and  when  the  tenant  challenges  it
during subsistence of his tenancy in relation to the
demised property is also fairly well settled. Though
by virtue of Section 116 of the Evidence Act, the
tenant is estopped from challenging the title of his
landlord, yet the tenant is entitled to challenge the
derivative title of an assignee of the original landlord
of the demised property in an action brought by the
assignee against the tenant for his eviction under
the Rent laws. However, this right of a tenant is21subject  to  one  caveat  that  the  tenant  has  not
attorned to the assignee. If the tenant pays rent to
the assignee or otherwise accepts the assignee's title
over  the  demised  property,  then  it  results  in
creation of the attornment which, in turn, deprives
the tenant to challenge the derivative title of the
landlord.  [See  Bismillah  De  (dead)  by  Legal
Representatives vs. Majeed Shah.  2017 (2) SCC
274 Para 24] 
48.It  is  equally  well-settled  law  with  regard  to
attornment that it does not create any new tenancy
but once the factum of attornment is proved then by
virtue  of  such  attornment,  the  old  tenancy
continues.  (See  Uppalapati  Veera  Venkata
Satyanarayanaraju  &  Anr.  Vs.  Josyula
Hanumayamma & Anr.  AIR 1967 SC 174 ).
49.In the case at hand, we find that it is not in
dispute that the original owner of the suit premises22was GEHL, who had created the original contract of
tenancy with the respondent in relation to the suit
premises. 
50.It is also not in dispute that the GEHL was
then acquired by the State by Act of 1975 and the
Act  of  1980,  as  a  consequence  thereof,  the  suit
premises stood  vested  in  an  authority  called the
GEHA by operation of law as per Section 3 read with
Section  5  of  the  Act  1980  with  effect  from
17.07.1980 and 22.06.1981. 
51.It is also not in dispute that the respondent
accepted this change of ownership and accordingly
started paying monthly rent to the GEHA from 1980
as monthly tenant of the GEHA and which they paid
till 2005. 
52.It is also not in dispute that in terms of the
notification issued by the Governor on 05.10.2005
under  Section  3(2)  of  the  Act  of  1980,  the  suit23premises then stood transferred and vested in the
appellant-Company  (see  notification  dated
05.10.2005) by operation of law and the appellant
accordingly became the owner of the suit premises
with effect from 05.10.2005.
53.It is further not in dispute that the GEHA and
their  lawyer,  vide  letters  dated  24.02.2006  and
28.04.2006,  informed  the  respondent  about  the
change of ownership of the suit premises and the
appellant  acquiring  the  ownership  of  the  suit
premises vide notification dated 05.10.2005.
54.In our considered opinion, the aforementioned
undisputed facts, which are matter of record, are
sufficient  to  hold  in  the  eviction  suit  that  the
appellant became the owner of the suit premises
with effect from 05.10.2005. 
55.In our considered view, the respondent also
attorned  to  the  appellant  and  accepted  the24ownership of the appellant over the suit premises,
which is  prima facie proved by the three facts and
circumstances as set out below. 
56. First, when the appellant sent a quit notice
dated 17.05.2012 to the respondent under Section
106  of  the  TP  Act  determining  the  tenancy  and
calling upon the respondent to pay the arrears of
rent and vacate the suit premises, despite receipt of
the quit notice, they did not reply to it. 
57.In  our  view,  the  respondent  ought  to  have
replied  to  the  notice  at  the  first  available
opportunity, which they failed to do so. It amounts
to waiver on their part to challenge the invalidity or
infirmity of the quit notice including the ownership
issue raised therein.
58.In the case of  Parwati Bai  vs. Radhika, AIR
2003 SC 3995, the question arose as to whether the
tenancy  was  terminated  in  accordance  with  the25provisions  of  Section  106  of  the  TP  Act.  The
defendant  despite  receiving  the  notice  from  the
plaintiff did not reply to it. 
59.This Court held that if the defendant does not
raise any objection to the validity of quit notice at
the first available opportunity, the objection will be
deemed to have been waived. The following Para 6 of
the decision is apposite which reads as under:
“6. The singular question to be examined in
the present case is whether the tenancy was
terminated in accordance with the provisions
of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property
Act. The receipt of notice by the defendant is
admitted  in  the  written  statement.  The
defendant  has  not  raised  any  specific
objection as to the validity of the notice. An
objection  as  to  invalidity  or  infirmity  of
notice  under  Section  106  of  the  TP  Act
should  be  raised  specifically  and  at  the
earliest; else it will be deemed to have been
waived even if there exists one. It cannot,
therefore,  be  said  that  the  notice  in  the
present case suffered from any infirmity. A
copy of the notice was exhibited and proved
by the plaintiff as Ext. P-4.”
     2660. Second,  the  respondent  by  letters  dated
13.06.2006,  27.06.2006,  05.07.2006  and
11.07.2006, sent to the appellant on the question of
ownership of the suit premises and payment of rent
had  expressed  their  willingness  to  attorn  and
continue the tenancy with the appellant and also
offered to pay rent to the appellant. (See pages 198
& 199 of the SLP Paper Book-order of the Single
Judge)
61.Third,  the  respondent  in  their  civil  suit
(No.1183  of  2012)  filed  against  the  appellant  in
Paras 15, 17, 18 and relief clause (e) of the plaint
admitted the ownership of the appellant over the
suit premises and went to the extent of seeking the
mandatory  injunction  against  the  appellant
directing them to accept the monthly rent of the suit
premises from the respondent. 2762.In other words, reading of the aforementioned
paras  in the respondent’s plaint including the relief
clause (e) would go to show that the respondent was
all  along  willing  to  accept  and  indeed  actually
accepted the ownership of the appellant over the
suit  premises  and,  therefore,  sought  mandatory
injunction against the appellant to accept them as
tenant. The conduct of the respondent, therefore,
disentitles them to now raise a new plea questioning
the title of the appellant over the suit premises and
a plea of attornment.  Both, in our opinion, are
wholly misconceived pleas and, therefore, deserve to
be rejected.
63.As mentioned above, the title of the landlord
over the tenanted premises in a suit for eviction
cannot be examined like a title suit. Similarly, the
attornment can be proved by several circumstances28including taking into consideration the conduct of
the tenant qua landlord.   
64.The  aforesaid  three  circumstances,  in  our
opinion,  are,  therefore,  more  than  sufficient  to
record a finding that the appellant was prima facie
able to prove their title over the suit premises so
also was able to prove the factum of  “attornment”
made  by  the  respondent  in  relation  to  the  suit
premises in appellant’s favour thereby entitling the
appellant  to  determine  the  contractual  tenancy
which was devolved upon them by operation of law.
65.In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are
unable to agree with the view taken by the Division
Bench that there was some dispute or confusion as
to who is the owner of the suit premises. In our
view,  there  was  neither  any  dispute  and  nor
confusion and nor any ambiguity over the question29of title over the suit premises which needed any
elaborate inquiry. 
66.  This takes us to examine the next question as
to what was the monthly rent of the suit premises –
whether  Rs.1600/-  towards  monthly  rent  and
Rs.38,400/-  towards  maintenance  charges  as
claimed  by  the  respondent  or  Rs.40,000/-  as
claimed by the appellant.
67.In  our  view,  the  monthly  rent  of  the  suit
premises was Rs.40,000/-. It is for the reason that
Firstly,  the  respondent  had  been  paying
Rs.40,000/- per month to their previous landlord –
GEHA for a long time; Second, the bifurcation of
Rs.40,000/- was being sought by the respondent so
that they may get the benefit of applicability of the
Tenancy Act to defend therein tenant’s right which
they failed to prove and lastly, the rent receipts filed
by the parties clearly proved that the monthly rent30of  the  suit  premises  was  Rs.40,000/-  and  not
Rs.1600/-.  
68.This takes us to examine the next question as
to whether the suit filed by the appellant invoking
the provisions of the TP Act was maintainable or it
should have been filed under the Tenancy Act.
69.In our opinion, the appellant rightly filed the
suit by invoking the provisions of the TP Act. It is
for the reason that once the monthly rent of the suit
premises was found to exceed the limit prescribed
under Section 3(f) of the Tenancy Act, the provisions
of the Tenancy Act had no application to the suit
premises.
70.Section 3(f) of the Tenancy Act says that any
premises let out for non-residential purpose when
carries more than Rs. 10,000/- as monthly rent in
the areas included within the limits of Municipal31Corporation, the provisions of the Tenancy Act will
not apply. 
71.In the case at hand, the monthly rent of the
suit premises was Rs.40,000/- and, therefore, the
appellant was well within their right to file summary
suit against the tenant's eviction and for recovery of
the  arrears  of  rent  by  taking  recourse  to  the
provisions of the TP Act read with Rule 1(B) of The
Rules applicable to the suits filed on the original
side jurisdiction of the High Court at Calcutta.
72.In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are
of the view that the respondent failed to raise any
arguable and substantial defense as required under
Rule 6 read with Rule 9 of the Rules and the three
grounds raised for seeking leave to defend the suit
were only for the sake of raising and had no factual
or/and legal foundation to stand for trial in the suit
and  hence  no  leave  can  be  granted  to  the32respondent on such grounds under Rule 9 of the
Rules.  It  was,  therefore,  rightly  declined  by  the
Single Judge but wrongly granted by the Division
Bench.
73.In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal
succeeds and is allowed. Impugned judgment is set
aside and that of the Single Judge is restored.  
74.The respondent is granted six months’ time to
vacate the suit premises subject to the condition
that they shall deposit the entire arrears of rent up
to date at the rate of Rs.40,000/- per month within
one  month  from  the  date  of this order  and also
deposit six months’ rent by way of damages for use
and occupation within one month in advance. 
75.The  entire  amount,  as  directed  above,  be
deposited with the High Court. The appellant shall
be entitled to withdraw the sum so deposited. The
respondent shall also furnish the  undertaking in33this  Court within two  weeks stating therein that
they will vacate the suit premises within six months
from the date of this order and will also deposit the
sum, as directed above, in time. Failure to file the
undertaking and deposit of the amount will entitle
the  appellant  to  execute  this  order  against  the
respondent on the expiry of one month.
76.As  a  consequence  of  this  judgment,  all  the
pending  cases  mentioned  above  such  as,  C.S.
No.53/2007, Title Suit No.1183/2012, and W.P. No.
569 of 2004 which were filed by the parties against
each other in various Courts in relation to the suit
premises and, if pending till date, stand accordingly
disposed of.

 1.Leave granted.
2.This appeal is filed against the final judgment
and   order   dated   10.09.2018  passed   by   the   High
Court of Judicature at Allahabad in an Application
No.35 of 2017 filed under Section 482 of the Code of
1Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as
“the Code”) whereby the Single Judge of the High
Court   dismissed   the   application   filed   by   the
appellants herein.
3.Few facts need mention  infra to appreciate the
short controversy involved in this appeal.
4.By impugned order, the Single Judge of the
High   Court   dismissed   the   appellants’   application
filed under Section 482 of the Code wherein the
challenge was to quash Charge Sheet No.1 dated
07.05.2016 in Case Crime No.441 of 2015   under
Sections   420,   406   and   504   of   the   Indian   Penal
Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as “IPC”), P.S.
Khair,   District   Aligarh   in   Case   No.486   of   2016
(State vs. Lajpat & Ors. ) pending in the Court of
Judicial Magistrate, Khair, Aligarh.
5.The   short   question,   which   arises   for
consideration in this appeal, is whether the High
2Court   was   justified   in   dismissing   the   appellants’
application filed under Section 482 of the Code. 
6.Heard Mr. Siddharth Mittal,   learned counsel
for   the   appellants.     Mr.   Manoj   Mishra,   learned
counsel was asked to take notice for the State.  
7.Having   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are inclined to set aside the impugned order and
remand the case to the High Court for deciding the
appellants’   application,   out   of   which   this   appeal
arises, afresh on merits in accordance with law after
notice to other side.
8.On perusal of the impugned order, we find that
the Single Judge has only quoted the principles of
law laid down by this Court in several decisions
relating to powers of the High Court to interfere in
the cases filed under Section 482 of the Code from
Para 2 to the concluding para but has failed to even
3refer   to   the   facts   of   the   case   with   a   view   to
appreciate the factual controversy, such as, what is
the nature of the complaint/FIR filed against the
appellants, the allegations on which it is filed,  who
filed   it,   the   grounds   on   which   the
complaint/FIR/proceedings   is   challenged   by   the
appellants,   why  such   grounds   are  not   made  out
under Section 482 of the Code etc.
9.We are, therefore, at a loss to know the factual
matrix of the case much less to appreciate except to
read the legal principles laid down by this Court in
several decisions. 
10.In our view, the Single Judge ought to have
first set out the brief facts of the case with a view to
understand the factual matrix of the case and then
examined the challenge made to the proceedings in
the light of the principles of law laid down by this
Court and then recorded his finding as to on what
4basis   and   reasons,   a   case   is   made   out   for   any
interference or not. 
11.In our view, this is the least that is required in
every order to support the conclusion reached for
disposal of the case. It enables the Higher Court to
examine the question as to whether the reasoning
given by the Court below is factually and legally
sustainable. 
12.We find that the aforementioned exercise was
not   done   by   the   High   Court   while   passing   the
impugned order and hence interference is called for.
13. We, therefore, find ourselves unable to concur
with such disposal of the application by the High
Court and feel inclined to set aside the impugned
order and remand the case to the High Court (Single
Judge)   with   a   request   to   decide   the   application
afresh on merits in accordance with law keeping in
5view the aforementioned observations after issuing
notice to respondent Nos. 1 and 2.
14.Having formed an opinion to remand the case
in the light of our reasoning, we do not consider it
proper to go into the merits of the case.
15.In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal
succeeds   and   is   accordingly   allowed.   Impugned

respondents guilty of medical negligence in the treatment of the spouse of the appellant
which eventually led to her death on 15 November 2009. In consequence, the award of
compensation of Rs. 6,00,000 awarded, together with interest, has been reversed. 
4The spouse of the appellant, Madhu Manglik, was about 56 years of age, when
on 14  November, 2009, she  was  diagnosed with  dengue fever. The  report of the
pathological laboratory, Glaze Pathology, reported the following state of health:
                                “RBC- 4.21 Million/cmm
        Hb-12,1 gm/d/ TLC-1900/Cmm
        Platelet Count 1.79 lakh/cmm
        Dengue Ns 1 Antigen - Positive”
 
The patient was admitted to Chirayu Health & Medicare hospital at Bhopal at about 7
am on 15 November 2009. She was immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
Though she was afebrile, she reported accompanying signs of dengue fever including
headache, body ache and a general sense of restlessness. The patient had a prior
medical  history  which  included  catheter  ablation  and  paroxysmal  supra  ventricular
tachycardia suggestive of cardiac complications.
5Upon admission at about 7.30 am, basic investigations were carried out. The
blood  report,  together  with  the  accompanying  clinical  examination  indicated  the
following position:
“Hb 13.4
TLC 3000/Cumm,
Platelet count 97000/cumim,
PS for MP no malarial parasite seen
Blood urea 21 mg%
Serum bilirubin img%
SGPT 521 U/L,
SGOT 105Mg/dl
ELECTROLYTE Sodium 140 meq/L
Potasium 4.0 meq/L Ex R4
Urine test normal Ex R6
10.00 am – Pulse-88/min,
Bp. 130/88 mm Hg
Temp. A febrile c/o Pain in abdomen3
At 2.00 pm – p-128/min, mildly febrile
BP – 110/70 mm Hg”
        
  
Since the patient was complaining of abdominal discomfort, an ultrasonography of the
abdomen was carried out.
6By 6 pm, on the date of admission the patient was sinking, her blood pressure
was non-recordable, extremities were cold and the pulse was non-palpable. In the
meantime, the patient was placed on a regime of administering intravenous fluids. The
administration of 2500ml of fluids was planned over the course of 24 hours. Between 7
am and 6 pm, she was administered about 1200 ml of fluids. The patient developed
bradycardia  and  cardiac  arrest.  Faced  with  this  situation,  the  treating  doctors
administered about 1.5 litres of extra fluids. Fluids and colloids were administered for
increasing the blood pressure.
7Since the blood pressure of the patient did not improve, she was administered
ionotropes (dopamine & non adrenaline). At 6.45 pm, the patient suffered a cardiac
arrest. Her cardiac levels were monitored. At 6.55 pm she was examined by Dr  C C
Chaubey.
8Belatedly, at 7.15 pm, another blood sample was taken, which indicated the
following results:-
“Hb – 8.1/d/
TLC-7,400/Cumm
Platelet count 19000/cmm Ex R 10
Total protein- 3.9 gms%
A/G Ratio – 2
SGOT 169 IU/L”            
 
9At 8 pm, the patient had a cardiac arrest. She was declared dead at 8.50 pm. 4
10A complaint of medical negligence was instituted before the Medical Council of
India.
11The Ethics Committee of the Medical Council of India came to the conclusion on
20 February 2015 that though the treating doctors had administered treatment to the
patient in accordance with the established medical guidelines, the treatment was not
timely.  The  Ethics  Committee,  prima  facie,  found  that  there  was  professional
misconduct on the part of both the Director of the Hospital Dr Ajay Goenka (respondent
No. 2) and Dr Abhay Tyagi. The Ethics Committee observed thus:
“…..After perusing the statements given by both the parties and
documents  on  record  in  the  case,  the  Ethics  Committee
discussed  the  matter  in  detailed  and  noted  that  the  patient
admitted in Chirayu Health & Medicare Pvt. Ltd., Malipura,
Bhopal on the advice of Dr. A. Goenka but he never visited in
hospital to see the patient. The committee further noted that
treatment administered to the deceased in the hospital was
correct as per the medical guidelines but not given timely.
  Although, Dr. Goenka did not went ( sic)to hospital to see the
patient as the patient admitted there as per his assurance and
advice, therefore, the Ethics committee prima facie found that
there is a professional misconduct on the part of both the doctors
and decided to issue a warning to Dr. A. Goenka and Dr. Abhay
Tyagi with the directions to be more careful in future while treating
such type of patients/cases”
(Emphasis supplied)
 
12This recommendation was accepted by the Executive Committee of the Medical
Council. The appellate order of the Medical Council was communicated on 15 July
2015.
13The appellant instituted a complaint before the SCDRC seeking an award of
compensation in the amount of Rs. 48 lakhs on the ground that his spouse  suffered an
untimely death due to the medical negligence of the treating doctors at the hospital.
14By its judgment dated 27 April 2015, the SCDRC came to the conclusion that a5
case of medical negligence was established. An amount of Rs. 6 lakhs was awarded to
the appellant by way of compensation, together with interest at the rate of 9 per cent
per annum.
15In  appeal,  these  findings  have  been  reversed  by  the  NCDRC  and  in
consequence, the claim stands dismissed.
16Assailing the decision of the NCDRC, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
appellant submits that:
(i)      The patient was admitted to the hospital on 15 November 2009 with a reported
case of dengue, though in a stable condition; 
(ii)     The hospital and the treating doctors failed to follow the established protocol in
treating a case of dengue; 
(iii)     The line of treatment was contrary to  established guidelines, formulated by the
World Health Organisation, titled “Dengue Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment,
Prevention and Control”;
(iv)     Except for the blood sample which was taken at about 7.30 am, no further effort
was made to determine the hematocrit levels (HCT) during the course of the day
and it was only when the patient suffered a cardiac arrest after 6 pm that blood
investigations were done at about 7.15 pm;   
(v)       The trajectory of the illness indicated that the platelet levels which stood at
1,79,000 on 14 November 2009 had recorded a steep decline and stood at
97,000 on 15 January 2009 when she was admitted to the hospital;   
(vi)     Admittedly, fluids were administered to the patient as a part of the treatment
protocol;  
(vii)     The  administration  of  fluids  ought  to  have  been  accompanied  by  regular6
monitoring  of  blood  levels  which  would  have  indicated  that  there  was  a
precipitous decline in the platelet counts and in the HCT levels;
(viii)    Plasma  leakage,  hemorrhagic  fever  or  dengue  shock  syndrome  are  likely
concomitants in the trajectory of such a disease;   
(ix)     In the absence of regular monitoring, the treating doctors were guilty of medical
negligence. As a result of their negligence, the doctors precluded themselves
from receiving information in regard to the status or progression of the disease;  
(x)     The findings of the SCDRC were reversed by the NCDRC without any basis or
justification;  
(xi)     NCDRC has found fault with the patient’s family for the administration of aspirin in
the day preceding her admission to the hospital; 
(xii)    The fact that she was administered aspirin was disclosed to the treating doctors
at  the  time  of  admission,  which  is  satisfactorily  established  by  the  medical
records of the case;
(xiii)   NCDRC, in the first appeal, has displaced the findings of fact which have been
arrived at by the SCDRC without any basis in the evidence on record; and
(xiv)  On the question of compensation, the appellant had also instituted a first appeal
before the NCDRC since the award of compensation was inadequate. On the
material  which  was  placed  on  the  record  before  the  original  authority,  it  is
necessary for this Court to allow the appeal and to suitably enhance the amount
of compensation.
17On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents
submitted that:
(i) The  patient  had  been  suffering  from  fever  from  several  days  prior  to  her
admission  to  the  hospital.  She  was  stable  at  the  time  of  admission  on  157
November 2009;
(ii) The  patient  did  not  go  into  a  situation  of  a  dengue  shock  syndrome  or
hemorrhagic fever during the course of the day when she was admitted to the
hospital;  
(iii) In such a situation, no requirement of regular monitoring of HCT was warranted
in accordance with the guidelines which have been prescribed by the Directorate
of National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (DNVBDCP);  
(iv) The above guidelines, which have been prescribed by the Union of India under
the National Rural Health Mission, would indicate that it is only in a situation
involving dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome that further steps
would be necessary;
(v) The fluids which were administered to the patient did not require a  monitoring of
the blood more than twice a day and it was only in the evening that the HCT
levels were required to be evaluated;
(vi) The patient had prior cardiac complications for which she had been on an aspirin
regime prior to admission to the hospital. She was carefully monitored by a team
of four doctors at the hospital;
(vii) The treatment protocol which was followed was consistent with the guidelines
which have been prescribed both by WHO as well as by the National Vector
Borne Diseases Control Programme;
(viii)  As held in the decision of this Court in Kusum Sharma   v Batra Hospital and
Medical Research Centre3, the duty of care which is required of a doctor is one
involving a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge; and
(ix)   The patient in the present case had prior complications and the treatment which
was administered followed an established protocol.
3 (2010) 3 SCC 4808
18The rival submissions now fall for consideration.
19We will proceed on the basis of the facts as they stand admitted on the basis of
the record and in the counter affidavit which has been filed by the respondents. 
20    Between 14 January 2009 when the blood report of the patient was obtained from
Glaze Pathology Lab and the morning of the following day on which she was admitted
to the hospital, the platelet count had recorded a precipitous decline from 1,79,000 to
97,000. This undoubtedly, as the hospital urges in the present case, is a consequence
of dengue. The patient had tested positive in the Dengue Antigen test. At 7.30 am, on
15 January 2009, her Hemoglobin was reported to be 13.4.  The patient was thereafter
placed on a treatment protocol involving the administration of intravenous fluids.
21The condition of the patient was serious enough to require her admission to the
Intensive Care Unit of the hospital. The hospital has justified the administration of about
1200 ml of fluid between 7 am and 6 pm when she developed bradycardia and cardiac
arrest.
22The real bone of contention in the present case is not the decision which was
taken by the doctors to place the patient on a regime of intravenous fluids which, for the
purposes of the present appeals, the Court ought to proceed as being on the basis of
an established protocol.
23The  essential  aspect  of  the  case,  which  bears  out  the  charge  of  medical
negligence, is that between 7.30 am when the patient was admitted to hospital and 6
pm  when  she  developed  cardiac  arrest,  the  course  of  treatment  which  has  been9
disclosed in the counter affidavit does not indicate any further monitoring of essential
parameters particularly those which could be detected by a laboratory analysis of blood
samples.
24Since  her  admission  and  through  the  day,  the  patient  was  administered
intravenous fluids. The fluids were enhanced at 6 pm by 1.5 litres after she developed
cardiac arrest.  The record before the Court indicates that even thereafter, it was only at
7.15 pm that her blood levels were monitored. The lab report indicated a hemoglobin
level of 8.1 and platelet count at 19,000.   By then, the patient had developed acute
signs of cardiac distress and she eventually died within a couple of hours thereafter.  
25The requirement of carefully monitoring a patient in such a situation is stipulated
both by the guidelines of the World Health Organisation on which the appellant has
placed reliance as well as in those incorporated by the Directorate of the National
Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme in 2008.
26   The WHO guidelines indicate that Dengue is a ‘systemic and dynamic disease’
which usually consists of three phases i.e. febrile, critical and recovery.  There had been
a precipitous decline in the patient’s platelet count the day she was admitted to the
hospital. The WHO guidelines inter alia state as follows:
 
“2.1.2 Critical phase
 
  ……
Progressive leukopenia (3) followed by a rapid decrease in
platelet count usually precedes plasma leakage .   At this point
patients without an increase in capillary permeability will improve,
while those with increased capillary permeability may become
worse as a result of lost plasma volume.   The degree of plasma
leakage  varies.  Pleural  effusion  and  ascites  may  be  clinically
detectable depending on the degree of plasma leakage and the
volume  of  fluid  therapy.   Hence  chest  x-ray  and  abdominal
ultrasound can be useful tools for diagnoses.    The degree of
increase  above  the  baseline  haematocrit  often  reflects  the
severity of plasma leakage.”10
      
Clause 2.3.2.2 of the WHO guidelines  deals with patients who should be referred for in-
hospital management (Group B). 
“ Patients  may need to be admitted to a secondary health care
centre for close observation, particularly  as  they  approach  the
critical  phase.  These include patients  with  warning  signs,
those  with co-existing conditions that may make dengue or
its management more complicated  (such  as  pregnancy,
infancy,  old  age,  obesity,  diabetes  mellitus,  renal failure,
chronic  haemolytic  diseases),  and  those  with  certain  social
circumstances (such as living alone, or living far from a health
facility without reliable means of transport).
If the patient has dengue with warning signs, the action plan
should be as follows:
• Obtain a reference haematocrit before fluid therapy. Give only
isotonic  solutions  such  as  0.9%  saline,  Ringer’s  lactate,  or
Hartmann’s solution. Start with 5–7 ml/ kg/hour for 1–2 hours,
then reduce to 3–5 ml/kg/hr for 2–4 hours, and then reduce to 2–
3 ml/kg/hr or less according to the clinical response (Textboxes H,
J and K).
•  Reassess the clinical status and repeat the haematocrit. If the
haematocrit remains the same or rises only minimally, continue
with the same rate (2–3 ml/kg/hr)  for another 2–4 hours. If the
vital  signs  are  worsening  and  haematocrit  is  rising   rapidly,
increase  the  rate  to  5–10  ml/kg/hour   for   1–2  hours.
Reassess  the  clinical status, repeat the haematocrit and review
fluid infusion rates accordingly.
Give the minimum intravenous fluid volume required to maintain
good perfusion and urine output of about 0.5 ml/kg/hr. Intravenous
fluids  are  usually  needed   for  only  24–48  hours.  Reduce
intravenous  fluids  gradually  when  the  rate  of  plasma  leakage
decreases towards the end of the critical phase. This is indicated
by urine output and/or oral fluid intake that is/are adequate, or
haematocrit   decreasing below  the baseline value in a stable
patient.
•   Patients with warning signs should be monitored by health care
providers until the period of risk is over. A detailed fluid balance
should be maintained.     Parameters that should be monitored
include vital signs and peripheral perfusion (1–4 hourly until the
patient is out of the critical phase), urine output (4–6 hourly),
haematocrit  (before  and  after  fluid  replacement,  then  6–12
hourly), blood    glucose, and other organ functions (such as renal
profile, liver profile, coagulation  
profile, as indicated).
Patients should be monitored by health care providers for
temperature  pattern,  volume  of  fluid  intake  and  losses,  urine
output (volume and frequency), warning  signs, haematocrit, and
white blood cell and platelet counts (Textbox L). Other laboratory
tests  (such  as  liver  and  renal  functions  tests)  can  be  done,
depending  on the clinical picture and the facilities of the hospital
or health centre.”11
According to clause 7.1 of the guidelines of the Directorate of the National Vector Borne
Diseases  Control  Programme  (2008),  the  basic  management  of  dengue  patients
admitted to hospital includes the following:
“- a mosquito-free environment in hospital
-close monitoring of patient vitals, input and output, oxygen
saturation, sensorium
-early identification of warning signs and symptoms
-avoid NSAID and intramuscular injections
-psychological support for patient and family.”
The  presence  of the  following  signs  and  symptoms  requires  close monitoring  and
management (Clause 7.2):
“-  respiratory distress
-oxygen desaturation
-severe abdominal pain
-excessive vomiting
-altered sensorium, confusion
-convulsions
-rapid and thready pulse
-narrowing of pulse pressure less than 20 mmHg
-urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/h
-laboratory  evidence  of thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy,  
rising  Hct,  metabolic
-acidosis, derangement of liver/kidney function tests.”
27The patient had a prior medical history which included catheter ablation and
paroxysmal supra ventricular tachycardia suggestive of cardiac complications and thus
fell in the group of patients that require in-hospital management (Group B) under WHO
guidelines. The patient was evidently suffering from abdominal discomfort and hospital
authorities were required to closely monitor her condition. In failing to do so in a timely
manner,  the  respondents  were  unable  to  meet  the  standard  of  reasonable  care
expected of medical services.
28The issue is not whether the patient had already entered a situation involving
haemorrhagic  fever or a  dengue shock  syndrome  when  she  was  admitted  on the12
morning of 15 November 2009.  The real charge of medical negligence stems from the
failure of the hospital to regularly monitor the blood parameters of the patient during the
course of the day.  Had this been done, there can be no manner of doubt that the
hospital would have been alive to a situation that there was a decline progressively in
the patient’s condition which eventually led to cardiac arrest.
29This Court has consistently held in its decisions (the decision in Kusum Sharma
(supra) reiterates that principle) that the standard of care which is expected of a medical
professional is the treatment  which is expected of one with a reasonable degree of skill
and knowledge. A medical practitioner would be liable only where the conduct falls
below the standards of a reasonably competent practitioner in the field.  
30Decisions of this Court elucidate on the standard of care which is expected of
medical practitioners. Medical negligence jurisprudence in India is characterized by a
reliance on the ‘Bolam test’. 
In Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee4, the defendant doctor treating a
patient suffering from mental illness was held not guilty of medical negligence by the
Queens  Bench  for  failure  to  administer  muscle-relaxant  drugs  and  using  physical
restraint in the course of electro-convulsive therapy. Justice McNair, in his directions to
the jury, laid down the following standard of care:
“...I myself would prefer to put it this way, that he is not guilty of
negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted
as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that
particular art. I do not think there is much difference in sense. It is
just a different way of expressing the same thought. Putting it the
other  way  round,  a  man  is  not  negligent,  if  he  is  acting  in
accordance with such a practice, merely because there is a body
of opinion who would take a contrary view…”
4 [1957] 1 WLR 58213
A careful reading of the  Bolam case shows that the standard of “reasonableness” is
implicit in the test. Thus, the court holds:
“…where you get a situation which involves the use of some
special skill or competence, then the test as to whether there has
been negligence or not is not the test of the man on the top of a
Clapham omnibus, because he has not got this special skill. The
test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and
professing to have that special skill. A man need not possess the
highest expert skill; it is well established law that it is sufficient if
he exercises the ordinary skill  of an ordinary competent  man
exercising that particular art. I do not think that I quarrel much
with any of the submissions in law which have been put before
you by counsel. Mr. Fox-Andrews put it in this way, that in the
case of a medical man, negligence means failure to act in
accordance  with  the  standards  of  reasonably  competent
medical  men  at  the  time.  That  is  a  perfectly  accurate
statement, as long as it is remembered that there may be one
or more perfectly proper standards; and if he conforms with
one of those proper standards, then he is not negligent . Mr.
Fox-Andrews also was quite right, in my judgment, in saying
that a mere personal belief that a particular technique is best
is  no  defence  unless  that  belief  is  based  on  reasonable
grounds.”
(Emphasis supplied)
Bolam clarified that the standard imposes a duty on medical professionals to ensure
that obsolete methods are not employed:  
“…At the same time, that does not mean that a medical man can
obstinately and pig-headedly carry on with some old technique if
it has been proved to be contrary to what is really substantially
the whole of informed medical opinion.”
31A three judge Bench of this Court in Dr Laxman Balkrishna Joshi  v Dr Trimbak
Bapu Godbole5 stipulated that the standard to be applied by a medical practitioner
must be of a “reasonable degree of care”: 
“11. The duties which a doctor owes to his patient are clear. A
person who holds himself out ready to give medical advice and
treatment impliedly undertakes that he is possessed of skill and
knowledge for the purpose. Such a person when consulted by a
patient owes him certain duties viz. a duty of care in deciding
whether to undertake the case, a duty of care in deciding what
5 AIR 1969 SC 12814
treatment to give or a duty of care in the administration of that
treatment. A breach of any of those duties gives a right of action
for negligence to the patient. The practitioner must bring to his
task a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must
exercise  a  reasonable  degree  of  care.  Neither  the  very
highest  nor  a  very  low  degree  of  care  and  competence
judged in the light of the particular circumstances of each
case is what the law requires (cf. Halsbury's Laws of England
3rd Edn. Vol. 26 p. 17).”  
32 In Jacob Mathew v State of Punjab6, a three judge Bench of this Court upheld the
standard of the ordinary competent medical practitioner exercising an ordinary degree
of professional skill, as enunciated in Bolam (supra). The Court held that the standard
of care must be in accordance with  “general and approved practice ”:
“24. The classical statement of law in  Bolam  has been widely
accepted as decisive of the standard of care required both of
professional men generally and medical practitioners in particular.
It has been invariably cited with approval before the courts in
India and applied as a touchstone to test the pleas of medical
negligence. In tort, it is enough for the defendant to show that the
standard of care and the skill attained was that of the ordinary
competent medical practitioner exercising an ordinary degree of
professional  skill.  The  fact  that  a  defendant  charged  with
negligence acted in accord with the general and approved
practice is enough to clear him of the charge.  Two things are
pertinent  to  be  noted.  Firstly,  the  standard  of  care,  when
assessing  the  practice  as  adopted,  is  judged  in  the  light  of
knowledge available at the time (of the incident), and not at the
date of trial. Secondly, when the charge of negligence arises out
of failure to use some particular equipment, the charge would fail
if the equipment was not generally available at that point of time
on which it is suggested as should have been used.”
33In  Indian Medical Association  v  V P Shantha7, a three judge Bench of this
Court made the following observations:
“Immunity from suit was enjoyed by certain professions on the
grounds of public interest. The trend is towards narrowing of such
immunity and it is no longer available to architects in respect of
certificates  negligently  given  and  to  mutual  valuers.  Earlier,
barristers  were enjoying complete immunity but  now even for
them the field is limited to work done in court and to a small
category  of  pre-trial  work  which  is  directly  related  to  what
transpires  in court… Medical  practitioners do  not  enjoy any
immunity and they can be sued in contract or tort on the
6 (2005) 6 SCC 1
7 (1995) 6 SCC 65115
ground that they have failed to exercise reasonable skill and
care.”
                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
34A three judge Bench of this Court in  State of Punjab  v Shiv Ram8 and in
Nizam’s  Institute  of  Medical  Sciences  v Prasanth  S  Dhananka9 affirmed  the
judgement in Jacob Matthew.
35A two judge Bench of this Court in Kusum Sharma  (supra) laid down guidelines
to govern cases of medical negligence. Justice Dalveer Bhandari, speaking for the
Court, held: 
“89. On scrutiny of the leading cases of medical negligence both
in our country and other countries specially the United Kingdom,
some  basic  principles  emerge  in  dealing  with  the  cases  of
medical  negligence.  While  deciding  whether  the  medical
professional is guilty of medical negligence following well-known
principles must be kept in view:
I. Negligence is the breach of a duty exercised by omission to do
something  which  a  reasonable  man,  guided  by  those
considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human
affairs,  would  do,  or  doing  something  which  a  prudent  and
reasonable man would not do.
II.  Negligence  is  an  essential  ingredient  of  the  offence.  The
negligence to be established by the prosecution must be culpable
or gross and not the negligence merely based upon an error of
judgment.
III. The medical professional is expected to bring a reasonable
degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable
degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very low degree of
care  and  competence  judged  in  the  light  of  the  particular
circumstances of each case is what the law requires.
IV.  A medical  practitioner  would  be liable only where his
conduct  fell  below  that  of  the  standards of  a reasonably
competent practitioner in his field.
V. In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is scope for
genuine  difference  of  opinion  and  one  professional  doctor  is
clearly not negligent merely because his conclusion differs from
that of other professional doctor.
VI.  The medical  professional  is  often  called  upon  to adopt  a
procedure which involves higher element of risk, but which he
honestly believes as providing greater chances of success for the
8 (2005) 7 SCC 1
9 (2009) 6 SCC 116
patient rather than a procedure involving lesser risk but higher
chances of failure. Just because a professional looking to the
gravity of illness has taken higher element of risk to redeem the
patient out of his/her suffering which did not yield the desired
result may not amount to negligence.
VII. Negligence cannot be attributed to a doctor so long as he
performs his duties with reasonable skill and competence. Merely
because  the  doctor  chooses  one  course  of  action  in
preference to the other one available, he would not be liable
if the course of action chosen by him was acceptable to the
medical profession .
VIII. It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical
profession if no doctor could administer medicine without a halter
round his neck.
IX. It is our bounden duty and obligation of the civil society to
ensure  that  the  medical  professionals  are  not  unnecessarily
harassed or humiliated so that they can perform their professional
duties without fear and apprehension.
X. The medical practitioners at times also have to be saved from
such a class of complainants who use criminal process as a tool
for pressurising the medical professionals/hospitals, particularly
private  hospitals  or  clinics  for  extracting  uncalled  for
compensation.  Such  malicious  proceedings  deserve  to  be
discarded against the medical practitioners.
XI. The medical professionals are entitled to get protection so
long  as  they  perform  their  duties  with  reasonable  skill  and
competence and in the interest of the patients. The interest and
welfare of the patients have to be paramount for the medical
professionals.
90. In our considered view, the aforementioned principles must be
kept in view while deciding the cases of medical negligence. We
should not be understood to have held that doctors can never be
prosecuted for medical negligence. As long as the doctors have
performed  their  duties  and  exercised  an  ordinary  degree  of
professional skill and competence, they cannot be held guilty of
medical negligence. It is imperative that the doctors must be able
to perform their professional duties with free mind.”
                                            (Emphasis supplied)
He referred to the Bolam test and held thus:
“72. The ratio of Bolam case is that it is enough for the defendant
to show that the standard of care and the skill attained was that of
the  ordinary  competent  medical  practitioner  exercising  an
ordinary  degree  of  professional  skill.  The  fact  that  the
respondent  charged  with  negligence  acted  in  accordance
with the general and approved practice is enough to clear
him of the charge.  Two things are pertinent to be noted. Firstly,
the standard of care, when assessing the practice as adopted, is
judged in the light of knowledge available at the time (of the
incident), and not at the date of trial. Secondly, when the charge
of  negligence  arises  out  of  failure  to  use  some  particular17
equipment,  the  charge  would  fail  if  the  equipment  was  not
generally available at that point of time on which it is suggested
as should have been used.”
                                   (Emphasis supplied)
36The “Bolam test” has been the subject of academic debate and evaluation in
India and other jurisdictions.  Among scholars, the Bolam test has been criticized on
the ground that it fails to make the distinction between the ordinary skilled doctor and
the  reasonably  competent doctor.10 The  former  places  emphasis  on  the  standards
adopted by the profession, while the latter denotes that negligence is concerned with
departures from what ought to have been done in the circumstances and may be
measured  by  reference  to  the  hypothetical  “reasonable  doctor”.  The  Court  must
determine what the reasonable doctor would have done and not the profession.  
37Since  the  formulation  of the  Bolam  test, English  Courts  have  formulated  a
significantly nuanced doctrine pertaining to the standard of care. In  Maynard v West
Midlands Regional Health Authority ,11 Lord Scarman held thus: 
“A case which is based on an allegation that a fully considered
decision of two consultants in the field of their special skill was
negligent  clearly presents certain difficulties of  proof.  It is not
enough to show that there is a body of competent professional
opinion which considers that there was a wrong decision, if there
also exists a body of professional opinion, equally competent,
which supports the decision as reasonable in the circumstances.”
38 In  Hucks v  Cole,12 the Court of Appeal found the defendant guilty of medical
negligence. Sachs LJ held thus:
“Where the evidence shows that a lacuna in professional practice
exists by which risks of grave danger are knowingly taken, then
however small the risk the courts must anxiously examine that
lacuna, particularly if the risk can be easily and inexpensively
avoided. If the court finds on an analysis of the reasons given for
10 Michael Jones, Medical negligence, Sweet and Maxwell, Fifth Edition (2017)
11 1985] 1 All ER 635 
12 (1968) 118 New LJ 46918
not  taking  those  precautions  that  in  the  light  of  current
professional knowledge there is no proper basis for the lacuna,
and that it is definitely not reasonable that those risks should
have been taken, its function is to state that fact, and where
necessary to state that it constitutes negligence.”
39     In Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority ,13 the House of Lords held that
the course adopted by the medical practitioner must stand a test to reason:
“...in my view, the court is not bound to hold that a defendant
doctor escapes liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just
because he leads evidence from a number of medical experts
who are genuinely of opinion that the defendant's treatment or
diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice. In the  Bolam
case itself, McNair J. stated that the defendant had to have acted
in  accordance  with  the  practice  accepted  as  proper  by  a
“responsible body of medical men.” Later, at p. 588, he referred to
“a standard of practice recognised as proper by a competent
reasonable body of opinion.” Again, in the passage which I have
cited  from  Maynard's  case,  Lord  Scarman  refers  to  a
“respectable” body of  professional opinion.  The use of these
adjectives—responsible,  reasonable  and  respectable—all
show that the court has to be satisfied that the exponents of
the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such
opinion has a logical basis.  In particular in cases involving, as
they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge
before  accepting  a  body  of  opinion  as  being  responsible,
reasonable  or  respectable,  will  need  to  be  satisfied  that,  in
forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the
question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a
defensible conclusion on the matter.”
                                                            (Emphasis supplied)
Granting  due  deference  to  the  profession  of  medical  practitioners,  Lord  Browne-
Wilkinson held that it is only in a ‘rare case’ when professional opinion is not capable of
‘withstanding logical analysis’, that the judge may hold that it is not reasonable or
responsible:
“These decisions  demonstrate that  in cases  of  diagnosis  and
treatment there are cases where, despite a body of professional
opinion sanctioning the defendant's conduct, the defendant can
properly be held liable for negligence (I am not here considering
questions of disclosure of risk). In my judgment that is because,
in  some  cases,  it  cannot  be  demonstrated  to  the  judge's
satisfaction that the body of opinion relied upon is reasonable or
responsible.  In  the  vast  majority  of  cases  the  fact  that
distinguished experts in the field are of a particular opinion will
demonstrate the reasonableness  of  that  opinion.  In  particular,
where there are questions of assessment of the relative risks and
13 (1996) 4 All ER 77119
benefits of adopting a particular medical practice, a reasonable
view necessarily presupposes that the relative risks and benefits
have been weighed by the experts in forming their opinions. But
if,  in  a  rare  case,  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  the
professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logical
analysis,  the  judge  is  entitled  to  hold  that  the  body  of
opinion is not reasonable or responsible.
I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a
judge to reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a
competent medical expert are unreasonable . The assessment
of  medical  risks and benefits  is a matter  of  clinical  judgment
which a judge would not normally be able to make without expert
evidence. As the quotation from Lord Scarman makes clear, it
would be wrong to allow such assessment  to deteriorate into
seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views both of
which are capable of being logically supported. It is only where a
judge can be satisfied that the body of expert opinion cannot be
logically supported at all that such opinion will not provide the
benchmark by reference to which the defendant's conduct falls to
be assessed.”
                                                            (Emphasis supplied)
40Closer home, in  V Kishan Rao  v Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital ,14 a two
judge Bench of this Court highlighted the shortcomings of the Bolam test: 
“19. Even though Bolam test was accepted by this Court as providing
the standard norms in cases of medical negligence, in the country of
its origin, it is questioned on various grounds. It has been found that
the inherent danger in Bolam test is that if the courts defer too readily
to  expert  evidence  medical  standards  would  obviously  decline.
Michael  Jones  in  his  treatise  on  Medical  Negligence  (Sweet  and
Maxwell), 4th Edn., 2008 criticised the  Bolam test as it opts for the
lowest common denominator. The learned author noted that opinion
was gaining ground in England that Bolam test should be restricted to
those cases where an adverse result follows a course of treatment
which  has  been  intentional  and  has  been  shown  to  benefit  other
patients previously. This should not be extended to certain types of
medical accidents merely on the basis of how common they are. It is
felt  “to  do  this  would  set  us  on  the  slippery  slope  of  excusing
carelessness when it happens often enough” (see Michael Jones on
Medical Negligence , para 3-039 at p. 246).
24 With the coming into effect of the Human Rights Act, 1998 from 2-
10-2000  in  England,  the  State's  obligations  under  the  European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) are justiciable in the domestic
courts of England. Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, 1998 reads as
under:
“Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be
deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of
a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is
provided by law.”
25. Even though  Bolam test “has not been uprooted” it has come
under  some criticism as  has been noted in Jackson &  Powell  on
14  (2010) 5 SCC 51320
Professional Negligence  (Sweet and Maxwell), 5th Edn., 2002. The
learned authors have noted (see para 7-047 at p. 200 in Professional
Negligence) that there is an argument to the effect that Bolam test is
inconsistent with the right to life unless the domestic courts construe
that the requirement to take reasonable care is equivalent with the
requirement of making adequate provision for medical care.  In the
context  of  such  jurisprudential  thinking  in  England,  time  has
come for this Court also to reconsider the parameters set down
in Bolam test as a guide to decide cases on medical negligence
and  specially  in  view  of  Article  21  of  our  Constitution  which
encompasses within its guarantee, a right to medical treatment
and medical care.”
                                        (Emphasis supplied)
41Our law must take into account advances in medical science and ensure that a
patient-centric approach is adopted.  The standard of care as enunciated in the Bolam
case must evolve in consonance with its subsequent interpretation by English and
Indian Courts. Significantly, the standard adopted by the three-judge bench of this Court
in  Jacob Matthew  includes the requirement that the course adopted by the medical
professional be consistent with “general and approved practice” and we are bound by
this decision.
42In adopting a standard of care, Indian courts must be conscious of the fact that a
large number of hospitals and medical units in our country, especially in rural areas, do
not have access to latest technology and medical equipment. A two judge bench of this
Court in Martin F D'Souza v Mohd. Ishfaq15  held thus:
“37. The  standard  of  care  has  to  be  judged  in  the  light  of
knowledge available at the time of the incident and not at the date
of the trial. Also, where the charge of negligence is of failure to
use  some  particular  equipment,  the  charge  would  fail  if  the
equipment was not generally available at that point of time.”  
43In the practice of medicine, there could be varying approaches to treatment.
There can be a genuine difference of opinion. However, while adopting a course of
treatment,  the  medical  professional  must  ensure  that  it  is  not  unreasonable.  The
threshold to prove unreasonableness is set with due regard to the risks associated with
15 (2009) 3 SCC 1 21
medical treatment and the conditions under which medical professionals function. This
is to avoid a situation where doctors resort to ‘defensive medicine’ to avoid claims of
negligence, often to the detriment of the patient. Hence, in a specific case where
unreasonableness  in  professional  conduct  has  been  proven  with  regard  to  the
circumstances of that case, a professional cannot escape liability for medical evidence
merely by relying on a body of professional opinion. 
44In the present case, the record which stares in the face of the adjudicating
authority establishes that between 7.30 am and 7 pm, the critical parameters of the
patient were not evaluated. The simple expedient of monitoring blood parameters was
not undergone. This was in contravention of WHO guidelines as well as the guidelines
prescribed by the Directorate of National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme. It
was the finding of the Medical Council of India that while treatment was administered to
the patient according to these guidelines, the patient did not receive timely treatment. It
had accordingly administered a warning to the respondents to be more careful in the
future. In failing to provide medical treatment in accordance with medical guidelines, the
respondents failed to satisfy the standard of reasonable care as laid down in the Bolam
case and adopted by Indian Courts.  To say that the patient or her family would have
resisted a blood test, as is urged by the respondents, is merely a conjecture. Since no
test was done, such an explanation cannot be accepted.
45The NCDRC had before it a well-considered judgment of the SCDRC based on
the evidence on the record.   While the jurisdiction of an adjudicatory authority in a first
appeal is co-extensive with that of the original authority, the NCDRC has displaced the
findings  of  fact  which  have  been  arrived  at  by  the  SCDRC  without  any  cogent
reasoning.22
46The appellate authority has placed a considerable degree of reliance on the fact
that the patient was on aspirin. This circumstance was drawn to the attention of the
treating doctors at the time of admission. The NCDRC has merely observed that once
she was admitted to the hospital, the patient was given medicines. This, in our view, is
an insufficient basis to displace the findings of fact and conclusions recorded by the
SCDRC.
47For the above reasons, we are of the view that the judgment of the NCDRC is
unsustainable.   There was no basis or justification to reverse the finding of medical
negligence which was arrived at by the SCDRC.
48However,  in  our  view,  there  is  no  basis  for  recording  a  finding  of  medical
negligence against the Director of the hospital.  The Director of the hospital was not the
treating doctor or the referring doctor.   Hence, while the finding of medical negligence
against  the  hospital  would  stand  confirmed,  the  second  respondent  would  not  be
personally liable.
49That leads the Court to the question of damages.  Finding the hospital and its
Director guilty of medical negligence, the SCDRC directed compensation in the amount
of Rs. 6 lakhs together with interest at 9 per cent.
50While quantifying the compensation, the SCDRC was in error in holding that
since the son and daughter of the appellant are “highly educated and working” and had
not  joined  as  complainants,  the  complainant  himself  would  be  entitled  to  receive
compensation only in the amount of Rs. 6 lakhs.
51The complainant has lost his spouse, who was 56 years of age. Though she was
not employed, it is now well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court that the23
contribution  made  by  a  non-working  spouse  to  the  welfare  of  the  family  has  an
economic equivalent.
52   In Lata Wadhwa v State of Bihar,16 a three judge Bench of this Court computed
damages to be paid to dependants of deceased persons  as well as burn victims in the
aftermath  of a  fire  at  the  factory  premises. The  Court took  into  consideration  the
multifarious services rendered to the home by a home-maker and held the estimate
arrived at Rs 12,000 per annum to be grossly low. It was enhanced to Rs 36,000 per
annum for the age group of 34 to 59 years. 
53    In Malay Kumar Ganguly v Sukumar Mukherjee ,17 Justice S B Sinha held thus: 
“172. Loss  of  wife  to  a  husband  may  always  be  truly
compensated  by  way  of  mandatory  compensation.  How  one
would  do  it  has  been  baffling  the  court  for  a  long  time.  For
compensating a husband for loss of his wife, therefore, the courts
consider the loss of income to the family. It may not be difficult to
do  when  she  had  been  earning.  Even  otherwise  a  wife's
contribution  to  the  family  in  terms  of  money  can  always  be
worked out. Every housewife makes a contribution to his family. It
is  capable  of  being  measured  on  monetary  terms  although
emotional aspect of it cannot be. It depends upon her educational
qualification, her own upbringing, status, husband's income, etc.”
Thus, in computing compensation payable on the death of a home-maker spouse who
is not employed, the Court must bear in mind that the contribution is significant and
capable of being measured in monetary terms.
54In assessing the amount of compensation, we have been guided by the principle
which has been laid down by the Constitution Bench  in Lata Wadhwa and in National
Insurance  Company  Ltd.  v  Pranay  Sethi18 with  suitable  modifications  in  a  case
involving medical negligence.
55In our view, the interests of justice would be met, if the amount of compensation
16 (2001) 8 SCC 197
17 (2009) 3 SCC 663
18 (2017) 13 SCALE 1224
is enhanced. We accordingly, direct that the appellant shall be entitled to receive an
amount of Rs. 15 lakhs by way of compensation from the first respondent.
56The compensation, as awarded, shall carry interest at the rate of 9 per cent per
annum from the date of the institution of the complaint before the SCDRC until payment
or realisation. Payment should be effected within two months.
57The appeals are allowed in these terms. There shall be no order as to costs.

Siddalingayya  ….Appellant(s)
VERSUS
Gurulingappa & Ors.       …Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1)This appeal is filed by the plaintiff against the
final judgment and order dated 24.06.2005 passed
by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in RSA
No.220 of 2003 whereby the High Court allowed the
second appeal filed by the respondents herein and
while setting aside the judgment/decree of the two
Courts below remanded the case to the Trial Court
for  deciding  the  civil  suit  afresh  on  merits  after
1affording  an  opportunity  to  the
respondents(defendants) to file written statement. 
2)The Controversy involved in the appeal lies in a
narrow  compass.  Few  facts  set  out  hereinbelow
would make the controversy clear. 
3) The  appellant  is  the  plaintiff  whereas  the
respondents are the defendants in the suit out of
which this appeal arises.
4)The appellant filed a civil suit being O.S. 286
of 1993 against the respondents (defendants) in the
Court  of  Munsiff  -  Indi  (Bijapur)  for  recovery  of
Rs.45,000/- by way of damages.  According to the
appellant, the respondents illegally demolished his
construction and thereby caused monetary loss and
injury  to  him  and  hence  the  suit  to  recover  the
monetary loss suffered by him.
25) The  respondents  entered  appearance  but
failed to file their  written statement despite time
granted by the Court.
6)The  Trial  Court,  however,  declined  to  grant
further  time  to  file  written  statement  to  the
respondents  though  asked  for  and  accordingly
proceeded  to  record  evidence  of  the  appellant
(plaintiff)  and  by  judgment/decree  dated
24.02.1997,  decreed  the  suit  of  the
appellant(plaintiff)  for  Rs.45,000/-  against  the
respondents(defendants).
7)The defendants, felt aggrieved, filed first appeal
before the Principal Civil Judge at Bijapur  being
R.A.  No.103  of  1997.   By  judgment  dated
04.12.2002,  the  Appellate  Court  dismissed  the
appeal  and  affirmed  the  judgment/decree  of  the
Trial  Court.  Felt  aggrieved,  the  defendants  filed
3second appeal being R.S.A. No.220 of 2003  before
the High Court. 
8)By  impugned  judgment,  the  High  Court
allowed the second appeal and while setting aside
the  judgment/decree  of  the  two  Courts  below
remanded the case to the Trial Court for deciding
the  civil suit  afresh  on  merits  after  affording  an
opportunity to the respondents (defendants) to file
written statement. 
9)It was held that the Trial Court did not grant
sufficient  opportunity  to  the  respondents  to  file
written statement, due to which they had to suffer
the decree without any contest causing prejudice in
defending  the  suit.  The  High  Court,  however,
imposed a cost of Rs.11,250/- on the defendants to
be paid to the plaintiff as a pre-condition for filing
the  written  statement  within  the  extended  time
granted.
410)It is against this order of the High Court, the
plaintiff has felt aggrieved and filed this appeal by
way of special leave before this Court.
11)   Mr.  Rajesh  Mahale,  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant  (plaintiff).  None  appeared  for  the
respondents though served.
12)Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellant and on perusal of the record of the case,
we are not inclined to interfere in the remand order
of the High Court impugned in this appeal.
13)This case reminds us of the apt observations of
a great Judge of this Court (Vivian Bose, J.). His
Lordship, speaking for the Bench, in his inimitable
style of writing said in Sangram Singh vs. Election
Tribunal  Kotah  &  Anr.  (AIR  1955  SC  425)  as
under:
“A Code of procedure must be regarded as
such.  It is procedure something designed to
facilitate justice and further its ends: not a
penal  enactment  for  punishment  and
5penalties; not a thing designed to trip people
up.  Too technical a construction of sections
that leaves no room for reasonable elasticity
of interpretation should therefore be guarded
against (provided always that justice is done
to both sides) lest the very means designed
for  the  furtherance  of  justice  be  used  to
frustrate  it.   Our  laws  of  procedure  are
grounded  on  a  principle  of  natural  justice
which  requires  that  men  should  not  be
condemned  unheard,  that  decisions  should
not  be  reached  behind  their  backs,  that
proceedings  that  affect  their  lives  and
property  should  not  continue  in  their
absence and that they should not continue in
their absence and that they should not be
precluded  from  participating  in  them.   Of
course, there must be exceptions and where
they are clearly defined they must be given
effect to.  But taken by and large, and subject
to that proviso, our laws of procedure should
be  construed,  wherever  that  is  reasonably
possible, in the light of that principle.”
14)Keeping  the  aforementioned  observations  in
mind and examining the facts of the case at hand,
we  are  of  the  considered  opinion  that  the  High
Court made no mistake in allowing the respondents’
appeal and remanding the suit to the Trial Court for
fresh trial on merits after affording an opportunity
to the respondents (defendants) to file their written
6statement  to  enable them  to  contest the suit on
merits. 
15)It  is true  that  the  time  was  granted to  the
defendants to file written statement initially before
closing their right to file written statement, yet in
our view, the Trial Court instead of closing their
right to file written statement should have granted
some time to the defendants subject to payment of
reasonable  amount  of  cost  to  the  plaintiff  to
compensate  the  inconvenience  caused  to  the
plaintiff.  The High Court was, therefore, right in
imposing a cost of Rs.11,250/- on the defendants to
be paid to the plaintiff as a pre-condition to file the
written statement within the extended time granted
by the High Court.
16)In  our  view,  here  comes  the  application  of
observations of Vivian Bose J. when His Lordship
said ""Too technical a construction of a section that
7leaves  no  room  for  reasonable  elasticity  of
interpretation should therefore be guarded against
(provided always that justice is done to both sides)
lest the very means designed for the furtherance of
justice be used to frustrate it. Our laws of procedure
are grounded on a principle of natural justice, which
requires  that  men  should  not  be  condemned
unheard, that decision should not be reached behind
their  back,  that  proceedings  that  affect  their  lives
and property should not continue in their absence
and  that  they  should  not  be  precluded  from
participating in them. "" 
17)Having observed this, His Lordship cautioned
""of course there must be exceptions too and where
they are clearly defined they must be given effect to”
and finally His Lordship concluded observing "" But
taken by and large, and subject to that proviso, our
laws  of  procedure  should  be  construed,  wherever
8that  is  reasonably  possible,  in  the  light  of  that
principle.""
18)The  approach  of  the  High  Court,  which
resulted in remand of the case to the Trial Court for
deciding  the  suit  on  merits  after  affording  full
opportunity to the defendants to contest the case
and, at the same time, making it obligatory to pay
cost of Rs.11,250/- to the plaintiff was, in our view,
in tune with the aforementioned observations and
did substantial justice to both the parties.
19)In view of foregoing discussion, we concur with
the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the
High Court and find no merit in the appeal. It is
accordingly dismissed.
20)We, however, find that none appeared for the
respondents  (defendants)  in  this  appeal  though
served. The Trial Court will now take up the suit to
its file and will issue notice of suit proceedings to
9the respondents/defendants for their appearance in
the suit.
21) On  their  entering  appearance  pursuant  to
service of fresh notice, the Trial Court will grant
them some time to deposit the cost amount fixed by
the  High  Court  and  also  to  file  their  written
statement. 
22)Failure to deposit the cost within the time fixed
so also the written statement would result in revival
of the decree passed by the Trial Court against the
defendants. 
23)In the event of defendants depositing the cost
and filing written statement as directed, the Trial
Court  will frame issues and  allow  the  parties  to
adduce  their  evidence  and  cross-examine  the
witnesses, who were already examined and will also
allow them to adduce additional evidence both oral
and documentary. 
1024)Let  the  trial  in  the  suit  be  over  within  six
months from the date of appearance of the parties.
The record of the case be sent back forthwith to the
Trial Court, if requisitioned here. 
25)The appellant (plaintiff) to appear before the
Trial Court on 3.10.2017 with the copy of this order
to enable the Trial Court to proceed in the trial of
the suit, as directed above.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
Civil Appeal  No(s).  26/2016
KRISHNA DEVI MAHESHWARI                            Appellant(s)
                                VERSUS
SURENDRA SUREKHA                                   Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
R. BANUMATHI, J. :
(1)We have heard Mr. V.C. Shukla, learned counsel appearing
for the appellant .
(2)The appellant-landlord filed the petition under Section
21(i)(a) of the U.P. Urban Building (Control of Letting of
Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 for release of the premises let
out  to  the  respondent-tenant  for  personal  use  of  the
appellant’s son who is practicing as an advocate.
(3)On 05.09.2012 the Prescribed Authority passed an ex-parte
order against the respondent-tenant.  There were number of
proceedings/applications  pending  between  the  appellant-
landlord  and  the  respondent-tenant.   Grievance  of  the
appellant-landlord  is  that  the  respondent-tenant  kept  on
taking adjournments by filing one after another applications
and thereby the matter could not be proceeded.
(4)The respondent’s application for setting aside the ex-
parte order of eviction dated 05.09.2012 was allowed by the
Prescribed Authority/ACMM-IX, Kanpur Nagar, on 20.08.2015 on2
payment of cost of Rs.2500/-.  Challenging the said order, the
appellant-landlord filed writ petition before the High Court
being C.M.W.P. No.48964 of 2015.  In the said writ petition,
the appellant-landlord filed an application under Order VI
Rule 17 read with Section 151 of C.P.C. before the High Court
to amend the prayer and to challenge the subsequent Order
dated 25.08.2015.  Vide impugned Order dated 15.09.2015, the
High Court disposed of C.M.W.P. No.48964 of 2015 by holding
that the rent court has set aside the ex-parte decree/order
and granted an opportunity to the respondent-land on payment
of cost of Rs.2500/-.  The said writ petition was disposed of
by the impugned order dated 15.09.2015 directing that none of
the parties to take unnecessary adjournments, which is the
subject matter of challenge in this appeal.
(5)In spite of notice, the respondent-tenant has not chosen
to appear and contest the appeal.
(6)Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and
having regard to the fact that an opportunity has been
provided  to  the  respondent-tenant  to  file  the  written
statement, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned
order. However, taking note of the conduct of the respondent-
tenant and the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct
the Rent Court-Prescribed Authority/ACMM-IX, Kanpur Nagar,
U.P., to take up Rent Case NO.1 of 2012 at an early date and
dispose of the same within a period of two months from the
date of receipt of copy of this order.  The respondent-tenant3
shall render all cooperation and in case the respondent-tenant
does not cooperate for an early disposal of Rent Case No.1 of
2012, as ordered by this Court, learned Rent Court/Prescribed
Authority shall proceed with the matter in accordance with the
law and dispose of the same within two months from the date of
receipt of copy of this Order, as indicated above.
(7)With the above direction, the civil appeal is accordingly
disposed of.  There shall be no orders as to costs.

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.1920 OF 2019 
ARISING OUT OF S.L.P.(CRIMINAL) NO. 10707 OF 2019 
KANWAR PAL SINGH .....APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
THE  STATE  OF  UTTAR  PRADESH  AND
ANOTHER.....
RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
SANJIV KHANNA, J.
Leave granted.
2.Kanwar Pal Singh, the appellant, impugns the order dated 22nd
July 2019 whereby the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad has
dismissed his petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure,  1973  (‘Code’  for  short)  for  quashing  criminal
prosecution under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(‘IPC’ for short), Rules 3, 57 and 7 of the Uttar Pradesh Minor
Mineral (Concession) Rules, 1963, Sections 4 and 21 of the Mines
and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,  1957 (‘Mines
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 1 of 17Regulation Act’ for short), and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention
of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 arising out of Crime Case
No. 289 of 2018, Police Station Vindyachal, District Mirzapur, Uttar
Pradesh.  The  appellant  had  also  challenged,  without  success
before the High Court, the order dated 8th February 2019 passed
by  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  taking  cognizance  and
summoning the appellant for trial.
3.In brief, the facts of the case are that on the basis of a complaint
filed by one Mr. S.K. Pal, Surveyor, Mines Department, District
Mirzapur, FIR No. 0289 dated 15th November 2018 was registered
at  Police  Station,  Vindyachal,  inter  alia recording  that  on  2nd
November 2018, during inspection of the mining site in Village
Nandni, Tehsil Sadar, District Mirzapur, the Nayab Tehsildar had
noticed illegal mining whereupon a report vide letter dated 12th
November 2018 was submitted to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate,
Sadar. The appellant is a Director of M/s. Kanwar Enterprises Pvt.
Ltd., which was granted rights to excavate sand vide mining lease
over  Plot  No.  2/4,  measuring  12.35  acre  and  Plot  No.  2/5
measuring 12.35 acre in Village Nandni. However, it is alleged that
the  appellant  was  mining  sand  outside  the  permitted  area  in
Village  Babhni  numbered  as  534/2  where  he  had  illegally
excavated a pit 50 feet long, 50 feet wide and 2 meter deep.
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 2 of 17Consequently, the District Magistrate had ordered for immediate
registration of the FIR under the aforesaid provisions .
4.Though a number of contentions were raised before the High
Court, the learned senior counsel for the appellant has during the
course of arguments before us restricted his submissions to the
violation of Section 22 of the Mines Regulation Act and the legal
effect thereof. Referring to the contents of the FIR, it is submitted
that the appellant has been wrongly charge-sheeted by the police
for the offences, as at the best there was violation of Section 4,
which is punishable under Section 21 of the Mines Regulation Act.
It is highlighted that M/s. Kanwar Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. had held a
valid  lease  for  mining.  As  per  Section  22  no  court  can  take
cognizance  of  the  offences  under  the  Mines  Regulation  Act,
except on a complaint in writing by a person authorised by the
Central  or  State  Government.  The  State  police  not  being
authorised, could not have filed the charge-sheet/complaint. The
contention predicated on Section 22 of the Mines Regulation Act is
made  by  relying  upon  the  judgment  of  this  Court  in  Jeewan
Kumar Raut and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation1.
In the written submissions filed by the appellant, a relatively new
plea  and  contention  has  been  raised  by  relying  upon  the
1 (2009) 7 SCC 526
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 3 of 17judgments of this Court in Belsund Sugar Company Limited  v.
State of Bihar ,2 Sharat Babu Digumarti v. Government of NCT
of Delhi3 and Suresh Nanda v. Central Bureau of Investigation4
to urge that the Mines Regulation Act being a special statute,
prosecution for an offence under Section 379 of the IPC would not
be maintainable. The judgment of this Court in  State (NCT of
Delhi) v. Sanjay.5, it is submitted, is distinguishable as the FIR for
the offence against illegal sand mining in  Sanjay (supra) was
registered  suo moto due to non-production of any document to
establish mining rights and therefore, the ratio in that case would
apply only to cases of illegal mining where the mining lease had
already been revoked or there was no subsisting mining lease.
5.We  find  the  submission  of  the  appellant  to  be  untenable.  In
Sanjay  (supra),  a  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  had  decided
appeals preferred against the conflicting judgments of the Delhi
High Court, Gujarat High Court, Kerala High Court, Calcutta High
Court,  Madras  High  Court  and  Jharkhand  High  Court  on  the
question whether a person can be prosecuted for the offences
under Sections 379/114 and other provisions of the IPC on the
2 (1999) 9 SCC 6203 (2017) 2 SCC 184 (2008) 3 SCC 6745 (2014) 9 SCC 772
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 4 of 17allegations of illegal mining in view of Section 22 of the Mines
Regulation Act, which reads as under:
“22.  Cognizance  of  offences.—  No  court  shall  take
cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act or any
rules  made  thereunder  except  upon  complaint  in  writing
made by a person authorised in this behalf by the Central
Government or the State Government.”
After adverting to the provisions of the Code, namely, Sections
2(c), 2(d) and 2(h) which define ‘cognizable offence’, ‘complaint’
and ‘investigation’ respectively, this Court had referred to Section
4 of the Code, which reads as under:  
“4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and
other laws.— (1) All offences under the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and
otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter
contained.
(2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated,
inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the
same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time
being  in  force  regulating  the  manner  or  place  of
investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with
such offences.”
As per sub-section (2) to Section 4, all offences under any law,
other than the IPC, can be investigated, inquired into and tried
under the Code, subject to any enactment regulating the manner
or place of investigation, trial etc. of such offences. Section 21 of
the  Mines  Regulation  Act,  it  was  observed,  states  that  the
offences specified thereunder are cognizable. Section 41 of the
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 5 of 17Code was referred to elucidate that the police has the power to
arrest without warrant in case of cognizable offences. Sections
149 to 152 of Chapter XI of the Code that require the police to
prevent cognizable offences either by arrest or otherwise, etc.
were referred, to hold that the aforementioned provisions show
that a police officer of his own authority has the duty to prevent
any injury attempted to be committed to any public property or
national assets and also to prosecute such persons in accordance
with law.
Accordingly, in Sanjay (supra) it was held that the investigation of
the offences is within the domain of the police and the power of a
police  officer  to  investigate  into  cognizable  offences  is  not
ordinarily  impinged  by  any  fetters  albeit  the  power  must  be
exercised  as  per  the  statutory  provisions  and  for  legitimate
purposes. The courts would interfere only when while examining
the  case  they  find  that  the  police  officer  in  exercise  of  the
investigatory powers has breached the statutory provisions and
put the personal liberty and/or the property of a citizen in jeopardy
by  an  illegal  and  improper  use  of  the  powers  or  when  the
investigation by the police is not found to be bona fide or when the
investigation is tainted with animosity. While examining the issue,
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 6 of 17this Court in  Sanjay (supra) took notice of the decision in  H.N.
Rishbud v. State of Delhi6 wherein this Court has held that a
defect or illegality in investigation, however serious, has no direct
bearing on the competence or the procedure relating to the taking
of the cognizance or trial. The cardinal principle of law as noted by
this Court in Directorate of Enforcement v. Deepak Mahajan7 is
that every law is designed to further the ends of justice and should
not be frustrated on mere technicalities. The public trust doctrine
was cited  and applied to underscore the  principle  that certain
resources like air, sea, water, forests and minerals are of great
importance to the people as a whole and that the government is
enjoined to hold such resources in trust for the benefit of the
general public and to use them for their benefit than to serve
private interests. 
6.This Court in Sanjay (supra) has cited several decisions wherein
the challenge to the prosecution on the ground that there can be
no multiplicity of offences under different enactments was resolved
and answered by relying upon Section 26 of the General Clauses
Act,  which  we  would  like  to  reproduce  for  the  sake  of
convenience:
6 AIR 1955 SC 1967 (1994) 3 SCC 440
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 7 of 17“26. Provision as to offences punishable under two or
more  enactments.—  Where  an  act  or  omission
constitutes an offence under two or more enactments, then
the offender shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished
under either or any of those enactments, but shall not be
liable to be punished twice for the same offence.”
Section 26 of the General Clauses Act permits prosecution for
‘different offences’ but bars prosecution and punishment twice for
the ‘same offence’ under two or more enactments. The expression
‘same offence’ has been interpreted by this Court in numerous
decisions  viz.,  Maqbool  Hussain  v.  State  of  Bombay8 with
reference  to  the  provisions  of  the  Sea  Customs  Act  and  the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947;  Om Parkash Gupta  v.
State of U.P.9 and State of Madhya Pradesh v. Veereshwar Rao
Agnihotri10 with reference to Section 409 of the IPC and Section
5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act; T.S. Baliah v. ITO11 with
reference to Section 52 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 and Section
177 of the IPC;  Collector of Customs  v.  Vasantraj Bhagwanji
Bhatia12, with reference to the provisions of the Customs Act 1962
and the provisions of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968; State of Bihar
v. Murad Ali Khan13 with reference to the provisions of Sections
447,  429  and  379  of  the  IPC  and  provisions  of  the  Wildlife
8 AIR 1953 SC 3259 AIR 1957 SC 45810 AIR 1957 SC 59211 AIR 1969 SC 70112 (1988) 3 SCC 46713 (1988) 4 SCC 655
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 8 of 17(Protection)  Act,  1972;  Avtar  Singh  v.  State  of  Punjab14 with
reference  to  Section  39  of  the  Electricity  Act,  1910  and  the
provisions of theft under the IPC; and  Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India v. Vimal Kumar Surana15 with reference to
the  provisions  of  the  Chartered  Accountants  Act,  1949  and
offences  under  Sections  419,  468,  471  and  472  of  the  IPC.
Elucidating on the provisions of Section 4 read with Sections 21
and 22 of the Mines Regulation Act and the offence under Section
379 of the IPC, it was observed in Sanjay (supra):  
“69.  Considering  the  principles  of  interpretation  and  the
wordings used in Section 22, in our considered opinion, the
provision  is  not  a  complete  and  absolute  bar  for  taking
action by the police for illegal and dishonestly committing
theft of minerals including sand from the riverbed. The Court
shall take judicial notice of the fact that over the years rivers
in  India  have  been  affected  by  the  alarming  rate  of
unrestricted sand mining which is damaging the ecosystem
of  the  rivers  and  safety  of  bridges.  It  also  weakens
riverbeds, fish breeding and destroys the natural habitat of
many organisms. If these illegal activities are not stopped by
the State and the police authorities of the State, it will cause
serious repercussions as mentioned hereinabove. It will not
only change the river hydrology but also will deplete the
groundwater levels.
70. There cannot be any dispute with regard to restrictions
imposed under the MMDR Act and remedy provided therein.
In any case, where there is a mining activity by any person
in contravention of the provisions of Section 4 and other
sections of the Act, the officer empowered and authorised
under the Act shall exercise all the powers including making
a complaint before the Jurisdictional Magistrate. It is also
not in dispute that the Magistrate shall in such cases take
14 AIR 1965 SC 66615 (2011) 1 SCC 534
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 9 of 17cognizance on the basis of the complaint filed before it by a
duly authorised officer. In case of breach and violation of
Section 4 and other provisions of the Act, the police officer
cannot insist the Magistrate for taking cognizance under the
Act  on  the  basis  of  the  record  submitted  by  the  police
alleging contravention of the said Act. In other words, the
prohibition  contained  in  Section  22  of  the  Act  against
prosecution of a person except on a complaint made by the
officer is attracted only when such person is sought to be
prosecuted for contravention of Section 4 of the Act and not
for any act or omission which constitutes an offence under
the Penal Code.
71.  However,  there  may  be  a  situation  where  a  person
without any lease or licence or any authority enters into river
and extracts sand, gravel and other minerals and remove or
transport those minerals in a clandestine manner with an
intent  to  remove  dishonestly  those  minerals  from  the
possession  of  the  State,  is  liable  to  be  punished  for
committing such offence under Sections 378 and 379 of the
Penal Code.
72. From a close reading of the provisions of the MMDR Act
and  the  offence  defined  under  Section  378  IPC,  it  is
manifest that the ingredients constituting the offence are
different.  The  contravention  of  terms  and  conditions  of
mining lease or doing mining activity in violation of Section
4 of the Act is an offence punishable under Section 21 of
the MMDR Act, whereas dishonestly removing sand, gravel
and other minerals from the river, which is the property of
the State, out of the State’s possession without the consent,
constitute  an  offence  of  theft.  Hence,  merely  because
initiation of proceeding for commission of an offence under
the MMDR Act on the basis of complaint cannot and shall
not debar the police from taking action against persons for
committing  theft  of  sand  and  minerals  in  the  manner
mentioned above by exercising power under the Code of
Criminal  Procedure  and  submit  a  report  before  the
Magistrate for taking cognizance against such persons. In
other words, in a case where there is a theft of sand and
gravel from the government land, the police can register a
case, investigate the same and submit a final report under
Section 173 CrPC before a Magistrate having jurisdiction for
the purpose of taking cognizance as provided in Section
190(1)(d) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”
      (emphasis supplied)
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 10 of 177.As noticed above, in the written submissions the appellant has
relied upon Belsund Sugar Company Limited  (supra), Sharat
Babu Digumarti  (supra) and Suresh Nanda  (supra) to contend
that where there is a special act dealing with a special subject,
resort cannot be taken to a general act.  The said submission has
no force in view of the ratio in  Sanjay (supra) as quoted above
which specifically refers to Section 26 of the General Clauses Act
and states that the offence under Section 4 read with Section 21
of  the  Mines  Regulation  Act  is  different  from  the  offence
punishable under Section 379 of the IPC. Thus, they are two
‘different’ and not the ‘same offence’. It would be relevant to state
here that the Delhi High Court in its decision reported as Sanjay
v. State16, which was impugned in Sanjay (supra), had accepted
an identical argument to hold that once an offence is punishable
under Section 21 of the Mines Regulation Act, the offence would
not be punishable under Section 379 of the IPC. This reasoning
was rejected by this Court and the judgment of the Delhi High
Court  was  reversed.  The  contention  relying  on  the  same
reasoning before us, therefore, must be rejected. 
8.We would also reject the contention raised by the appellant in the
16 (2009) 109 DRJ 594
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 11 of 17written submissions that the alleged theft of sand is not punishable
under Section 379 read with Section 378 of the IPC as sand is an
immovable property as per Section 3 (26) of the General Clauses
Act.  In  the  present  case,  sand  had  been  excavated  and  was
thereupon no longer an immovable property. The sand on being
excavated would lose its attachment to the earth, ergo, it is a
movable  property  or  goods  capable  of  being  stolen.  {See
Explanation 1 to Section 378 of the IPC and  Sanjay  (supra) as
quoted above}
9.We would in the end refer to the judgment in  Jeewan Kumar
Raut (supra) on which considerable reliance was placed by the
appellant  at  the  time  of  the  hearing.  The  said  judgment  was
distinguished in  Institute of Chartered Accountants  (supra) by
observing that the provisions of the Transplantation of Human
Organs Act, 1994 (‘TOHO Act’ for short) were different and were
not similar to the provisions of sub-section 2 to Section 24-A, 25
and 26 of the Chartered Accountants Act as the TOHO Act is
hedged  with  a  non-obstante clause.  We  would  like  to  further
elucidate and explain that in  Jeewan Kumar Raut  (supra) this
Court was examining the right of the appellant therein to claim
statutory bail in terms of sub-section (2) to Section 167 of the
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 12 of 17Code on the ground that the Central Bureau of Investigation (‘CBI’
for short) had failed to file the charge-sheet within 90 days from
the date of arrest. Relying on Section 22 of the TOHO Act, which
mandates filing of a complaint by a person duly authorised by a
competent  authority,  it  was  observed  that  the  TOHO  Act  is  a
special law which deals with the subjects mentioned therein, viz.,
offences relating to the removal of human organs, etc.  Ordinarily,
any person can set the criminal law into motion but the legislature
keeping in view the sensitivity and importance of the subject had
provided that the violations under the TOHO Act would be dealt
with by the authorities specified therein. Thereafter, reference was
made to Section 4 of the Code as cited above, to hold that the
TOHO Act being a special Act, the matters relating to offences
covered thereunder would be governed by the provisions of said
Act,  which  would  prevail  over  the  provisions  of  the  Code.
Reference was made to clause (iv) of sub-section (3) to Section
13 of the TOHO Act which states that the appropriate authority
shall investigate any complaint of breach of any of the provisions
of the said Act or any rules made thereunder and take appropriate
action. There is no similar provision under the Mines Regulation
Act i.e. the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)
Act, 1957.
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 13 of 1710.In  Jeewan Kumar Raut  (supra), it was noted that the CBI has
been designated as an appropriate authority under the provisions
of the TOHO Act and therefore entitled to carry on investigation. In
this context, it was observed that Section 22 of the TOHO Act
prohibits taking of cognizance except on a complaint made by an
appropriate authority and therefore the police report filed by the
CBI  was  only  a  complaint  petition  made  by  an  appropriate
authority in terms of Section 22 of the TOHO Act.  Consequently,
sub-section (2) to Section 167 of the Code would not be attracted
as the CBI could not have submitted a police report in terms of
sub-section (2) to Section 173 of the Code. Jeewan Kumar Raut
(supra) was, thus, dealing with a contention and issue entirely
different from the one raised in the present case. It is undisputed
that decisions of the courts cannot be blindly applied in disjunction
of the factual circumstances and issues of each case. The court
decisions  expound  on  the  law  as  applicable  to  the  specific
circumstances  of  each  case  and  such  exposition  may  not
therefore be necessarily applicable to another case given its own
peculiarities. Therefore, the contention predicated on the ratio in
Jeewan Kumar Raut  (supra) holds no merit.
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 14 of 1711.We would again advert to the decision in  Sanjay  (supra) which
had overruled the decision of the Calcutta High Court in  Seema
Sarkar v. State17 wherein the High Court held the proceedings to
be invalid and illegal as the Magistrate had taken cognizance on
the basis of a charge-sheet submitted by the police under Section
21(2) of the Mines Regulation Act and Section 379 of the IPC,
observing that the cognizance was one that cannot be split or
divided.  The  High  Court  had  further  observed  that  as  the
complaint was not made in terms of Section 22 of the Mines
Regulation Act, the cognizance was bad and contrary to law.  We
have already noted the decision of the Delhi High Court which had
directed that the FIR should not be treated as registered under
Section 379 of the IPC but only under Section 21 of the Mines
Regulation Act. These decisions of the Calcutta High Court and
the Delhi High Court were reversed and set aside by this Court in
Sanjay  (supra)  after  referring  to  Section  26  of  the  General
Clauses Act and the meaning of the expression ‘same offence’, to
observe that the offence under Section 21 read with Section 4 of
the Mines Regulation Act and Section 379 of the IPC are different
and distinct. The aforesaid reasoning compels us to reject the
contention of the appellant that the action as impugned in the FIR
17 (1995) 1 Cal LT 95
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 15 of 17is a mere violation of Section 4 which is an offence cognizable
only under Section 21 of the Mines Regulation Act and not under
any  other  law.  There  is  no  bar  on  the  Court  from  taking
cognizance  of  the  offence  under  Section  379  of  the  IPC.  We
would  also  observe  that  the  violation  of  Section  4  being  a
cognizable offence, the police could have always investigated the
same, there being no bar under the Mines Regulation Act, unlike
Section 13(3)(iv) of the TOHO Act. 
12.In view of the aforesaid discussion, we would uphold the order of
the  High  Court  refusing  to  set  aside  the  prosecution  and
cognizance of the offence taken by the learned Magistrate under
Section 379 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of
Damage to Public Property Act. We would, however, clarify that
prosecution and cognizance under Section 21 read with Section 4
of the Mines Regulation Act will not be valid and justified in the
absence of the authorisation. Further, our observations in deciding
and answering the legal issue before us should not be treated as
findings on the factual allegations made in the complaint. The trial
court would independently apply its mind to the factual allegations
and decide the charge in accordance with law. In light of the
aforesaid observations, the appeal is partly allowed, as we have
Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10707 of 2019 Page 16 of 17upheld  the  prosecution  and  cognizance  of  the  offence  under
Section 379 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of
Damage to Public Property Act. There would be no order as to
costs.

5.As per his date of arrest, 90 days prior thereto was to expire
on 16th December, 2017.  On 11th December, 2017, the Special

assigning specific reasons, praying for the extension of judicial
detention of the accused respondent for a further period of 90
days   to   enable   the   investigating   agency   to   complete   the
investigation.   The written objections were filed by the accused

dismissed vide Order dated 18th  January, 2018 having become
infructuous. 
7.Aggrieved   by   the   aforesaid   orders   dated   12th  December,
2017 & 18th  January, 2018, the accused respondent(A­3) filed
appeal under Section 21 of the National Investigation Agency Act,
2008 before the High Court.   The High Court of Madras, on
appraisal of the record, arrived at the conclusion that the specific
reasons   which   have   been   assigned   by   the   Special   Public
Prosecutor in his report seeking extension of time does not meet
the requirement of law as contemplated under Section 43D(2)(b)
of the UAP Act, 1967 and accordingly set aside the order of the
Special Court dated 12th December, 2017 and 18th January, 2018
and in consequence thereof, granted statutory bail in default to
the respondent accused under its Order dated 12th  September,
2018 which is a subject matter of challenge in appeals before us.
48.As informed to this Court, that (A­1) Haja Fakkurudeen has
been absconding but charge­sheet has been filed against all the
accused persons and Khaja Moideen @ Abdullah Muthalif(A­2)
was arrested on 15th  September, 2017 and bail was granted to
him on 23rd January, 2019 and Ansar Meeran(A­4) was arrested
on 12th  February, 2018 and bail was granted to him on 19th

under Section 228 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.   The
case against A­5 to A­7 has been closed by NIA. 
9.Learned counsel for the appellant submits that Paras 8 to
12 of the report of Special Public Prosecutor indicate specific
reasons   like   need   for   further   NIA   custody   of   the   accused   as
envisaged in Section 43D(2) of the UAP Act, 1967, to verify the
facts revealed through experts and for unravelling the conspiracy
in the case for the detention of the accused respondent for a
further period of 90 days and once the satisfaction was recorded
by   the   learned   Judge   of   Special   Court   meeting   out   the
requirements envisaged under Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAP Act,
1967, such satisfaction recorded after perusal of the record could

5reasons were forthcoming, which has not been pointed out under
the impugned judgment.   
10.Per contra, while supporting the order of the High Court,
learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   submits   that   though   the
reasons have been assigned by the Special Public Prosecutor in
his report which may be relevant for further investigation, but
was   not   relevant   to   justify   further   detention   of   the   accused
respondent for a further period of 90 days and that being the
mandate of law as envisaged in Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAP Act,
1967, no error was committed by the High Court in setting aside
the order of the Special Court under the impugned judgment.
11.Learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   in   alternate   further
submits that the detention of the accused respondent might have
been necessary at the relevant point of time for further progress
of the investigation but the fact situation has later changed and
the co­accused persons who are similarly situated(A­2) & (A­4)
have been granted bail on 23rd January, 2019 and 19th November,
2018 on merits by the competent Court of jurisdiction after filing
of the charge­sheet and in either of the order of bail granted to
6the   accused   nos.   2   and   4,   prosecution   has   not   filed   any
application for cancellation. The present accused respondent(A­3)
is also on bail may be in compliance of the impugned judgment
and when it is not the case of the appellant that after statutory
bail was granted to him in compliance of the impugned judgment
dated 12th  September, 2018, he has committed any breach or
violated the conditions of the bail granted to him.  At least, in the
given facts and circumstances, even if there is some merit in the
submission made by the appellant, at least the bail which was
granted   to   the   accused   respondent   in   the   changed
circumstances, may not be interfered with by this Court.
12.It is not disputed that in the instant cases, the accused
respondent(A­3) was arrested on 18th September, 2017 and initial
period of 90 days from the date of arrest was to expire on 16th
December, 2017 and prior thereto on 11th December, 2017, the
report was submitted by the Special Public Prosecutor assigning
specific reasons for seeking detention of the accused respondent

7counsel and after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties,
the Special Court, after recording its satisfaction, in reference to
the   specific   reasons   assigned   for   detention   of   the   accused
respondent beyond a period of 90 days allowed the application
filed by the Special Public Prosecutor vide its order dated 12th
December, 2017.
13.The extract of the report submitted by the Public Prosecutor
indicating   the   progress   of   the   investigation   and   the   specific
reasons required for detention of the accused respondent for a
further period of 90 days as envisaged under Section 43D of the
UAP Act are stated as under:­
8.It   is   further   submitted   that   the   investigation   is
continued the facts disclosed by the accused while on
custody needs further verification and in progress.  The
electronic gadgets seized at the instance of the accused
needs to be forensically analysed.   In this regard the
electronic gadgets seized from accused were forwarded
to C­DAC, Thiruvananthapuram, through this Hon’ble
Court, needs to be analysed by the experts of C­DAC,
Thiruvananthapuram   and   report   yet   to   be   received.
The accused persons may be required for further police
custody   from   judicial   custody   for   the   purpose   of
investigation as envisaged in Section 43D(2)(b) of UAP
Act, 1967 to verify any facts being obtained from the
forensic expert.
9.It is further submitted that investigation against the
absconding accused Haja Fakkurudeen(A­1), who had
joined the activities of ISIS in Syria, and other accused
named in the FIR are in progress.  The travel details of
the   accused   are   being   verified   through   Immigration
8authorities to confirm the complicity of the accused
tour and travels to Syria and other places.  A number
of witnesses acquainted with facts of the case are yet to
be examined and the investigation period beyond 90
days if not expended, it may cause serious prejudice
and   enlarging   accused   Khaja   Mohideen   (A­2)   and
Shakul Hameed (A­3) on bail at this stage may hamper
the investigation also.
10.It   is   submitted   that   the   NIA   is   conducting
investigation   abroad,   on   the   role   of   accused   and
associates operating from abroad in this case.  In this
regard   requests   have   been   send   to   the   Republic   of
Singapore   under   Mutual   Legal   Assistance
Treaty(MLAT)   between   Republic   of   India   and   the
Republic of Singapore and the reply on certain aspects
are   yet   to   be   received   from   the   requested   country.
Further, the process of sending request to the United
States of America(USA) under Mutual Legal Assistance
Treaty(MLAT) between Republic of India and USA to get
the   details   of   social   media   accounts   and
communications between accused and their associates
in India and abroad is under progress.
11.It is further submitted that the NIA has taken
steps to unravel the larger conspiracy including the
clandestine   terror   activities   of   the   accused,   their
association   with   other   terrorist   organizations,   their
possible locations in India and abroad and the sources
of funding etc.  Besides, requisitions were sent to the
concerned service providers to get the CDR’s of all the
mobile phones recovered and the other numbers used
by the accused with a view to analyse the same for
establishing   the   linkages   between   the   absconding
accused and field verification needs to be done.   The
names accused in the FIR is yet to be secured and the
involvements   of   those   persons   have   also   been
investigated and investigation is in crucial stage and
therefore it is not possible to complete the investigation
within the said period of ninety days.   Therefore, as
indicated   the   progress   of   the   investigation   and   the
specific reasons above for the detention of the accused
beyond the said period of ninety days extend the said
period   up   to   one   hundred   and   eighty   days   for   the
purpose of investigation.
12.It is further submitted that the investigation is
proceeding in the right direction.   Since the accused
9are   hard   core   ISIS   ideologists,   detailed   further
interrogation is inevitable to collect more evidence and
for unravelling the larger conspiracy behind the crime.
There may be imminent threat to the security of the
nation if the accused are not interrogated in detail,
more   evidence   is   not   collected   and   detailed
investigation is not done to identify and secure other
members of the group.” 
14.Before we proceed to examine the question raised in the
instant appeal any further, it may be apposite to take note of
Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAP Act, 1967:­
“43D.Modified application of certain provisions of the

report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the progress
of the investigation and the specific reasons for the

investigation under this Act, requests, for the purposes
of   investigation,   for   police   custody   from   judicial

an affidavit stating the reasons for doing so and shall

17.Taking   note   of   the   specific   reasons   which   have   been
assigned by the Special Public Prosecutor in his report of which
reference has been made(supra), we are satisfied that the specific
11reasons assigned by the Public Prosecutor fulfil the mandate and
requirement of Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAP Act, 1967 and that
was considered by the learned Judge of the Special Court in
detail, who after recording its satisfaction, granted detention to
the accused for a further period of 90 days under its Order dated
12th December, 2017.  
18.We cannot be oblivious of the changed circumstances which
has been brought to our notice regarding the present FIR dated
26th January, 2017.  Charge­sheet has been filed against all the

any breach or violated the conditions of grant of bail.

arrived at by the High Court in the impugned judgment dated
1212th September, 2018 but taking note of the later developments

inclined to interfere with the final relief to the extent of granting
default bail to the accused respondent in the circumstances of
the case on hand.  However, it may be open for the prosecution to
apply for cancellation of bail, if any exigency arises in future.  We
consider it further to direct the learned Presiding Officer of the

enormous loss occurred in demolition of their
juggies,  which  had  been  demolished
arbitrarily  without  their  adequate
rehabilitation/relocation.”
4.These writ petitions were disposed of by a common
judgment dated 11.02.2010.  The operative portion of
the judgment contained in paragraphs 62 to 64, reads
as follows:-
“62.It is declared that :
(i) The decision of the respondents holding
that the petitioners are on the “Right of
Way” and are, therefore, not entitled to
relocation, is hereby declared as illegal and
unconstitutional.
(ii)  In  terms  of  the  extant  policy  for
relocation  of  jhuggi  dwellers,  which  is
operational in view of the orders of the
Supreme Court, the cases of the petitioners
will be considered for relocation.
(iii) Within a period of four months from
today,  each  of  those  eligible  among  the
petitioners, in terms of the above relocation
policy, will be granted an alternative  site
as per MPD-2021 subject to proof of residence
prior to cut-off date. This will happen in
consultation  with  each  of  them  in  a
'meaningful' manner, as indicated in this
judgment.
(iv) The State agencies will ensure that
basic civic amenities, consistent with the
2rights to life and dignity of each of the
citizens in the jhuggies, are available at
the site of relocation.
63.With  the  above  directions,  these
petitions are allowed.
64.A certified copy of this order be sent
to the Member Secretary, Delhi Legal Services
Authority (DLSA) with the request that wide
publicity be given to the operative portion
and directions of this judgment in the local
language  among  the  residents  of  jhuggi
clusters in the city as well as in the
relocated sites. The DLSA will also hold
periodical camps in jhuggi clusters and in
relocated sites to make the residents aware
of their rights. A copy of this order be also
sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of
National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi,  for
compliance.”
5.It is also relevant to note the opening paragraph
of the judgment, which reads as follows:-
“1.The writ petitions have been filed under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India
seeking  intervention  of  this  Court  to
rehabilitate and relocate the petitioners who
were residing at various slum clusters in the
Capital  city  to  a  suitable  place  and
providing  them  alternative  land  with
ownership rights pursuant to demolition of
their ‘jhuggies’ (hutments).  The subject
matter in these four writ petitions revolves
around questions of great importance, inter
3alia, right to shelter of the petitioners and
those represented by them on one hand, and,
on the other, slum cluster being on ‘Right of
Way’ on which basis the agencies of the State
seek to oppose them.  Thereafter, all of them
were taken up together for hearing and are
being disposed of by this common judgment.”
6.We feel it also apposite to refer to the opening
paragraph  of  the  writ  petition,  which  reads  as
follows:-
“That the petitioners are filing this
Writ Petition on behalf of all the residents
of  New  Sanjay  Camp  Slum  Cluster  whose
jhuggies  were  demolished  by  the  PWD  on
05.02.09 on the ground of making underpass on
road no.13 (Okhla estate marg) which goes
through Okhla Phase-I and Phase-II without
even ensuring that the poor slum dwellers of
the  jhuggies,  who  were  eligible
for  rehabilitation/resettlement,  were
rehabilitated or relocated on/to some other
sites.   The  petitioners,  by  way  of  the
present Writ Petition, are seeking proper
resettlement of the residents in accordance
with  the  Rehabilitation  and  Improvement
Scheme for Jhuggi Clusters, 2000 framed by
the Delhi Government and the Master Plan for
Delhi-2021.  The jhuggies of the petitioners
and the other residents of the New Sanjay
Camp Slum Cluster were demolished in total
contravention of their fundamental right of
4Right to Shelter under Article 21 of the
Constitution, the International Conventions
and Principles of Natural Justice.  It is
further submitted that the said jhuggies were
demolished in absolute violation of the Delhi
Govt’s Rehabilitation & Improvement Scheme
for Jhuggi Clusters, which came into effect
from 01.04.2000.”
7.We are informed that a review was attempted by
the respondents and the same was dismissed.  Though,
a special leave petition was also filed but the same
was withdrawn.
8.Be that as it may, since the judgment was not
complied with in its letter and spirit, the writ
petitioners approached the High Court invoking its
contempt jurisdiction.
9.The High Court, as per the impugned judgment, has
taken a view that only the actual affected writ
petitioners are entitled to the benefits by way of
rehabilitation.  Paragraphs 12 to 14 contain the
relevant consideration, which read as follows:-
“12.  I  have  carefully  considered  the
submissions made by the respective sides.  I
have also gone through the record.  In my
considered opinion, no doubt there were two
sets of persons and the writ petition was
filed  in  the  nature  of  public  interest
litigation.  This is evident from para 1 of
5the judgment where the court has taken note
of the petitioners and the persons to whom
they represent but while giving the benefit,
it has confined the said benefit only to the
petitioners and not to other persons.  This
clearly shows that the court intended to draw
a distinction between the petitioners and the
non-petitioners, whose names are given to the
court as annexures to the writ petition.
13.In  my  view  the  use  of  the  word
‘petitioners’ confines this benefit only to
the four petitioners and not to any other
person even though the petitioners may intend
to refer to the same.  Moreover, none of the
persons, whose names are mentioned in the
list, have come forward to raise a grievance
that  they  have  not  been  considered  or
allotted an alternative accommodation.
14.In the light of the aforesaid fact, I
feel that the present contempt petition is
totally  misconceived  and  accordingly,  the
same deserves to be dismissed.”
10.Heard  Mr.  Prashant  Bhushan,  learned  counsel
appearing for the appellants and Mr. A.N.S. Nadkarni,
learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for
the respondents.
11.In  our  view,  the  High  Court  went  wrong  in
referring only to paragraph 62 of the judgment and
not to the other relevant considerations leading to
the decision which are contained in the judgment
itself, which we have extracted above.  The whole
6purpose of paragraph 62 of the judgment is to lend
the benefit of the judgment to the affected persons
whose names have been furnished in the writ petitions
in  the  form  of  annexures  to  the  petitions.
Paragraphs 63 and 64 in fact makes it very clear. It
is not required that in a public interest litigation
all the affected parties should be petitioners.  It
is a well-accepted principle of class litigation.  In
the facts of the present case, the petitioners have
actually furnished the names of persons who have been
identified as the persons affected.  Hence the High
Court ought to have extended the benefit to those
persons whose names have also been furnished by way
of annexures to the writ petitions and for whose
benefits the High Court has rendered the judgment
dated 11.02.2010.  As rightly pointed out by learned
Additional Solicitor General, the eligibility of the
persons referred to in the Annexures will have to be
verified and that is what is precisely indicated by
the Court in direction No.3 to the effect that the
benefit should be available to those eligible persons
in terms of the relocation policy. 
12.The respondents are directed to implement the
judgment in the light of the clarification we have
given in this judgment.  The needful be done within a
period of three months from today.
713.The appeals are allowed to the extent indicated
above.
14.Pending  applications,  if  any,  shall  stand
disposed of.
15.There shall be no orders as to costs.

  REPORTABLE
   IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
  CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO.2500 OF 2017
Manmohan Attavar              ...Appellants
Versus
Neelam Manmohan Attavar        …Respondents
    WITH
                  CIVIL APPEAL NO.2502 OF 2017
J U D G M E N T
SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J .
1.The appellant is 84 years old and the respondent is 62 years
old.  The  respondent  seeks  to  establish  her  status  as  the
wife/companion of the appellant who has been left high and dry
by  the  appellant  while  on  the  other  hand  the  appellant
categorically denies any such status. 
2.The admitted facts are that the respondent was married to2
one Shri Harish Chander Chhabra. That marriage did not work
out and ultimately a consent decree for divorce was obtained on
10.10.1996.  Even  in  the  interregnum  period,  the  respondent
claims  to  have  developed  a  relationship  with  the  appellant
starting from their introduction in 1987. It is her case that there
was continuous interaction between the two and the appellant
even proposed to her in December 1993. The appellant earned a
National Award on 16.10.1996. The respondent also claims to
have been requested to travel with the appellant to Bangalore on
30.10.1996.  The appellant’s wife was alive when the respondent
claims  that  the  appellant  took  her  to  No.38/1,  Jayanagar,
Bengaluru  and  that  the  appellant’s  wife  was  apparently  also
aware  of  the  relationship  between  the  two  parties.  The
respondent claims that she resigned from the job with ICAR at
the behest of the appellant. On 10.1.1998, the respondent claims
that the appellant applied “kumkum” to her forehead and soon
thereafter he was conferred with the Padma Shri Award and the
respondent  accompanied  the  appellant  for  the  felicitation
ceremony on 21.3.1998. 
3.It  is  the  respondent’s  claim  that  from  2002-2008  the
respondent was made to stay in different residences hired by the
appellant. But apparently the relationship soured. The endeavors3
for  reconciliation,  however,  did  not  succeed.  The  wife  of  the
appellant was incidentally alive at that time and she passed away
on 22.2.2010. The endeavor, prior to this, by the respondent
seeking remedy for what she claims to be her neglect, through
the Women and Child Welfare Department of State of Karnataka,
also did not succeed. 
4.The  respondent  claims  to  have  made  various  efforts  by
approaching authorities and high dignitaries apart from police
authorities but to no avail.
5.The respondent initiated proceedings under Section 12 of
The  Protection  of  Women  from  Domestic  Violence  Act,  2005
(hereinafter  referred to  as ‘the  D.V. Act’) on  16.9.2013  being
Criminal Misc. Petition No.179 of 2013. This case is stated to
have been re-numbered as Crl. Misc. Application No.139 of 2015.
The  endeavor  of  the  appellant  seeking  quashing  of  these
proceedings before the High Court vide Criminal Writ Petition
No.6126/2013  under  Section  482  of  the  Criminal  Procedure
Code,  1973  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Cr.P.C.)  did  not
succeed and petition was dismissed on 2.1.2015. The trial went
on and at the request of the respondent made under Section 410
of the Cr.P.C., the application was transferred from the Court of4
the  Metropolitan  Magistrate–VI  to  the  Court  of  Metropolitan
Magistrate-II at Bangalore. This application was finally dismissed
by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate on 30.7.2015. 
6.The respondent, aggrieved by the said order, filed Criminal
Appeal  No.1070/2015  under  Section  29  of  the  D.V.  Act  on
18.8.2015 which  was  assigned  to  the  learned Addl.  Sessions
Judge presiding over Court 67. The interim relief prayed for in
this petition was, however, rejected by the learned Addl. Sessions
Judge on 5.11.2015. 
7.The respondent again sought a transfer from that court and
the appeal was transferred to the Court of the learned Additional
Sessions  Judge  presiding  over  Court  No.53  vide  order  dated
16.2.2016. A second application was filed by the respondent for
stay  of  the  impugned  order  for  interim  maintenance.  The
respondent  was  once  again  aggrieved  by  the  conduct  of  the
proceedings during the hearing of the interim application and
submitted a complaint to the High Court of Karnataka.  In terms
of an administrative order of the Registrar General of the High
Court, the application was called upon to be decided on or before
30.4.2016. The application was rejected on 21.4.2016 as being
not maintainable. The applications filed for additional evidence5
by the respondent also met an adverse fate. 
8.It is in the aforesaid scenario that the respondent filed Writ
petition No.49153 of 2016 under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India before the High Court of Karnataka praying
for the transfer of Criminal Appeal No.1070 of 2015 to the High
Court itself on the ground that the order for rejection of the
applications for additional evidence did not inspire faith. 
9.Learned Single Judge of the High Court by an ex-parte order
dated 19.9.2016, while issuing notice in the petition, stayed all
further proceedings and permitted the respondent to occupy the
premises  No.38/1, 30th Cross, 3rd Main, 7th Block Jayanagar,
Bengaluru, 560082 belonging to the appellant. This interim order
is  subject  matter  of  challenge  before  us  in  SLP  (C)  No.
32783/2016 now numbered as Civil Appeal No.2500 of 2017.
10.On service being effected on the appellant, the writ petition
was opposed along with the prayer for vacation of the  ex-parte
order. It is the case of the appellant that instead of deciding the
Interlocutory Application, the appellant was compelled to pay a
lump sum amount of Rs.30,000/- as a onetime payment. This
order is stated to have been challenged in SLP No.33150 of 2016.
In fact the declining of interim relief by the appellate court was6
not even specifically challenged before the High Court and yet the
High Court granted an ex parte order.
11.Learned  Single  Judge  vide  the  subsequent  order  dated
24.10.2016 sought to withdraw the appeal proceedings from the
learned Addl. Sessions Judge to the High Court itself and this
order has been assailed in SLP No.32534/2016 now numbered
as Civil Appeal No.2502 of 2017.
12.We have heard the contentions of the learned senior counsel
for the appellant and have also heard the respondent appearing
in person, quite elaborately. Written submissions were filed both
by the appellant and by the respondent. We have noticed that a
large part of the submissions of the respondent relate to the
merits of the claim as to why the learned Metropolitan Magistrate
fell  into  error  while  dismissing  the  application  filed  by  the
respondent on 30.7.2015 under Section 12 of the D.V. Act.
13.We may note at this stage itself that it would neither be
advisable  nor  proper  to  dwell  into  the  controversy  on  merits
because the appeal filed by the respondent is yet to be decided.
Any observations by us at this stage could affect either of the
parties in the appeal proceedings. The controversy before us is in
a very narrow compass. We thus set forth the controversy -7
(i)Whether  an  interim  order  could  have  been  passed  on
19.9.2016  permitting  the  respondent  to  occupy  the
premises of the appellant;
(ii)Whether the learned Single Judge was right in withdrawing
the proceedings pending before the learned Addl. Sessions
Judge to the High Court vide the impugned order dated
24.10.2016.
14.Insofar as the first question is concerned, reliance has been
placed by the respondent on the provisions of the D.V. Act and
the desirability to construe the provisions liberally in favour of
women seeking relief, as it is in the nature of a social legislation
meant for protection of women’s rights. In order to appreciate the
controversy, we reproduce the relevant provisions as under:-
“17. Right to reside in a shared household .-
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other
law  for  the  time  being  in  force,  every  woman  in  a
domestic relationship shall have the right to reside in
the shared household, whether or not she has any
right, title or beneficial interest in the same. 
(2)  The  aggrieved  person  shall  not  be  evicted  or
excluded from the shared household or any part of it
by  the  respondent  save  in  accordance  with  the
procedure established by law.
…………………………………………
19.  Residence  orders.- (1)  While  disposing  of  an
application under sub-section (1) of section 12, the
Magistrate  may,  on  being  satisfied  that  domestic8
violence has taken place, pass a residence order - (a)
restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in
any  other  manner  disturbing the  possession  of the
aggrieved person from the shared household, whether
or not the respondent has a legal or equitable interest
in the shared household;
 (b) directing the respondent to remove himself from
the shared household; 
(c) restraining the respondent or any of his relatives
from entering any portion of the shared household in
which the aggrieved person resides;
(d)  restraining  the  respondent  from  alienating  or
disposing off the shared household or encumbering
the same;
(e)  restraining  the  respondent  from  renouncing  his
rights in the shared household except with the leave of
the Magistrate; or 
(f) directing the respondent to secure same level of
alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as
enjoyed by her in the shared household or to pay rent
for the same, if the circumstances so require: 
Provided  that  no  order  under  clause  (b)  shall  be
passed against any person who is a woman.
……………………………………………………” 
15.A reading of the aforesaid provisions show that it creates an
entitlement in favour of the woman of the right of residence
under the “shared household” irrespective of her having any legal
interests in the same. The direction, inter alia, can include an
order restraining dispossession or a direction to remove himself9
on being satisfied that domestic violence had taken place.
16.The factual matrix of the present case is such that one
would have  to look to the  definition  clauses relevant  for  the
determination  of  the  controversy  contained  in  Section  2  as
under:
“2(f)  ""domestic  relationship""  means  a  relationship
between two persons who live or have, at any point of
time, lived together in a shared household, when they
are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a
relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are
family members living together as a joint family; 
………………………………………… .
2(s) ""shared household"" means a household where the
person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a
domestic relationship either singly or along with the
respondent and includes such a household whether
owned  or  tenanted  either  jointly  by  the  aggrieved
person and the respondent, or owned or tenanted by
either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved
person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have
any right, title, interest or equity and includes such a
household  which  may  belong  to  the  joint  family  of
which  the  respondent  is  a  member,  irrespective  of
whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has
any right, title or interest in the shared household.
……………………………………………………… ..”
17.The facts of the present case are that the respondent has
never stayed with the appellant in the premises in which she has
been directed to be inducted. This is an admitted position even in10
answer to a court query by the respondent during the course of
hearing. The “domestic relationship” as defined under Section 2
(f) of the D.V. Act refers to two persons who have lived together in
a “shared household”. A “shared household” has been defined
under Section 2(s) of the D.V. Act. In order for the respondent to
succeed, it was necessary that the two parties had lived in a
domestic  relationship  in  the  household.  However,  the  parties
have never lived together in the property in question. It is not as
if  the  respondent  has  been  subsequently  excluded  from  the
enjoyment of the property or thrown out by the appellant in an
alleged relationship which goes back 20 years.   They fell apart
even as per the respondent more than 7 years ago. We may also
note that till 22.2.2010 even the wife of the appellant was alive.
We may note for the purpose of record that as per the appellant,
he is a Christian and thus there could be no question of visiting
any temple and marrying the respondent by applying “kumkum”,
and that too when the wife of the appellant was alive. 
18.We are thus unequivocally of the view that the nature of the
ex-parte order passed on 19.9.2016 permitting the respondent to
occupy the premises of the appellant cannot be sustained and
has to be set aside and consequently Civil Appeal No.2500 of
2017 is liable to be allowed.11
19.Now turning to the second controversy, a perusal of the
impugned order shows that the learned Single Judge found the
remedy  sought  for  by  the  respondent  to  be  “misconceived”.
However, the learned Judge found it appropriate to treat the
petition as one under Section 407 of the Cr.P.C. The learned
Single Judge has expressed the view that the appellate court
ought to have called upon the respondent to argue the appeal
rather  than  spend  time  on  interim  reliefs,  which  was  not
maintainable  in  the  face  of  the  earlier  order  resulting  in  a
predictable order.
20.We fail to appreciate the aforesaid observations when the
respondent herself sought once again to press for interim relief
and applications to adduce additional evidence. Learned ASJ can
hardly be faulted on this account. The learned Single Judge has
also given latitude to the respondent on account of her appearing
in person whereby she may not have documented the bits and
pieces of her past with the intention of initiating the proceedings
which she was pursuing. In the conspectus of the same, the
appeal has been withdrawn to the High Court itself.
21.The grievance of the appellant against this order is that the
valuable  rights  of  the  appellant  of  an  additional  forum  to
ventilate his grievance would be lost as against any decision in12
appeal. A remedy of revision under Section 327 of the Cr.P.C.
would be available or a writ petition under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India. In this behalf reliance has been placed on
what is claimed to be a settled legal position, more particularly,
the Constitutional Bench Judgment of 7 Judges of this Court in
A.R.Antulay vs. Ram Naik  1.
22.It is also the contention of the appellant that such transfer
cannot take place at the whims and fancy of the respondent. The
respondent,  whenever  she  fails  to  obtain  a  favourable  order,
chooses to file proceedings for transfer whether it be before the
MM  or  before  the  appellate  court.  It  is  submitted  that  this
approach ought not to be encouraged.
23.On examination of the issue, we tend to agree with the
submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that
there was no reason for the proceedings to be withdrawn from
the appellate court to the High Court itself.  There is not only
absence of the reason for the same but it would also result in the
deprivation of valuable rights of the appellant against the order of
an appellate authority and thus an additional forum for scrutiny
was being negated.
24.We are unable to agree with the reasoning of the learned
Single Judge nor can we fault the appellate authority on any
1 (1988) 2 SCC 60213
account which could have necessitated such withdrawal of the
proceedings to the High Court.
25.We  may  also  note  the  concession  made  by  the  learned
senior counsel for the appellant in court that in the scenario the
matter can be entrusted to any ASJ in Bangalore as there are a
large number of the same holding court.
26.We thus set aside even the order dated 24.10.2016 and
allow Civil Appeal No.2502/2017. We request the learned Chief
Justice of the High Court on the administrative side to nominate
any  of  the  ASJs  in  Bangalore  to  hear  the  appeal  of  the
respondent  and  the  appellate  authority  shall  endeavor  to
conclude the proceedings as expeditiously as possible.
 27.The appeals are accordingly allowed leaving the parties to
bear their own costs with the hope that there would be an early
end to this contentious dispute between the two parties.

sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 15

before this Court in Shahejadkhan Mahebubkhan Pathan
Vs. State of Gujarat , reported in (2013) 1 SCC 570,
whereby having regard to the financial and other
social conditions of the convicted person, this Court
reduced the substantial sentence to 10 years and the
default  sentence  to  six  months.   The  relevant
considerations are available at paragraphs 15 and 16
of the Judgment, which read as follows :-
“15.It is clear that clause (b) of
sub-section 1 of Section 30 of the Code
authorises  the  court  to  award
imprisonment in default of fine up to
one-fourth of the term of imprisonment
which the court is competent to inflict
as punishment for the offence.  However,
considering  the  circumstances  placed
before  us  on  behalf  of  the
appellant-accused viz. they are very poor
and have to maintain their family, it was
their first offence and if they fail to
pay the amount of fine as per the order
of the Additional Sessions Judge, they
have to remain in jail for a period of 3
years  in  addition  to  the  period  of
substantive  sentene  because  of  their
inability to pay the fine, we are of the
view  that  serious  prejudice  will  be
caused not only to them but also to their
family members who are innocent.  We are,
therefore, of the view that ends of
justice would be met if we order that in3
default of payment of fine of Rs. 1.5
lakhs, the appellants shall undergo RI
for 6 months instead of 3 years as
ordered by the Additional Sessions Judge
and confirmed by the High Court.  
16.For  the  reasons  stated  above,
both the appeals are partly allowed.  The
conviction  recorded  is  confirmed  and
sentence imposed upon the appellants to
undergo RI for 15 years is modified to 10
years.  The order of payment of fine of
Rs. 1.5 lakhs each is also upheld but the
order that in default of payment of fine,
the appellants shall undergo RI for 3
years is reduced to RI for 6 months.
Since the appellants have already served
nearly 12 years in jail, we are of the
view that as per the modified period of
sentence in respect of default in payment
of fine, there is no need for them to
continue in prison.  The appellants shall
be set at liberty forthwith unless they
are required in any other offence.  It is
further made clear that for any reasons,
if the appellants have not completed the
modified period of sentence, they will be
released  after  the  period  indicated
hereinabove is over.”   
6.Having heard the learned senior counsel appearing
for the appellant and the learned counsel appearing
for the State, on facts, we do not find any reason to
take a different view.  Accordingly, the appeal is4
allowed.  The substantial sentence of the appellant
is reduced to 10 years and the sentence in default on
payment of fine is reduced to six months.

ASHOK BHUSHAN, J.
1.The Transfer Petition and the Special Leave2
Petition arising out of similar facts and events
have been heard together and are being decided by
this common order. The background facts giving
rise to the transfer petition as well as Special
Leave Petition need to be noted first.
2.The parties in both the cases being common
shall be hereinafter referred to as described in
the transfer petition. Janhit Manch and another
which had filed the PIL at the Bombay High Court
are referred to as petitioners whereas, Shri Ram
Urban Infrastructure Ltd.(SRUIL) is referred to
as respondent No.6 and other respondents are
referred to as described in transfer petition.  
3.The genesis of dispute is PIL No. 43 of 2012
filed by petitioners in the Bombay High Court.
In PIL No.43 of 2012, petitioners have questioned
the action of respondent No. 3 in respect of
concessions granted for development of various
buildings in the city of Mumbai i.e. c oncessions3
granted in respect of development of various
buildings   which   consequently   enabled   the
developers   to   amass   additional   areas   under
various heads, such as refuge areas, passages,
flower beds, decks etc.,  free of Floor Space
Index (“FSI”).  The case of the respondent No.6
was specifically mentioned and challenged. It was
pleaded   that   respondent   No.6   against   the
permitted FSI   of 54715.196 sq. mtrs.   had used
additional FSI of approximately  6355.58 sq. mtrs.
under the guise of various heads such as refuge
areas, passages, decks etc.  
4.The Bombay High Court  vide its judgment dated
13.05.2013 decided the PIL No.43 of 2012. In its
judgment, the High Court held that the refuge
areas granted to respondent No.6 with respect to
the said building was in utter excess of norms.
Thus,   Municipal   Commissioner   was   directed   to
re­examine the issue of excess refuge area and to4
re­issue   the   FSI.   Petitioners   filed   SLP(C)
No.20279 of 2013, challenging the judgment of the
High Court dated 13.05.2013.
5.The   respondent   No.6   had   proceeded   to
construct a 56 storey building. Respondent No.6
also   proposed   to   construct   a   public   parking
lot(PPL) of three Basements + Lower ground +
Stilt + 15 Floors. Stop Work Notice was issued by
Mumbai Municipal Corporation on 14.12.2011 to
respondent No.6 to desist from continuing with
construction of public parking lot. The said Stop
Work Notice was challenged by respondent No.6 in
Bombay City Civil Court by L.C. Suit No.2942 of
2011. After judgment of the High Court dated
13.05.2013, the respondent No.6 approached the
Municipal   Commissioner.   The   Municipal
Commissioner passed an order on 12.09.2013. The
Municipal Commissioner in his order observed that
(i) Refuge areas would be provided free of FSI5
only to the extent of 4 per cent  of the built up
area it served in the said building; (ii) those
areas in excess of requirements would be counted
in FSI in accordance with National Building Code,
2005. 
7.Respondent No.6, aggrieved by the order dated
12.09.2013, filed a Writ Petition (c) No.2223 of
2013 before the Bombay High Court. The order of
Civil Court dated 16.05.2013 whereby Stop Work
Notice was set aside, was also challenged by
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay in the
High Court by filing a First Appeal No.884 of
2015.
8.The petitioners' SLP(C) No.20279 of 2013 was
finally heard, in which separate and dissenting
judgments were delivered on 25.04.2014, which
mandated the SLP to be referred to a larger
Bench.   The   petitioner   had   filed   another   PIL
No.133 of 2015, where certain amendments in DCR6
were   challenged.   The   Writ   Petition   filed   by
respondent No.6 being Writ No.2223 of 2013 was
decided   on   22nd,  25th  and   27th  January   2016
alongwith First Appeal No.884 of 2015.
9.Municipal Commissioner was directed to hear
the respondent No.6 and to decide what should be
the reasonable refuge area in the said building.
The   order   dated   12.09.2013   was   confirmed   in
parts. The SLP(C) No.20279 of 2013 was listed on
11.03.2016 on which date, the Three Judge Bench
disposed off the SLP holding that in view of
judgment of the High Court dated 22nd, 25th and
27th, January 2016 no issue is alive, however, the
liberty was granted to make a mention for recall
of the order.
10.The judgment of Bombay High Court dated 22nd,
25th and 27th  January, 2016 was challenged by the
respondent   No.6   before   this   court   in   SLP(C)
No.10704­05 of 2016. This Court on 29.04.2016 has7
issued   a   notice   in   SLP   of   respondent   No.6,
however,   no   interim   order   was   passed.   The
petitioners   also   preferred   the   SLP(C)   CC
Nos.13527­13528 of 2016, challenging the above
judgment of the Bombay High Court. Petitioners
also filed IA 6 of 2016 for recalling the Three
Judge Bench order dated 11.03.2016, contending
that   several   issues   remain   alive   for
adjudication. After the order of Bombay High
Court dated 22nd, 25th  and 27th  January, 2016,
respondent No.3 passed an order on 31.08.2016.
Respondent No.3  inter alia held that:
“(a)The areas provided on the
external peripheral face of the
flat be allowed as refuge area;
(b)The   refuge   areas   at   the
inside   of   the   building   at
entrances of flats shall not be
considered as refuge area;
(c)The four full floors shown
as refuge will not be taken as
refuge; and
(d)The   structural   columns
falling  in   the   above   decided8
refuge areas can be allowed free
of FSI.”
11.The   order   dated   31.08.2016   passed   by
respondent No.3 was challenged by the petitioners
by filing PIL No.17 of 2017. High Court  vide its
order dated 24.02.2017 directed the respondent
No.2 to file its affidavit in reply within three
weeks and not to act upon the impugned order
dated   31.08.2016   till   the   next   date.
Subsequently, matter was taken by the Bombay High
Court for hearing on 17.03.2017. After hearing
the counsel for both the parties, an order was
passed by the Bombay High Court on 17.03.2017.
Para No.4 to 7 of the order are to the following
effect:
“(4)Apparently,   the   subject
matter of the present litigation
is an order dated 31.08.2016 at
“Exhibit C” (page 58) which is
the   order   of   the   Municipal
Commissioner of Greater Mumbai
in pursuance of the directions
of this Court dated 27.01.20169
in Writ Petition (c) No. 2223 of
2013.
(5)Challenging   the   orders   in
Writ   Petition   (c)   No.2223   of
2013, both the parties i.e. the
petitioners and respondent No. 6
have   filed   Special   Leave
Petitions.   The   petitioners
before   us   have   filed   Special
Leave Petition No.13527 of 2016,
and respondent No.6 has filed
Special Leave Petition Nos.10704
to 10705 of 2006. Admittedly no
interim orders are issued in the
above   SLPs   before   the   Apex
Court. Meanwhile, in pursuance
of   the   directions   in   Writ
Petition (c) No.2223 of 2013,
the Commissioner has passed an
order dated 31.08.2016 which is
the   subject­matter   of   the
present   Public   Interest
Litigation.   Since   the   larger
issues are pending before the
Apex   Court   pertaining   to   the
very same alleged illegalities
committed by respondent No.6 so
far as the property in question,
both the parties are in ad idem
with   the   submission   that   the
impugned   order   of   the
Commissioner   dated   31.08.2016
also can be challenged before
the Apex Court since that will
put an end to the controversy
between   the   parties   once   for
all.10
6.In that view of the matter,
the parties are at liberty to
approach   the   Apex   Court   with
necessary   application   for
transferring the present Public
Interest Litigation also to be
tagged   alongwith   the   Special
Leave Petitions pending before
the Apex Court.
7.In   order   to   enable   the
parties   to   take   appropriate
course   of   action   as   stated
above, we continue the interim
order   dated   24.02.2017   for   a
period of four weeks.”
12.In view of the order of the Bombay High Court
dated 17.03.2017, the Transfer Petition has been
filed by the petitioners in this Court. 
13.SLP(C)   Nos.11749­11750   of   2017   have   been
filed by respondent No.6, questioning the interim
order passed by the Bombay High Court dated
24.02.2017 and 17.03.2017 in PIL No.17 of 2017.
 
14.We have heard Shri Mukul Rohatgi, senior
counsel appearing for the petitioners and Shri
Kapil   Sibal,   senior   counsel   appearing   for11
respondent No.6. Shri Mukul Rohatgi contends that
the judgments of the Bombay High Court dated 22nd,
25th and 27th January 2016 have been challenged by
both petitioners as well as respondent No.6 by
filing different SLPs, which are pending for
consideration. Notice has also been issued by
this Court in SLP filed by respondent No.6 on
29.04.2016   and   on   18.07.2016,   SLP(C)
Nos.13527­13528 of 2016 filed by the petitioners
have been ordered to be tagged with the SLP(C)
Nos.10704­10705 of 2016. The subsequent order
passed by Municipal Commissioner dated 31.08.2016
has been passed, in consequence of the judgment
of the Bombay High Court dated 22nd, 25th and 27th
January 2016. The order passed by the High Court
being   already   under   challenge,   by   both   the
parties in this Court, subsequent order dated
31.08.2016   has   also   been   challenged   by
petitioners by filing PIL No.17 of 2017 wherein,
learned counsel for both the parties before the12
Bombay High Court have stated that the issues,
which are raised in PIL No.17 of 2017 are the
issues, which are already engaging attention of
this Court in above mentioned two SLPs filed by
both the parties. The High Court, thus, after
further hearing the parties granted liberty to
the writ petitioner to file an application for
transfer   of   PIL   No.17   of   2017   to   be   heard
alongwith pending SLP. It is submitted that all
the issues raised are issues of vital public
importance, concerning with safety and security
of persons who will occupy the concerned building
and it is necessary that issues are finally
decided by this Court so that correct and valid
measures   are   taken   by   respondent   No.2   to
respondent No.5 regarding construction and use of
the building which will house hundreds of people.
15.Shri Kapil Sibal, Sr. Advocate,  vehemently,
opposing   the   transfer   petition   contends   that13
there is no ground to transfer the PIL No.17 of
2017 in this Court. Municipal Commissioner by an
order dated 31.08.2016 has decided all the issues
which have been questioned by the petitioners in
the High Court where all the issues can be gone
into and decided? In view of the subsequent order
of the Commissioner dated 31.08.2016, earlier
litigation   including   SLPs   filed   by   both   the
parties against the judgment of the High Court
dated 22nd, 25th and 27th January, 2016 ought not to
be required to be adjudicated on merits and it is
futile to transfer the PIL to this Court. It is
further   contended   that   in   none   of   the   Writ
Petitions filed by the petitioners or the SLPs
any interim order has been passed either by the
Bombay High Court or by this Court and it is for
the first time that on 24.02.2017 interim order
has been passed by the High Court in PIL No.17 of
2017.It is contended that the building is
standing for last five years to be occupied by14
the occupants who are waiting for occupying the
flats.   Petitioners   are   under   heavy   recurring
liability by paying interest per month to the
extend of crores of rupees, which is causing
great hardship and prejudice to respondent No.6.
It is submitted that construction of the building
has been as per sanction plan and it is not the
case of anyone that there is any violation of
sanction plan. It is contended that the refuge
area is now earmarked adjoining each flats by
respondent No.6, which has been rightly accepted
by Municipal Commissioner and the four floors
which were separately earmarked as refuge area
has not been upheld. It is submitted that the PIL
initiated by the petitioners is not bona­fide
litigation and in fact it has been set up by
rival builders with whom respondent No.6 has
dispute.   It   is   also   submitted   that   transfer
petition deserved to be rejected and the SLP(C)
Nos.11749­11750 of 2017 be allowed, setting aside15
the interim order passed by the High Court dated
24.02.2017 as extended on 17.03.2017 in PIL No.17
of 2017.
16.We have considered the submissions of both
the parties and perused the record. The order
passed   by   the   Municipal   Commissioner   dated
12.09.2013, in pursuance of order passed by the
Bombay High Court on 13.05.2013 in PIL No.43 of
2012 was challenged by respondent No.6 in Writ
Petition(C) No.2223 of 2013 before the Bombay
High Court. The order of the High Court dated
13.05.2013   passed   in   PIL   No.43   of   2013   was
already challenged by the Petitioners by SLP(C)
No.20279 of 2013. The Writ Petition(C) No.2223 of
2013 filed by respondent No.6 was decided by the
Bombay   High   Court   on   27.01.2016,   which   was
challenged by both petitioners and respondent
No.6 by means of SLPs, as noted above. After the
order dated 27.01.2016, Municipal Commissioner16
proceeded to pass an order dated 31.08.2016. The
Municipal   Commissioner   after   re­examining   the
issue regarding refuge area held, as follows:
“1.Periphery   refuge   area
surrounding   each   flat   on   each
floor(4 flats in number on each
floor) was allowed.
[Note:   The   total   refuge   area
allowed   by   the   Commissioner
surrounding   the   flats   on   each
floor   amounts   to   60%   of   the
habitable area on the respective
floor]
2.4 entire refuge floors were to
be blocked.
3.National Building Code 2005
would   not   apply   since   the
building is already constructed
as   per   past   approved   plans
(contrary to the Judgment dated
27.01.2016).”
17.The   order   dated   31.08.2016   has   been
challenged by petitioners by filing PIL No.17 of
2017 in which Bombay High Court passed an order
on 24.02.2017 and 17.03.2017, as noted above. The
order of Commissioner dated 31.08.2016 has been17
passed   in   pursuance   and   consequence   of   the
judgment of the High Court dated 27.01.2016.
Judgment dated 27.01.2016 is now challenged in
this Court by SLP filed by both the parties. In
SLP filed by respondent No.6 notice has been
issued by this Court and the SLP filed by the
Petitioners has been  tagged with other SLP.
18.The important issues, pertaining to refuge
area, FSI are engaging the attention of this
Court.   Provisions   of   the   Development   Control
Regulations for   Greater Mumbai, 1991   are under
consideration. The developments carried out by
builders in buildings, which is to house hundreds
of   people   are   not   question   of   rights   of
developers alone. The development regulations and
various other statutory rules enjoin performance
of   various   statutory   duties   and   statutory
obligations   in   respect   to   development   of
buildings,   which   are   to   house   hundreds   of18
occupants. The life and safety of occupants is a
matter of public importance and the issues raised
relate to public concern & safety which need to
be decided at the earliest.
19.The concern expressed by Shri Kapil Sibal
that   due   to   delay   caused   in   finalizing   the
issues, respondent No.6 has been suffering huge
loss, is also a matter of concern. Early decision
of such disputes is in the interest of both the
public in general as well as the persons who have
carried   out   development   after   incurring   huge
expenditure.
20.It is relevant to note that the Bombay High
Court   in   Paras   4   to   7   of   the   Order   dated
17.03.2017, noticing the facts that issues raised
in   PIL   No.17   of   2017   are   already   pending
consideration in this Court as mentioned in Para
5 has granted liberty to the petitioners to move
an application to file a transfer petition. 19
21.After having considered the submissions of
the parties and perusing the material brought
before us, we are of the opinion that issues
which   have   been   raised   in   the   SLP(C)   CC
Nos.13527­13528 of 2016 filed by the petitioners
and   SLP(C)   Nos.10704­10705   of   2016   filed   by
respondent No.6 have bearing on the PIL No.17 of
2017 and it is in the interest of all the parties
that such issues be decided finally, when the
issues have already been entertained by this
Court, as noted above.
22.Learned counsel for both the parties although
have raised various submissions touching on the
merits of issue but at this stage when we are
considering only the petition for transfer of PIL
No.17 of 2017 as well as the challenge to only
interim orders passed by Bombay High Court in PIL
No.17 of 2017, we refrain to express any opinion
on various aspects relating merits of the case.20
The observations made by us in this order are
limited for deciding the transfer petition and
SLPs before us, such observations may not have
any bearing on the issues when they are finally
heard and decided.
23.It is further relevant to notice that the
SLP(C) No.20279 of 2013, which was filed by
petitioner against the order dated 13.05.2013 of
the Bombay High Court in PIL No.43 of 2012, which
was   disposed   of   by   Three   Judge   Bench   on
13.05.2013, an application on I.A.6 has also been
filed by the petitioners to recall the order and
determine the issues. No order has yet been
passed in I.A.6 of 2016, which application   is
waiting for consideration  by Three Judge Bench.
24.In   view   of   forgoing   discussion,   SLP(C)
Nos.10704­10705 of 2016 filed against order dated
27.01.2016 being pending consideration, ends of
justice   be   served   in   allowing   the   transfer21
petition transferring the PIL No.17 of 2017 from
Bombay High Court to this Court to be heard
alongwith   SLP(C)   Nos.10704­10705   of   2016   and
SLP(C) CC Nos. 13527­13528 of 2016. The transfer
petition is thus allowed.
25.Coming to SLP(C) Nos.11749­11750 of 2017, in
which   interim   order   dated   24.02.2017   and
17.03.2017 have been passed by the Bombay High
Court, in view of the order passed in Transfer
Petition(C) No.567 of 2017, the PIL No.17 of 2017
is being transferred to this Court. As on the

the aforesaid interim orders, however, PIL No.17
of 2017 having been transferred to be heard by
this Court, it is open for the parties to pray

R.F. Nariman, J.
1)The present reference arises from a judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court reported as  Bhuwalka Steel
Industries Limited and Another  vs.  Union of India and
Others, (2017) 5 SCC 598.  The question before the Court was
set out as follows:-
“20.  The validity of Rule 5 of the 1997 Rules is
challenged both before the High Court and before
us on two grounds: 
1. That the Rule is ultra vires the authority
conferred under Section 3-A of the Act; and 
2. That the Rule is violative of Article 14 of
the  Constitution  of  India.  Because  the  Rule
creates two classes of manufacturers:-
(i) whose ACP is determined to be more than their
actual production  in the Financial Year 1996-97.
(ii) Whose ACP is determined to be less than
their  actual production  for the Financial year
1996-97; and 
imposes an irrational tax burden on the second of
the above-mentioned two classes of manufacturers
falling within the ambit of the 1997 Rules.”
2)This  question  has  not  been  answered  by  the
Division Bench.  Instead, the Division Bench went into a
completely different  question,  which  was  posed  as
follows:-
“51. Whether an assessee who chooses once to pay
duty in terms of Rule 96-ZP(3) can be compelled
to pay duty calculated in accordance with the
said Rule for all times to come without any
regard to the  actual production  is a question
which requires examination.”3
3)This question was then referred to a larger Bench  as
follows:-
“63. Therefore, we find it difficult to accept
the submission of the respondent that the issue
is covered by the judgments of this Court in
Venus Castings  (2000) 4 SCC 206 and  Supreme
Steels (2001) 9 SCC 645. In our opinion, for the
reasons  mentioned  above,  these  two  judgments
require a further examination. Apart from that,
these judgments did not deal with vires of Rule
96-ZP(3).  However, in view of the fact that
Supreme Steels  is a decision rendered by a Bench
of three learned Judges, we deem it appropriate
that the question of law be settled by a Bench of
an appropriate strength. We, therefore, direct
the Registry to place the matter before Hon'ble
the Chief Justice of India for further orders.”
4)Mrs.  Nalini  Chidambaram,  learned  Senior  Advocate
appearing on behalf of the appellant-assessee, states that
she came to Court challenging the vires of Rule 5 instead
of which a completely different question has been referred
to a larger Bench.  She further submits that she is not, in
any way, challenging the fact that an assessee can be
compelled to pay duty in terms of Rule 96-ZP(3) without
regard to actual production which is laid down Section
3A(4) of the Central Excise Act.
5)This being the case, we answer this reference by
stating that the question posed before us did not arise at
all on facts and the question which has been referred is
not something which the assessee disputes.  Accordingly,
the matter is sent back to a Division Bench to decide the
questions stated in para 20 of Bhuwalka Steel Industries
Limited and Another (supra) .  The issues other than the4
issue raised in para 51 of the judgment in Bhuwalka Steel
Industries Limited and Another (supra)  may also be decided
in the other tagged matters by the Division Bench.
6)The appeals and the tagged matters be placed before a
Division Bench of this Court.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6753 OF 2019
(Arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 19807/2019)
Rohan Virani & Ors.    …Appellants
versus
State of Maharashtra & Ors.      …Respondents
J U D G M E N T
INDU MALHOTRA, J.
Leave granted. 
1.The   present   Civil   Appeal   has   been   filed   by   a   batch   of
students   from   University   of   Mumbai   to   challenge   the
Judgement and Order dated 25.07.2019 passed by a division
1bench of the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition (ST) No.
20304 of 2019.
     The issue which arises is with respect to admission to the
Post Graduate courses of MBA/MMS in the Jamnalal Bajaj
Institute of Management Studies (“ JBIMS”) for the current
academic year 2019­2020. The contest is based on the issue
whether JBIMS is to be treated as an autonomous or non­
autonomous Department of the University of Mumbai for the
current academic year.
2.JBIMS   was   established   in   1965   as   a   Department   of   the
University of Mumbai, and is one of the most prestigious and
oldest institutions for management courses in the country.
      It   has   consistently   been   ranked   amongst   the   top   10
business   schools   in   India.   JBIMS   is   well   known   for   its
distinguished and professional faculty members, including
representatives from industry and academia.
2.1.The University of Mumbai  vide letter dated 11.07.2014,
granted autonomous status to JBIMS for a period of
five years from the academic year 2014­2015 to 2018­
2019.
   A perusal of the letter dated 11.07.2014, shows that
the   Academic   Council   vide  Resolution   dated
07.06.2014,   and   the   Management   Council   of   the
University   of   Mumbai   vide  Resolution   dated
207.06.2014, resolved to confer autonomous status on
JBIMS.
   The autonomous status was granted for a period of 5
years from the academic year 2014­15 to 2018­19.
2.2.For the academic years 2014­2015, 2015­2016, 2016­
2017,   and   2017­2018,   admissions   to   the   MBA   and
MMS   Courses   in   JBIMS   was   conducted   as   an
Autonomous   PG   Department   of   the   University   of
Mumbai. 
      The autonomy granted to JBIMS from 2014­2015 to
2018­2019 was not challenged by any party.
      As a consequence, 85% seats were filled up from all
universities in the State of Maharashtra on the basis of
merit, while 15% were filled up from the all India quota
merit list.
2.3.As   per   Section   122   (4)   of   the   Maharashtra   Public
Universities   Act,   2016,   Autonomous
Colleges/University Departments may prescribe their
own   courses   of   study,   evolve   their   own   teaching
methods and conduct examinations and tests for their
students, and recommend the award of degrees, and
diplomas   to   the   University   as   per   the   procedure
prescribed in the Statutes.
2.4.During the academic year 2018­2019, the Directorate
of Technical Education issued a Notification whereby
3100% seats in JBIMS were allocated to the students
from the State of Maharashtra, and thereby wiped out
the 15% all India quota in entirety. The Bombay High
Court in  Mayuri  Umesh  Munde   v.  Directorate   of   the
Technical Education & Ors.   [W.P. (L) No. 2342 /2018
decided on 27.07.2018] held the 100% State quota to
be illegal and impermissible.
2.5.The JBIMS vide letter dated 18.02.2019 addressed to
the Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra,
informed   the   Directorate   that   JBIMS   was   an
autonomous department of the University of Mumbai.
A decision was taken by the Board of Management on
15.02.2019,   that   JBIMS   would   process   its   own
admission program for the MMS course for the ensuing
academic   year   2019­2020.   The   Directorate   was
requested not to include JBIMS in the CET process,
and further informed that the procedure for admission
and the timelines being followed would be intimated in
due course.
      A separate letter dated 18.02.2019 was addressed to
the Admission Regulatory Authority (CET­Cell) to the
same effect.
2.6.The JBIMS addressed a letter dated 25.05.2019 to the
Vice   Chancellor   of   the   University   of   Mumbai,   for
extension of its autonomous status.
4        Further letters dated 27.06.2019 and 28.06.2019
were written to the Vice Chancellor for extension of
autonomy for the next five­year period.
2.7.For   the   academic   year   2019­2020,   a   confusion
occurred   about   the   status   of   JBIMS   since   the
autonomous   status   granted   by   the   University   of
Mumbai was for a period of five years i.e. from 2014 to
2019.
2.8.The Combined Entrance Test, was conducted by the
CET­Cell, Maharashtra, for the current academic year
on   09/10.03.2019.   The   results   were   declared   on
30.03.2019.
2.9.The State of Maharashtra  vide G.R. dated 04.06.2019
followed   by   the   Information   Brochure   dated
29.06.2019, set out the seat matrix for autonomous
institutes,   and   non­autonomous   institutes   and
University Departments as follows :­
Autonomous        :85% State Level
Non­Autonomous &         : 
University Department70% for Home University 
15% for Other Universities
2.10.On 01.07.2019, the Directorate of Technical Education
published   information   on   its   website   showing   the
status   of   JBIMS   as   non­autonomous.     As   a
consequence, out of a total of 120 seats in JBIMS, 79
were   to   be   allocated   to   the   Home   University   i.e.
5University of Mumbai in all categories; 17 seats were to
be allocated to Outside Home Universities (OHU); and
5 seats were to be allocated to Persons with Disabilities
(PWD). The balance 18 seats constituted 15% of the
total number of seats left as the All India Quota.
2.11.JBIMS  vide  letter   dated   09.07.2019,   informed   the
Director   of   Technical   Education,   Maharashtra   that
JBIMS is a department of the University of Mumbai.
The University itself is an autonomous body, and can
grant   autonomy   to   its   own   departments.   The
Application for extension of autonomy had been made
before the Vice Chancellor. The Vice Chancellor of the
University had permitted JBIMS to apply and get the
process   of   extension   of   autonomy   started.   The
extension of autonomy was expected to be received in
due course.
2.12.On 17.07.2019 the CET­Cell, Maharashtra published
the Allotment List for students, including JBIMS. In
CAP Round 1, admissions were done on the basis of
JBIMS being a Non­Autonomous Institute.
2.13.The Appellants herein are students from the University
of Mumbai, who secured admission in JBIMS on the
basis of the Seat Allocation made in CAP Round 1.
2.14.On 18.07.2019, Writ Petition bearing No. 20304/2019
was filed by Respondent Nos. 7 to 15 herein, who are
6students   from   Other   Universities   in   the   State   of
Maharashtra,   to   challenge   the   admissions   made   to
JBIMS by treating it as a Non­Autonomous Institute. 
     The Writ Petitioners   inter alia  contended that they
had secured higher ranks on merit in the Common
Entrance   Test.     However,   the   admissions   were
conducted   on   the   basis   of   JBIMS   being   a   Non­
Autonomous Institute, and the Writ Petitioners were
not able to secure admission, since 70% of the seats in
JBIMS   were   allocated   to   students   from   the   Home
University i.e. the University of Mumbai. Had JBIMS
been   treated   as   an   Autonomous   Institute   for   the
current academic year, then  85% seats would  have
been   filled   up   by   candidates   from   all   universities
across the State on the basis of merit in the Common
Entrance Test.
   The Writ Petitioners  inter alia prayed for a direction
to the respondents to initiate and complete the process
of extension of the autonomous status of JBIMS by
following the procedure prescribed under Statutes No.
593 to 642 framed by the University of Mumbai; quash
the Allotment List dated 17.07.2019; grant an interim
injunction to restrain the CET­Cell, Maharashtra from
carrying on with the admission process.
72.15.Given the urgency of the matter, a division bench of
the Bombay High Court took up the matter for final
hearing   and   passed   the   impugned   judgment   on
25.07.2019.
      It   may   be   noted   that   the   University   Grants
Commission   (“UGC”)   was   not   served,   and   was   not
represented before the High Court.
      The   Appellants   herein   have   raised   a   serious
grievance that even though their names were contained
in   the   Allotment   List   dated   17.07.2019,   they   were
neither impleaded in the Writ Petition, nor was notice
issued to them by the High Court.
2.16.The High Court   vide  Impugned Judgment and Order
dated   25.07.2019,   allowed   the   Writ   Petition,   and
directed that the admissions process be re­conducted
by treating JBIMS as an Autonomous Institute.
   The High Court recorded in para 42 of the impugned
judgment that the Advocate General for Maharashtra
did not dispute that the University of Mumbai had the
power to confer autonomous status on JBIMS. As per
Section   122   of   the   Maharashtra   Public   Universities
Act,   2016,   a   University   Department   or   Institution,
affiliated college, or recognized institution could apply
to   the   University   for   grant   of   autonomous   status.
8Autonomy was not granted by the State Government,
but by the University.
      The High Court further held that JBIMS continued to
be an Autonomous Institute, since its Application for
extension of autonomy was pending approval before
the University. The Vice Chancellor of the University
had permitted JBIMS to apply for extension, and get
the process commenced.  As a consequence, the status
of autonomy of JBIMS was neither surrendered, nor
was it revoked.
        In this backdrop, the State Government and the
Directorate   of   Technical   Education   could   not   have
proceeded on the premise that the autonomous status
of   JBIMS   had   automatically   come   to   an   end   on
11.07.2019. The presumption of the State that JBIMS
is   a   Non­Autonomous   Institute   was   held   to   be
unsustainable.
   The High Court further held that the status of JBIMS
remained unaltered, and that JBIMS had not lost its
autonomy.   In   these   circumstances,   the   modification
brought   about   by   the   Directorate   of   Technical
Education by showing the status of JBIMS as non­
autonomous was set aside.
   It was directed that the entire admissions process be
re­conducted   by   treating   JBIMS   as   an   Autonomous
Institute. 
93.The Appellants herein are 39 students who filed the Special
Leave   Petition   against   the   aforesaid   Judgment   dated
25.07.2019 seeking special leave to appeal, since they were
not impleaded before the High Court. These Appellants come
from the University of Mumbai, and are seeking admission on
the basis of JBIMS being a non­autonomous Institute. 
      On   14.08.2019,   this   Court   issued   Notice   to   all   the
Respondents, and directed that  status quo be maintained in
the meanwhile. The matter was posted for final hearing on
28.08.2019.
4.The matter was taken up for final hearing on 28.08.2019.
The Appellant­Students were represented by Mr. C.U. Singh,
Sr. Adv., the State of Maharashtra was represented by Mr.
Prasenjit Keswani, Adv., the Respondent­Students [original
Writ Petitioners] were represented by Mr. S.B. Talekar, Adv.,
the University of Mumbai and JBIMS were represented by
Mr. Sunil Fernandes, Adv., and the UGC was represented by
Mr. Apoorv Kurup, Adv.
     The Court appointed Mr. Maninder Singh, Sr. Adv. to
appear as amicus curiae  and assist the Court.
5.We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   all   the   parties,
perused the material on record, and the written submissions
filed by all the parties, including the learned  amicus curiae . 
106.It   was   submitted   inter   alia  on   behalf   of   the   Appellant­
Students that :­
6.1.The   impugned   judgment   has   been   passed   after   the
Appellants had obtained admission. The Allotment List
was published on 17.07.2019 i.e. prior to the filing of
the Writ Petition. Hence, there was no justification for
not impleading them in the Writ Petition, even though
they were most vitally affected by the outcome of the
proceedings. The impugned judgment being   ex parte
qua  them, was liable to be set aside on this ground
alone.
6.2.The impugned judgment was passed without issuing
Notice to the UGC, even though it was joined as a party
respondent in the Writ Petition. Representation by the
UGC was necessary to determine the issues raised in
the Writ Petition, since it is the case of the Appellants
that concurrence of the UGC was mandatory for grant
of autonomous status. 
   The High Court decided the case with undue haste,
without granting a hearing to the necessary parties i.e.
the   Appellant­Students   who   had   already   secured
admission, and the UGC.
116.3.The   autonomous   status   conferred   by   the   University
was invalid, since the procedure prescribed by law had
not   been   fulfilled.   The   University   Statutes   apply   to
colleges as  well as university departments.  Statutes
No. 593 to 642 passed by the Senate of the University
of Mumbai in its Special Meeting held on 04.12.2001
pertain   to   grant   of   autonomous   status   to   Affiliated
College/University Department/University Institution.
6.4.The Appellants submitted that the Statutes No. 593 to
642   of   the   University   of   Mumbai   for   grant   of
autonomous   status   to   Affiliated   College/Recognized
Institution/University   Department/University
Institution,   passed   by   the   Senate   on   04.12.2001,
would be applicable to JBIMS as well.
      As   per   Statute   No.   595,   the   College/Recognized
Institution/University   Department/University
Institution desirous of having autonomous status shall
apply to the Registrar of the University.
     The Board of College and University Department
should   constitute   a   Committee   to   scrutinize   the
Applications   received.   The   Report   of   the   Scrutiny
Committee   shall   be   placed   before   the   Board   for   its
consideration.   After   careful   consideration   of   the
Report, the Board shall recommend the case of such
College/Recognized   Institution/University
12Department/University   Institution   to   the   Academic
Council for its consideration.
   As per Statute No. 597, the Academic Council, after
considering   the   recommendations   of   the   Board   of
College and University Department shall constitute the
Local Inquiry Committee, which would comprise of a
five­member committee, including one nominee of the
UGC.
    The Report of the Local Inquiry Committee shall be
placed   before   the   Academic   Council   for   its
consideration.   After   careful   consideration   of   the
Report,   the   Academic   Council   shall   recommend   the
same to the Management Council.
    The Management Council shall consider the Report
of   the   Local   Inquiry   Committee,   and   the
recommendations   of   the   Academic   Council,   and
thereafter take its decision whether autonomous status
be   conferred   on   the   applicant   College/Recognized
Institution/University   Department/University
Institution, or whether the Application be rejected.
    The Statutes of the University of Mumbai require a
recommendation   from   the   State   Government;   the
concurrence   from   the   UGC;   and   publication   of   a
Notification by the University of Mumbai notifying the
conferment of autonomous status.
13          However,   none   of   these   requirements   had   been
fulfilled in the present case. This would be apparent
from   the   fact   that   JBIMS   was   not   included   in   the
Annual List of Autonomous Colleges published by the
UGC.
6.5.JBIMS   was   granted   autonomy   for   a   period   of   five
academic   years   from   2014­15   to   2018­19   by   the
University.   Hence,   even   if   it   is   assumed   that   the
autonomous status of JBIMS was validly granted in
2014, it was certainly not applicable for the academic
year 2019­20.
6.6.It was further submitted that there is no provision for a
deemed   extension   of   the   autonomous   status   of   an
institute. Regulation 7.10 of the 2018 UGC Regulations
will   apply   only   if   an   Application   in   the   prescribed
format under Regulation 7.8, has been made to the
UGC,   at   least   6   months   prior   to   the   expiry   of   the
autonomy cycle.
6.7.The   Maharashtra   Unaided   Private   Professional
Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admissions to
Full   Time   Professional   Undergraduate   Technical
Courses) Rules, 2017 were made specifically applicable
to,   and   adopted   for   Government   aided/non­aided
institutions   and   University   Departments   vide  G.R.
dated 25.04.2017.
14      The   G.R.   dated   25.04.2017   prescribed   the   seat
matrix   for   admissions,   which   was   further   amended
vide the G.R. dated 04.06.2019.
6.8.It was submitted that even if there was some ambiguity
with   regard   to   the   definitions   of   “Autonomous
Institutes”   and   “Non­Autonomous   Institutes”   for   the
applicability   of   this   statutory   regime   to   JBIMS,   the
Information Brochure dated 29.06.2019 put all doubts
to rest, and conclusively answered this issue.
      The   Information   Brochure   dated   29.06.2019   is
admittedly the document on the basis of which both
the Writ Petitioners (Respondent Nos. 7 to 15 herein)
and the present Appellants have applied for admission.
   The said Information Brochure sets out the manner
in which the Admissions Act, 2015 and the Rules of
2017 are to be applied. It sets out the definition of an
“Autonomous Institution” as an institution to which
autonomy is granted by the UGC.
     The Writ Petitioners have neither challenged the
Information Brochure, nor the G.R. dated 25.04.2017.
6.9.It was further submitted that even if it is conceded that
JBIMS can be treated as a University Department, for
which the concurrence of the UGC is not required,
even   then  the  seat  matrix  applicable to   JBIMS  will
remain the same, since the seat matrix applicable to a
15non­autonomous   institution   and   a   university
department is the same.
7.The stand taken by the State of Maharashtra was similar to
that of the Appellants.
7.1.It was submitted that the concurrence of the UGC is
mandatory   for   grant   of   autonomous   status   to   an
educational institution.
7.2.It   was   further   submitted   that   the   Directorate   of
Technical Education  vide letter dated 19.01.2019 had
informed JBIMS that it is not included in the list of
autonomous colleges published by the UGC.
     JBIMS was asked to furnish proof of having been
granted autonomy after the concurrence of the UGC,
but JBIMS failed to do so.
7.3.It was further submitted that if the admissions process
is re­conducted by treating JBIMS as an autonomous
institute, then it will lead to complications in the entire
admissions process throughout the State.
8.The Respondent – Students, JBIMS, and the University of
Mumbai took the same stand that admissions to the current
academic year 2019­2020 ought to be carried out on the
basis   that   JBIMS   is   an   Autonomous   Department   of   the
University of Mumbai.
168.1.It   was   submitted   that   JBIMS   is   admittedly   a
Department  of the  University  of Mumbai. Since  the
University of Mumbai itself is autonomous, it does not
require   the   concurrence   of   the   UGC   for   granting
autonomous status to one of its own Departments. 
8.2.The   source   of   its   autonomy   was   on   the   basis   of
conferment by the University of Mumbai, which was
granted vide letter dated 11.07.2014 bearing Reference
No. APD/523/169/2014. The autonomy was granted
pursuant to the Resolution dated 07.06.2014 passed
by the Academic Council, and the Resolution dated
07.07.2014 passed by the Management Council. The
decision   of   the   University   of   Mumbai   to   confer
autonomous status to JBIMS was not challenged by
any party.
8.3.It  was  further  submitted  that   the   UGC  Regulations
published   on   12.02.2018   are   applicable   only   to
Colleges   and   Affiliated   Institutes,   and   have   no
application to University Departments, such as JBIMS.
8.4.It was further submitted that 3 other Departments of
the University of Mumbai  viz. Physics, Chemistry, and
Economics   were   granted   autonomous   status   by   the
University   almost   a   decade   ago.   Their   autonomous
status   is   continuing   till   date,   and   has   never   been
17questioned   either   by   the   State   Government,   or   the
UGC.
8.5.It was further submitted that the List of Autonomous
Colleges published by the UGC annually, includes only
Colleges, and not University Departments. The non­
inclusion   of   JBIMS   from   the   said   list   has   no
significance.
8.6.The   autonomous   status   of   JBIMS   granted   on
11.07.2014 till 2019, has neither been surrendered,
nor revoked. 
     Pursuant to the permission granted by the Vice
Chancellor to apply, and get the process of autonomy
started,   JBIMS   has   submitted   its   Application.   The
Application   is   under   active   consideration   of   the
University. 
9.The UGC was represented by counsel before this Court, and
filed detailed written submissions before the Court. It was
submitted that :­
9.1.The   UGC   had   initially   made   “Guidelines   for
Autonomous   Colleges   during   the   XIIth  Plan   Period
(2012 – 2017)” which in para 3 had made it clear that
only “Colleges” were eligible to apply for autonomous
status.
189.2.These guidelines were replaced by the “UGC Guidelines
for   Autonomous   Colleges,   2017”   which   also   were
applicable   only  to   “Colleges”.   Clause   6   of   the   2017
Guidelines provides the condition of eligibility, wherein
it is stated that: 
“All Colleges (of any discipline) under Section 2(f) of
the   UGC   Act   whether   aided,   partially   aided   and
unaided/self­financing   are   eligible   to   apply   for
autonomous status.”
9.3.The UGC promulgated the 2018 Regulations which in
Regulation 1.2, state that:
“These   Regulations   shall   apply   to   all
Colleges/Institutions which are affiliated to, or are
constituent   colleges   of   Universities   in   the   country
seeking   the   conferment   of   Autonomous   College
Status.”
   Regulation 6 states as follows :
“Colleges (of any discipline) whether aided, partially
aided   and   unaided/self­financing   are   eligible
provided they are under Section 2(f) of the UGC Act.”
Upon   grant   of   Autonomous   College   Status,   the
concerned   institution   would   be   entitled   to   the
benefits stipulated in Regulation 3.
   The term “College” which is defined in Regulation
2.4, cannot be interpreted to include a “Department”
of the Parent University, since a “Parent University”
is defined under Regulation 2.9 as follows :
19“The University to which the college concerned is
affiliated, or of  which the college concerned  is  a
constituent.”
   A Department of the University is neither affiliated to,
nor   a   constituent   of   that   University,   and   it   is   not
required to apply to the UGC for autonomous status in
terms of the University’s Statutes, since Universities
are   by   their   very   nature,   autonomous/independent
institutions of higher education.
9.4.The 2018 Regulations are applicable only to Colleges to
apply for autonomous status.
9.5.The   UGC   expressly   took   the   view   that   JBIMS   is
admittedly   neither   an   affiliated   college,   nor   a
constituent college, but a Department of the University
of Mumbai. A Department of the University of Mumbai
is not required to apply for autonomous status under
the UGC Regulations.
   It was further submitted that JBIMS is a Department
of the University of Mumbai, and is not required to
apply   for   autonomous   status   under   the   UGC
Regulations.   For   grant   of   autonomous   status   to   a
Department   of   the   University,   Section   122   of   the
Maharashtra   Public   Universities   Act,   2016   provides
that   the   University   Department   may   apply   to   the
University   for   grant   of   autonomous   status.   The
20Management   Council   on   the   recommendation   of   the
Academic Council may confer the autonomous status.
   The Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 itself
makes   a   distinction   between   a   “College”   and   a
“Department”. 
10.Mr. Maninder Singh, Sr. Adv., the learned  amicus curiae  inter
alia submitted that :­
10.1.The   autonomy   envisaged   under   Section   2(5)   of   the
Maharashtra   Public   Universities   Act,   2016   is
completely   different   from   the   autonomy   envisaged
under the Regulations framed by the UGC.
    The UGC (Conferment of Autonomous Status upon
Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards
in   Autonomous   Colleges)   Regulations,   2018   (“2018
UGC Regulations”) are applicable only to colleges, and
not to Departments of the University. This would be
evident   from   the   various   clauses   in   the   2018   UGC
Regulations. The Preamble to the Regulations states
that the Regulations have been promulgating college
autonomy. Clause 1.2. of the Regulations states that
the Regulations shall apply to all Colleges/ Institutions
which are affiliated to, or are constituent colleges of
Universities   in   the   country   seeking   conferment   of
Autonomous College status.
21     The definition of “College” under Clause 2.4 of the
2018 UGC Regulations, when read with the definition
of   “Parent   University”   under   Clause   2.9,   makes   it
abundantly clear that the 2018 UGC Regulations apply
only to affiliated or constituent colleges, and not to
University Departments.
     The phrase “autonomous college” is employed in
other provisions of the 2018 UGC Regulations, such as
in Clauses 2.1, 2.3, 2.6 and 2.7. The privileges granted
to an autonomous college are covered by Clause 3 of
the Regulations. Throughout the Regulations, reference
is   made   to   an   “autonomous   college”,   and   not   to   a
University Department.
   Clause 6 of the 2018 UGC Regulations contains the
eligibility clause, which refers only to colleges, whether
aided,   partially   aided,   or   un­aided/self­financing,
provided they fall under Section 2 (f) of the UGC Act.
   It was therefore, submitted that since JBIMS was not
a   College,   nor   an   Institution   affiliated   to,   nor   a
constituent   of   the   University,   the   2018   UGC
Regulations were not applicable to it.
      The   2018   UGC   Regulations   cannot   be   made
applicable   to   University   Departments,   since   the
University   itself   is   independent/autonomous   in   its
functioning,   and   therefore   there   is   nothing   that
22prohibits a University from granting autonomy to one
of its own Departments.
10.2.It   was   further   submitted   that   the   G.R.   dated
04.06.2019,   when   it   uses   the   word   “Autonomous”
would mean the status of autonomy granted by the
University   of   Mumbai   under   the   1994   Act,   and
thereafter the 2016 Act.
10.3.Admission to prestigious educational institutions such
as   JBIMS   must   be   granted   on   merit.   If   JBIMS   is
treated as a non­autonomous institute, and 70% of the
seats  are  reserved  for  the  Home University,  then  it
would vitiate the principle of supremacy of merit.
      On   the   other   hand,   if   JBIMS   is   treated   as   an
autonomous institute, 85% of the seats would be open
for meritorious students from all universities in the
State of Maharashtra.
11.We have carefully perused the written submissions made
by all the parties, and heard the oral submissions made by
their   respective   counsel,   including   the   learned   amicus
curiae. 
11.1.The admitted position is that JBIMS is a Department of
the   University   of   Mumbai,   and   was   granted
autonomous status by the University itself. JBIMS is
23not an affiliated college, nor a constituent college of the
University.
      This   position   has   been   accepted   by   all   parties,
including   the   State.   In   para   23   of   the   impugned
judgment, the High Court has recorded the submission
of the Advocate General for the State of Maharashtra
about the status of JBIMS as follows :­
“23….Then, Mr. Kumbhakoni was at pains to tell us
about the status of JBIMS.  He would submit that we
must   not   forget   that   JBIMS   is   a   department   of
University.   The   University   has   appointed   the   staff
and   the   University   has   sanctioned   the   budget   of
JBIMS. It is not an affiliated college, but a college
conducted   by   the   University.   It   is   not   even   a
constituent   college.   Mr.   Kumbhakoni   would   submit
that the autonomy in this case is not granted by the
UGC, but by the University of Mumbai ….”
(emphasis supplied)
      As   per   the   University   of   Mumbai   and   JBIMS,
autonomy   was   conferred   by   the   University   in
accordance   with   the   provisions   of   Maharashtra
University Act, 1994. 
11.2.The UGC in its detailed written and oral submissions
has expressly stated that JBIMS being a Department of
the University of Mumbai, was not required to apply for
autonomous status under the UGC 2018 Regulations.
The   2018   Regulations   were   applicable   to   Colleges/
Institutions   affiliated   to   Universities   in   the   country
seeking conferment of “ Autonomous College Status ”.
24     It was submitted that JBIMS is not an affiliated
college, nor a constituent college, but a department of
the University of Mumbai. The approval of the UGC is
not required if a University Department applies to the
University,   for   grant   of   autonomous   status   under
Section   122   of   the   Maharashtra   Public   Universities
Act, 2016.
11.3.JBIMS   had   informed   the   Directorate   of   Technical
Education vide letter dated 18.02.2019 that pursuant
to the decision taken in the meeting of the Board of
Management held on 15.02.2019, it was finalizing the
admission   procedure   for   the   MMS   course   for   the
academic   year   2019­2020.   It   was   requested   that
JBIMS should not be included in the CET process.   
      JBIMS   informed   the   Directorate   of   Technical
Education   that   since   it   was   a   Department   of   the
University of Mumbai, it was awaiting to receive the
extension of its autonomous status from the University
of Mumbai.
11.4.The   autonomous   status   conferred   on   JBIMS   was
granted with effect from 11.07.2014 to 11.07.2019. It
was during the subsistence of the autonomous status,
that the Directorate of Technical Education and the
CET­Cell   on   01.07.2019,   had   shown   the   status   of
JBIMS to be non­autonomous.
25      As   a   consequence,   the   entire   seat   matrix   for
admission   to   the   post­graduate   courses   in   JBIMS
underwent a complete change. As per the seat matrix
published, 70% seats would now be allocated to the
University   of   Mumbai,   to   the   exclusion   of   all   other
universities   in   the   State   of   Maharashtra.   The
remaining 15% to other Universities; and the balance
15% for the All­India Quota.
    In the aforesaid circumstances, since the application
for extension was under consideration, the Directorate
of   Technical   Education   and   the   CET­Cell   were   not
justified   in   treating   JBIMS   as   a   Non­Autonomous
Institute for the current academic year 2019­20. 
11.5.It is the admitted position that the autonomous status
granted   to   JBIMS   has   not   been   revoked,   or
surrendered. 
     The application for extension was made by JBIMS
pursuant   to   the   permission   granted   by   the   Vice
Chancellor   of   the   University   of   Mumbai.     The
application for extension is stated to be under active
consideration.
     Since JBIMS had continued to fulfill the eligibility
criteria   for   extension/renewal   of   the   autonomous
status, it is only a ministerial act which is required to
be   carried   out   by   the   University   to   issue   the
26Notification   for   grant   of   extension/renewal   of   the
autonomous status.
11.6.  It is relevant to note that even during the previous
academic   year   i.e.   2018­19,   the   Directorate   of
Technical   Education   had   issued   a   Notification,
whereby   it   amended   the   Information   Brochure,   and
allocated  100% seats  in JBIMS  to  the  Maharashtra
State quota.
   This Notification came to be challenged by a student
from the All India Quota in the case of  Mayuri Umesh
Munde  v.  Directorate   of   Technical   Education   &   Ors.
(supra), wherein the Bombay High Court held that the
100%   reservation   in   favour   of   candidates   from   the
State was illegal and impermissible. The High Court
noted that during the preceding years, the State of
Maharashtra had consistently allocated 85% seats in
Autonomous   Institutes   to   candidates   from   all
Universities   in   the   State   of   Maharashtra,   and   15%
seats to candidates from the All India Quota. 
     The High Court held that JBIMS being a premier
institution, and one of the top management colleges in
the country, was being deprived of bright meritorious
students from all over the country. This was a great
national loss, and would undermine the status of an
institution of national stature.
27    This judgment was not challenged any further, and
attained finality.
11.7.A perusal of the provisions of the Maharashtra Public
Universities Act, 2016 provide the procedure for grant
of autonomous status to departments of a University. 
    Section 2(5) of the Maharashtra Public Universities
Act, 2016 defines “autonomy” as follows :­
“2. (5) “autonomy” means a privilege of the university
conferred   by   the   Statutes   to   permit   a   college,
institution   or   a   university   department   to   conduct
academic   programmes   and   examinations,   develop
syllabus   for   the   respective   subjects   and   issue
certificates of passing the examinations;”
     Section 122 of this Act provides that a University
Department, institution, affiliated college, or recognized
institution  may apply to the  University for grant of
autonomous status. As per sub­section (1) of Section
122, the Management Council, on the recommendation
of the Academic Council, may confer the autonomous
status.
   
    
Section 122 reads as follows: ­
“122.   (1)  A   university   department   or   institution,
affiliated college or recognized institution may apply
to the university for grant of autonomous status. The
Management Council on the recommendation of the
Academic Council may confer the autonomous status.
(2)  Autonomous university department   or institution
or   affiliated   college   or   recognized   institution   shall
28function with the objectives  of  promoting academic
freedom and scholarship on the part of teachers and
students   which   are   essential   to   the   fostering   and
development of an intellectual climate conducive to
the pursuit of scholarship and excellence.
(3)   The   autonomous   university   department   or
institution   or   affiliated   college   or   recognized
institution,   may  constitute   its   authorities   or  bodies
and exercise the powers and perform the functions
and carry out the administrative, academic and other
activities of the university, as may be prescribed by
the Statutes. 
(4)  The   autonomous   university   department   or
institution   or   affiliated   college   or   recognized
institution  may prescribe its own courses of study,
evolve   its   own   teaching   methods   and   hold
examinations   and   tests   for   students   receiving
instruction in it, and recommend the university for
award   degrees,   diplomas   or   certificates,   after
following the procedure as prescribed in the Statutes .
The autonomous university department or institution
or   affiliated   college   or   recognized   institution   shall
have   full   academic   and   administrative   autonomy
subject to the provisions of this Act and Statutes and
the   guidelines   issued   by   the   University   Grant
Commission, from time to time.”
(emphasis supplied)
     The aforesaid provisions of the 2016 Act clearly
indicate that it is the University which is empowered to
grant autonomous status to its Departments. 
    Statute 604 of the University of Mumbai empowers
the University to grant autonomous status initially for
a period of 5 years, and then to extend it for a further
period of 5 years, subject to the procedure prescribed
in Statutes 598 and 600.
29    The Application for extension of autonomous status
has accordingly been made by JBIMS as a Department
of   the   University,   which   is   pending   consideration
before the University. 
12.The   decision   of   JBIMS   to   apply   for   extension   of   its
autonomous status was taken by its Board of Management
on 15.02.2019, well before the admissions process for the
MMS Course commenced for the academic year 2019­2020.
Accordingly,   the   Directorate   of   Technical   Education   was
requested not to include JBIMS in the said process. JBIMS
after some delay, had addressed a letter dated 25.05.2019 to
the   Vice   Chancellor   of   the  University   for  extension   of   its
autonomous status, which was followed up by letters dated
27.06.2019 and 28.06.2019. We observe that there was some
delay on the part of JBIMS and the University, to process the
Application for extension which led to uncertainty regarding
its continued Autonomous Status.  
      We   however   feel   that   meritorious   students   who   have
secured higher marks in the CET Examination should not be
denied admission, in view of the uncertainty which occurred.
In   our   opinion,   it   would   be   unjust   and   unfair   to   the
meritorious   Respondent­Students.   Admittedly,   JBIMS   has
enjoyed autonomous status for the last 5 years, whereby
Home University students and students from the State of
Maharashtra being covered by the 85% State quota, had an
30equal opportunity to compete for admission. It would harm
JBIMS   as   an   institution   of   national   repute,   and   cause
disillusionment   and   resentment   amongst   the   meritorious
students, if the admissions are not made on the basis of
merit in the CET. Accordingly, we direct that for the current
academic year 2019­2020, admissions would be made as per
the Judgment of the High Court.
13.The Directorate of Technical Education and the CET­Cell are
hereby   directed   to   conduct   the   admissions   process   in
accordance with the ranking of the students as per the Merit
List   published   by   CET­Cell,   by   treating   JBIMS   as   an
Autonomous Department of the University of Mumbai.
   It is therefore directed that the online admissions process
be carried out within a period of 2 weeks from the date of the
present   Order.   The   candidates   may   be   granted   1   week
thereafter   to   take   admission   in   the   respective   colleges
thereafter.
14.Keeping in view the various issues which have arisen for
consideration,   and   since   the   Writ   Petition   was   decided
without calling for counter affidavits, we deem it appropriate
to remit the matter to the High Court for determination of the
issues of law pertaining to applicability of the 2016 Act, and
the   2018   UGC   Regulations.   Since   these   issues   were   not
specifically raised before the High Court, and the UGC was
31not represented, it would be appropriate for the High Court
to consider these issues.
   We clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on the
merits of the matter. The findings rendered by us are of a
prima facie  nature, in order to ensure that the admissions
process for the current academic year 2019­2020 does not
get stalled any further.
15.We extend our gratitude to Mr. Maninder Singh, Sr. Adv. who
very   ably   assisted   this   Court   as   amicus   curiae   on   short
notice.
The Civil Appeal is accordingly disposed of.
All pending Applications, if any, are accordingly disposed of.
Ordered accordingly.

REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 3669­3670/2015
Union of India and others ..Appellants
Versus
Junu Gayary ..Respondent
J U D G M E N T
M.R. SHAH, J.
Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment
and order dated 9.6.2006 passed by the Gauhati High Court in  Writ
Petition(C) No. 9709/2003, by which the High Court has directed for
CBI investigation with respect to the death of one Someswar Gayari
alias Sombrom, as also, dismissal of review petition vide order dated
5.12.2008, the original respondents – Union of India and others have
preferred the present appeals, by way of special leave petitions.
2.That the respondent herein – Smt. Junu Gayary, a young widow
of   deceased   Someswar   Gayari   alias   Sombrom   filed   a   writ   petition
before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for
an appropriate writ, directions or order against the appellants herein –
the original respondents directing them to institute a judicial enquiry2
into   the   cause   and   the   persons   responsible   for   the   death   of   her
husband – Someswar Gayari alias Sombrom.  Further directions were
also sought for compensation of rupees six lakhs to her and her family
for their survival.
2.1It was the case on behalf of the original writ petitioner that when
her deceased husband was at his relative’s house at village Koilamaila
under Bijni Police Station, he was taken away to Bhabanipur Army
Camp by the personnel of 8th Madras Military Regiment at about 3:00
a.m. on 26.08.2003 and thereafter his whereabouts were not known
until   she   was   informed   by   the   Officer   Incharge   of   Amguri   Police
Outpost informing her that her husband had died on 30.08.2003 in an
encounter with army near Bhabanhipurgaon.
2.2The writ petition was opposed by the appellants herein – the
original respondents.  The stand taken by the original respondents in
their affidavit was that no civilian as such was brought to Bhabanipur
Army Camp as claimed by the original writ petitioner.  They took the
specific stand that the husband of the writ petitioner was killed in an
encounter, which took place at about 3:50 hrs on 30.08.2003.
2.3That   vide   order   dated   4.4.2005,   the   High   Court   directed   the
learned District & Sessions Judge, Bongaigaon to hold an enquiry with
regard to the circumstances leading to the disappearance and death of3
the original writ petitioner’s husband, Someswar Gayari.   The High
Court directed the learned District & Sessions Judge to submit the
report.  The High Court also directed the learned District & Sessions
Judge to issue appropriate notice to all the parties and provide them
an opportunity of hearing in the matter.  Thereafter, holding necessary
enquiry and giving opportunity to all concerned and after examining
the concerned witnesses and on appreciation of the entire material
available on record, the learned District & Sessions Judge submitted
its report holding that the deceased Someswar Gayari was picked up
from the house of Dilbahadur Chetry by army personnel in the night
that followed the day of 26.08.2003.  The learned District & Sessions
Judge also opined that no Assam Police Personnel were involved in the
act   of   picking   up   of   the   deceased   from   the   house   of   Dilbahadur
Chetry.  The learned District & Sessions Judge further observed that
whereabouts   of   the   deceased   was   not   known   to   the   original   writ
petitioner till she was informed by the Bijni Police Station that the
deceased died in an encounter with army.  Upon appreciation of both
direct and circumstantial evidence, the learned District & Sessions
Judge came to the conclusion that the deceased was in the custody of
the Indian Army since the time of his picking up by the army till the
time of production of the dead body and handing over the same to the4
police in the police station.   The learned District & Sessions Judge
specifically observed that the death of the deceased was in the hands
of army and an attempt, however, has been made by the army to show
the death of the deceased as if in the course of encounter between the
army and the deceased.
2.4That   thereafter   the   High   Court   gave   the   opportunity   to   the
appellants herein to file their objections, if any, to the Enquiry Report
submitted by the learned District & Sessions Judge.   However, no
such objections were preferred by the appellants herein – the original
respondents.  That thereafter after considering the submissions made
by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants herein  ­
the   original   respondents   on   the   enquiry   report   submitted   by   the
learned     District   &   Sessions   Judge,   the   High   Court   came   to   the
conclusion   that   the   deceased   –   Someswar   Gayari   was   taken   into
custody by the army for whatever purposes and probably may have
been killed while in the custody.   Therefore, the High Court by the
impugned judgment and order has directed that in view of the specific
and categorical finding recorded by the learned District & Sessions
Judge, the matter requires for further investigation in accordance with
law for which purpose a criminal case shall be registered for the
offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC.  The High Court has5
directed   the   Central   Bureau   of   Investigation   to   undertake   the
investigation so that the real culprits do not get away unpunished.
2.5Having found that there is a violation of the Article 21 of the
Constitution of India and that the original writ petitioner is a young
widow required to look after her three minor school going children and
that the deceased was the only bread earner of the family, the High
Court has further directed original respondent nos. 1 and 3 – Union of
India and Commandant, 8th  Madras Regiment to pay Rupees three
lakhs to the original writ petitioner by way of compensation for the
death of the deceased Someswar Gayari.
3.Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment(s)
and order(s) passed by the High Court, the appellants herein – original
respondents – Union of India and others have preferred the present
appeals.
4.We   have   heard   Shri   R.   Balasubramanian,   learned   Senior
Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants.  Service of notice is
complete on the respondent as per the service report received from the
concerned District Court but no one has entered appearance on behalf
of the respondent.
4.1Having heard the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of
the appellants and considering the impugned judgment and order6
passed by the High Court, as such, we see no reason to interfere with
the   impugned   judgment   and   order.     The   High   Court   has   rightly
directed to register a criminal case for the offence punishable under
Section 302 of the IPC with respect to the death of Someswar Gayari
alias Sombrom and looking to the gravity of the offence committed the
High Court has rightly directed the CBI to undertake the investigation.
For the aforesaid, the High Court has taken into consideration the
report   submitted   by   the   learned   District   &   Sessions   Judge   who
categorically   recorded   that   the   deceased   Someswar   Gayari   alias
Sombrom was picked up from the house of Dilbahadur Chetry by
army personnel in the night that followed the day of 26.08.2003; that
the deceased was in the custody of the Indian Army since the time of
his picking up by the army till the time of production of the dead body
and handing over the same to the police in the police station; that the
death of the deceased was in the hands of army and an attempt,
however,   has   been   made   by   the   army   to   show   the   death   of   the
deceased as if in the course of encounter between the army and the
deceased. The aforesaid findings recorded by the learned District &
Sessions Judge were on considering the material on record and after
examining some witnesses and after giving an opportunity even to the
appellants also. Under the circumstances, the impugned judgments7
and orders passed by the High Court directing to register a criminal
case for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC and
directing the CBI to undertake the investigation do not warrant any
interference.
5.Now   so   far   as   awarding   rupees   three   lakhs   by   way   of
compensation to the original writ petitioner is concerned, it is required
to be noted that there is a specific finding recorded by the learned
District & Sessions Judge and even by the High Court that there is a
violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The persons who are
responsible   for   the   death   of   Someswar   Gayari   shall   be   ultimately
investigated by the CBI.   However, the fact remains that Someswar
Gayari   has   died   and   there   is   a   prima   facie  finding   against   the
appellants.  In fact, the High Court has awarded rupees three lakhs
only which, according to us, is on a lower side.  According to us, if
rupees five lakhs is awarded towards compensation, at this stage, the
same shall be in the interest of justice.   Therefore, in exercise of
powers   under   Article   142   of   the   Constitution   of   India   and   to   do
substantial   justice   to   the   deceased   and   his   family   members,   we
enhance the amount of compensation to rupees five lakhs, which shall
be   deposited   by   the   appellants   with   the   Registrar   General   of   the
Gauhati High Court within a period of four weeks from today, which8
shall be paid to the original writ petitioner on her being properly
identified.  The assessment of compensation of ours shall not preclude
the original writ petitioner to avail such remedy as is available to her
in law whatsoever which may have to be decided on its own merits.
6.In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present
appeals challenging the impugned judgments and orders passed by
the High Court directing to register a criminal case and directing the
CBI to undertake the investigation deserve to be dismissed and are
accordingly dismissed.
7.Since the matter is very old, the CBI is directed to undertake and
conclude the investigation at the earliest so that the real culprits are
punished.  It goes without saying and as held by this Court in the case
of General Officer Commanding v. CBI and another, reported in (2012)6
SCC   228,  that  after the  charge  sheet  is  filed  by  the  investigating
agency   and   not   after   the   cognizance   is   taken   by   the   court,     the
competent authority in the army shall take a decision within a period
of eight weeks from the date of filing of the charge sheet as to whether
the trial would be by the criminal court or by a court martial and
communicate the same to the Chief Judicial Magistrate concerned
immediately thereafter.   In case, the option is made to try the case by
a court martial, the said proceedings would commence immediately9
and would be concluded in accordance with law expeditiously.  It is
further observed and directed that in case the option is made that the
accused will be tried by the criminal court the CBI shall make an
application to the Central Government for grant of sanction within a
period of four weeks from the receipt of such option and in case such
an   application  is   filed,   the  Central   Government   shall   take   a   final
decision on the said application within a period of eight weeks from
the date of such an application.  In case, sanction is granted by the
Central Government, the criminal court shall proceed with the trial
and conclude the same expeditiously.
8.With   the   aforesaid   observations   and   directions,   the   present
appeals are disposed of.

The respondent filed the objections, and as noticed, overruling the 
objections of the respondents, the Trial Court allowed the application 
filed by the petitioner under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code, which has 
been set aside by the High Court.  
4. The learned Counsel for the petitioner would submit that the 
original summons was served on 17.12.2013 on the mother of the 
petitioner. The Trial Court itsel f issued further summons on 23.04.2014. 
On 02.07.2014, the petitioner filed an application. Thereafter, the Suit 
came to be transferred to another Court, and thereafter, without any 
notice to the petitioner, the Suit came to be decreed.  
5. Counsel for the app ellant would submit that the property is the 
residential property. It is much more valuable than the amount shown 
in the agreement. The transaction was essentially a loan transaction 
and opportunity must be given to contest the matter on merits.  
6. Per contra , the learned Counsel for the decree holder would 
submit that ample opportunity was given to the appellant, and in spite 
of the same, he has not contested the matter. Appellant has another 
residential building. The building in question was let out on rent.  
7. Most importantly, the learned Counsel submits that after levying 
execution of the decree, the property has been conveyed to the 
respondent by the orders of the Court. In other words, sale deed has 3 
 already been executed in her favour. It is respondent’s ca se that 
appellant was served notice by the executing court.  There is no scope 
for interfering with the matter by this Court.  
8. Ordinarily, a litigation is based on adjudication on the merits of 
the contentions of the parties. Litigation should not be termi nated by 
default, either of the plaintiff or the defendant. The cause of justice does 
require that as far as possible, adjudication be done on merits.  
9.   The disputed agreement is dated 18.04.2012. Summons was 
issued and it was received but according to the  appellant, by his 
mother. The Trial Court has apparently accepted the case of the 
appellant that the mother did not bring the receipt of the summons to 
the notice of the appellant and that it was sometime in June, 2014 that 
the appellant can be credited w ith knowledge of the Suit. The Order 
dated 02.07.2014 reads as follows:  
 
“On behalf of the plaintiff ex -parte evidence 
by way of affidavit (20A2) is filed.  
The ex -parte proceeding against the 
defendant is allowed.  
The application is submitted to engage an 
advocate by the defendant. However, the suit is 
declared ex -parte evidence, therefore, the same is 
rejected. Now the matter is fixed for ex -parte 
argument on dated 08.08.2014.”  
 
 
10.  Order further appears to reveal that the plaintiff was present in 
person. The plaintiff has filed his proof affidavit. It was decided to 
proceed against the appellant ex parte . There is, however, a reference 4 
 to the application to engage an advocate by the appellant. The case 
stood posted for ex parte  argument on 08.08.20 14. As parties were not 
present on the said day, the case was posted to 15.09.2014. However, 
on 12.09.2014, the case stood transferred to another Court. No 
intimation was given under Rule 89A to the appellant.  
11.  The further case of the appellant is that he came to know from the 
plaintiff that the case was fixed for judgement on 17.11.2015. He has 
alleged that he contacted his counsel but he did not get a satisfactory 
reply. He also has a case that he appeared on 17.11.2015 in court, and 
then, he only came to  know that judgement was rendered on 
09.10.2014. A new counsel was engaged on 26.11.2015. Thereafter, the 
application was filed.  
 
12. One fact stands out and that is, that the appellant came to be 
served notice of the execution proceedings through said messeng er 
on 27.03.2015.  Thus, the case of the appellant that appellant came to 
know about the passing of the decree only on 17.11.2015, cannot be 
acted upon.  This is besides noticing that in execution of the decree, 
the sale deed has been executed in favour of  the respondent and it is 
only thereafter that despite receipt of the notice dated 27.03.2015, the 
appellant has set up the case that he came to know of the passing of the 
decree only several months thereafter.  5 
 13. The matter arises from a suit for specific pe rformance.  It may be 
true that there is a case for the respondent that the appellant has 
actually let out the building on rent.  The appellant’s case is that this is 
the appellant’s residential house and the matter is a loan transaction.   
Specific relief  is undoubtedly a discretionary relief.  Appellant has 
submitted that the appellant is prepared to deposit the entire amount 
spent by the respondent towards getting sale deed executed.  We 
would think that the interest of justice demands that subject to pu tting 
the appellant on terms, an opportunity should be given to the appellant 
to contest the case and the case must be directed to be disposed of 
within the time limit.  Accordingly, we allow the appeal and set aside 
the impugned order subject to the follo wing conditions:  
(a) The appellant will deposit a sum of Rs.67,400/ - (Rs.57,400/ - 
towards stamp duty paid by the respondent + Rs.10,000/ - 
towards registration expenses etc.) within a period of one 
month from today in the Execution Court.   
(b) The appellant will further deposit a sum of Rs.50,000/ - as costs 
to be paid to the respondents.  This amount will also be 
deposited in the Execution Court within a period of one month 
from today.  
 Upon depositing the aforesaid amounts, it will be open to the 
respondent to withdraw the same and the sale deed  will stand 
set aside.  The respondent can also withdraw the amount of 6 
 Rs.92,000/ - deposited by him towards balance sale 
consideration.  In case the amounts as aforesaid are not 
deposited within the stipulat ed period, the appeal will stand 
dismissed and the impugned order will stand confirmed.  
(c) We further direct that if the appellant complies with the 
conditions as aforesaid, the trial Court will take up the suit and 
dispose of the same as expeditiously as pos sible but at any 
rate within a period of six months from the date on which the 
respondent brings the fulfilment of the aforesaid conditions to 
the notice of the trial Court.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 579 OF 2016
UNION OF INDIA & ORS. ...APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
CDR. RAVINDRA V. DESAI …..RESPONDENT(S)
W I T H
 
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 574 OF 2016
J U D G M E N T
A.K. SIKRI, J.
These two are cross appeals filed by both the parties to the
lis.  On the one hand is the Union of India, along with the Chief of
Naval  Staff  as  well  as  the  Flag  Officer,  Commanding-in-Chief,
Headquarters, Western Naval Command (hereinafter referred to as
the  ‘appellants’).   On  the  other  hand  is  Commander  Ravindra  V.
Desai, a naval officer with Indian Navy (hereinafter referred to as the
‘respondent’).  
2.On certain allegations against the respondent, he was served with
charge-sheet containing ten charges which led to the court martial
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 1 of 29proceedings against him.  Court Martial returned the finding of ‘guilty’
on all charges which led to imposition of sentence of dismissal from
the  naval  service  as  well  as  forfeiture  of  24  calender  months  of
seniority.  After exhausting departmental remedies, the respondent
challenged its conviction before the Armed Forces Tribunal (for short,
‘AFT’).  Finding certain reasons stated at the appropriate stage, the
AFT decided to itself record the evidence on those  charges by giving
opportunities to both the parties.  On the basis of evidence produced
before the AFT, the AFT set aside the finding of ‘guilty’ in respect of
three charges (8th, 9th and 10th charges) on the ground of misjoinder of
charges  holding  that  it  had  no  connection  with  charges  1  to  7.
However, in respect of charges 1 to 7, the AFT maintained that the
appellant could successfully prove these charges by cogent evidence.
The  AFT,  thereafter,  proceeded  to  consider  the  quantum  of
punishment and came to the conclusion that the punishment of a
‘dismissal from service’ is disproportionate to the nature of charges.  It
also  observed  that  when  the  respondent  had  been  awarded  the
punishment of ‘dismissal from service’, second punishment, namely,
forfeiture of seniority for 24 months did not  make any sense. On
these grounds, the AFT set aside the punishment of ‘dismissal from
the service’ and held that interest of justice would be met  if only the
punishment of ‘forfeiture of seniority of 24 months’ is inflicted upon the
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 2 of 29respondent.  It has, accordingly, directed the appellants to reinstate
the respondent in naval service without payment of any salary for the
intervening  period,  i.e.,  the  back  wages.   Both  the  parties  feel
aggrieved  by  this  judgment.   In  the  first  instance,  they  moved
application  before  the  AFT  seeking  leave  to  appeal.   The  AFT
declined  this  request  stating  that  no  question  of  law  of  public
importance is involved.  This is the reason for both the parties to
approach this Court.  These appeals were clubbed together.  In the
appeal, filed by the respondent while issuing notice, operation of the
order of the AFT was also stayed.  As a result, the respondent has not
been allowed to join back the service.  Both these appeals were
admitted  formally  on  July  01,  2016  and  direction  was  given  to
expedite the hearing.  It was also directed that interim order shall
continue to operate.  This is how the appeals have come up for final
hearing in which both the sides were heard at length.
3.With the aforesaid introductory remarks, we now proceed to narrate
the factual matrix of the case in some more detail.  The respondent
was  commissioned  in  Indian  Navy  on  January  01,  1998  as  Sub.
Lieutenant. He was promoted to the rank of Commander on January
16, 2011.  At that time, he was posted as the Executive Officer of INS
Mahish at Port Blair in Andaman Island.  His aforesaid posting was
from May, 2010 to June, 2011.  In June, 2011, he was transferred to
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 3 of 29INS Viraat as Commander Operations vide orders dated June 02,
2011.  In obedience to the said orders, the respondent along with his
wife  and  daughters  left  for  Mumbai  on  June  15,  2011.   The
respondent  joined  duties  at  the  transferred  place  with  10  days’
leave/joining time.  He had undertaken the  aforesaid journey from
Port Blair to Mumbai by Indian Airlines.  According to him, on reaching
Mumbai he stayed with his sister-in-law Amita Gavankar at Goregaon,
Mumbai as he was on leave till June 25, 2011.  From June 16, 2011
to June 19, 2011, he visited different places in Maharashtra and even
went to Goa with his family.  On June 25, 2011, he shifted to the
official accommodation, i.e., Integrated Mess Sports Complex Cottage
No. 1, along with his wife and daughter, which accommodation was
allotted to him at that time.  On June 26, 2011, he reported to INS
Taragiri, the waiting ship for INS Viraat, as INS Viraat was berth at
Kochi at that time. On June 29, 2011, he reported for duty at INS
Viraat at Kochi.
4.It may be mentioned, at this stage, that according to him he had
earlier purchased two mobile sim cards for mobile hand sets when he
was posted at INS Mahish, Port Blair.  One from BSNL with no.
9476045470 for himself and 2nd from Vodafone South Limited with no.
9564784782 for his wife.  Again, according to him, on 19th June, 2011
when he had come to Mumbai, he purchased two sim cards from Idea
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 4 of 29Cellular Pvt. Ltd., one having 8108770020 for himself and other no.
8108770030 which was meant for his wife.
5.On July 01, 2011 at about 22.45 hours, he was woken up from his
sleep and escorted by Commander Manoj Jha (PW-20) to Captain
Hari Kumar, the Commanding Officer of INS Viraat.  Captain Hari
Kumar questioned him about mobile no. 9564784782, as sexually
explicit calls were received from the same number by wives of some
naval officers. He explained that this sim card remained in possession
of his wife through out who had used the same.  Search was made
but no such sim card was found with the respondent. His mobile
telephone no. 8108770020 was confiscated and detailed for 18 hours
whereafter, on the next day, it was returned back to him. Thereafter,
One Man Inquiry (for short, ‘OMI’) was ordered on January 05, 2012.
This  OMI  was  conducted  with  effect  from  January  11,  2012  and
concluded on January 31, 2012.  Thereupon, the respondent was
issued a charge sheet dated September 05, 2012 for trial by Court
Martial. Ten charges were framed against the respondent.  Seven out
of which were under Section 77(2) of the Navy Act, 1957 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘the Act”) read with Section 509 of the Indian Penal
Code (‘IPC’) and three charges were framed against the respondent
under Sections 58, 74 and 48(c) of the Navy Act.  These charges
pertained  to  the  alleged  obscene  calls  purportedly  made  by  the
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 5 of 29respondent to the three ladies.
6.It  is  on  the  findings  of  the  OMI,  Headquarters  Western  Naval
Command directed the Commanding Officer, INS Kunjali where the
respondent  was  attached  for  the  investigation,  to  investigate  and
record Summary of Evidence (SoE) of prosecution witnesses.
7.On September 05, 2012, the Commanding Officer, INS Kunjali read
the charges mentioned in the charge sheet and the respondent was
given  a  chance  to  file  reply  thereto,  which  he  did.   Thereafter,
decision was taken that the respondent be brought to trial of the Court
Martial. In the Court Martial, the prosecution examined 33 witnesses
and produced 40 documents which were exhibited.   The court called
for five witnesses as co-witnesses and exhibited 19 documents as
‘exhibits’ (C-1 to C-19).  After the conclusion of the trial, finding of
‘guilty’  was  returned  in  respect  of  all  the  10  charges  and  the
punishment  was  awarded  as  mentioned  above.   Thereafter,  the
appellant filed O.A. before the Tribunal.
8.The facts which have been noted upto now would demonstrate that
main allegation against the respondent was that he had made explicit
sexual calls to three ladies, namely, Mrs. Reena Chandel (PW-9),
Mrs. Aditi Barathwal (PW-12) and Mrs. Pallavi Tiwari (PW-18), who
are wives of three officers of Navy.  These calls were made from
Vodafone Cell Phone No. 9564784782.  Further, these calls were
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 6 of 29made on their landline numbers which were provided by NOFRA
Exchange  installed  and  operated  by  NOFRA  (Naval  Officers
Residential Area).  Each of the officers residing in the area is provided
with an extension number from the Exchange of NOFRA.  They were
not knowing the person making the calls.  They complained to their
husbands, who, in turn, reported to their senior officers and finally, all
the sexually explicit calls made to these three ladies were traced to
Mobile No. 9564784782.  These calls were made to Reena Chandel
on June 21, 2011 in the night, on June 22, 2011 in the morning, on
June 23, 2011 in the afternoon and the last call was made to her on
June 30, 2011 in the morning at 06:57.  Her extension number was
222217.  Thirteen calls were made to Mrs. Pallavi (PW-18) during the
night  between  June  31,  2011  and  July  01,  2011.   PW-12  Aditi
received similar calls twice in the night on June 30, 2011.  According
to the prosecution, all the calls were traced through the record of
NOFRA Exchange to Mobile No. 9564784782 registered in the name
of the accused.  Initially, the Naval Authorities or the officers operating
NOFRA Exchange had no knowledge as to whom the said mobile
belonged.  Therefore, it was difficult for them to trace the person
making the calls.  They approached the Deputy Commissioner of
Police, Zone I, Mumbai, who made inquiries from several service
providers about the said mobile number.  Finally, it was revealed that
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 7 of 29the said mobile was registered in the name of the respondent with
Vodafone South Limited, having office in Kolkata.
9.In order to prove the aforesaid charge, the appellants were required
to establish the aforesaid ingredients:
(a)The respondent possessed, at the relevant time, Vodafone
Cell Phone No. 9564784782.
(b)Obscene Calls were made to the landline numbers of the
three ladies and on the dates mentioned above.
(c)These calls originated from Mobile No. 9564784782 and were
made by the respondent and none else.
10.Insofar as first ingredient is concerned, it has been admitted by the
respondent himself that he was having Cell Phone with Vodafone
Connection  and  the  sim  card  was  provided  with  phone  number
9564784782.  The defence of the respondent, however, was that on
the relevant dates, the respondent was not having this number and, in
fact, the sim card had been lost and a report regarding the loss of sim
card was made to the Police.  Details of his explanation, in this
behalf, are that when the respondent was posted at Port Blair in
Andaman and Nicobar Islands, he had purchased two mobile sim
cards for mobile handsets: one from BSNL with No. 9476045470 for
himself  and  the  second  from  Vodafone  South  Limited  with  No.
9564784782 for his wife, Mrs. Pallavi Desai.  In June, 2011, he was
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 8 of 29transferred and posted to INS Viraat as Commander Operations vide
order dated June 02, 2011.  Pursuant to the said transfer orders, after
reaching  Mumbai,  he  purchased  two  Idea  sim  cards  from  Idea
Cellular  Private  Limited  on  June  19,  2011,  having  number
8108770020 for himself and 8108770030 for his wife.  He claimed
that he destroyed his mobile sim card No. 9476045470 and replaced
the same with new mobile sim No. 8108770020.  He also claimed to
have advised his wife to replace her old sim No. 9564784782 by the
new mobile sim No. 8108770030.  According to him, when officers
visited his cabin while he was at INS, Viraat at Kochi on July 01, 2011
and inquired him about Mobile No. 9564784782, he explained that
the said number was used throughout by his wife.  Thereafter, when
he called his wife, he was informed that said sim card was missing
from her purse.  Then, he advised his wife to lodge a report with the
Police and inform the service provider which she did on July 04,
2011.  It is also his case that when the officers searched his cabin,
they could not find that sim card with the respondent which shows
that the said sim card was not with the respondent and, therefore, he
could not have used the sim to make the purported obscene calls.
11.It is clear from the above that the respondent has admitted the fact
that  he  had  purchased  sim  card  from  Vodafone  with  Mobile  No.
9564784782.  However, according to him, this sim card was not with
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 9 of 29him  and  was  being  used  by  his  wife.   Moreover,  after  he  had
purchased another sim card on reaching Mumbai, this sim card was
not  used  and  was  ultimately  found  missing  even  from  his  wife
custody.  The aforesaid explanation of the respondent has not been
accepted either by the GCM or the AFT, and rightly so.
12.The reason for discarding the explanation of the respondent is that he
has  been  taking  inconsistent  stands  in  this  behalf.   Before  the
Commanding Officer, the respondent had stated that he had thrown
away his sim card in Goregaon and, therefore, he could not have
used this sim card at the relevant time i.e. on the dates of alleged
incident when the obscene calls were made.  On the other hand,
when the show cause notice has been issued to the respondent on
July 02, 2011, in response thereto, in his deposition, the respondent
took up the position that his wife has kept the sim card in his purse
and could have dropped it while travelling.
Apart from the aforesaid contradictory versions given by the
respondent himself, one particular piece of evidence produced by the
appellants clinches the issue.  It is noticed by the AFT that as per
report dated July 04, 2011 (Ex. P-29) lodged  by the wife of  the
respondent  on  July  04,  2011,  the  sim  card  was  lost  sometime
between 6 pm on June 20, 2011 to June 25, 2011.  However, even
after June 20, 2011, calls were made from this mobile number to Cdr.
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 10 of 29Arjun Kumar (PW-33) and Cdr. Arjun Kumar deposed that he has
received these calls from the respondent.  This aspect is discussed
by the AFT in the following manner:
“If  we  go  by  this  report  lodged  by  the  wife  of  the  accused,  it
appears that the said SIM card was lost in transit sometimes from
6.00  p.m.  of  20th to  25th June,  2011.   Now,  according  to  the
accused,  from  19th June,  2011,  the  SIM  card  of  his  wife  was
replaced by the new card and sometimes between the evening of
20th June,  2011  till  25th June,  2011,  the  old  SIM  card  of
9564784782 was lost.  If it is so, this number could not have been
used for making any call at least from 21st June, 2011 onwards.  On
perusal of the CDR, Exhibit T-2, it appears that on 20th June, 2011
at 13.29 hours, a call was made from this mobile number to mobile
No.  9619796549,  which  was  the  mobile  number  of  Cdr.  Arjun
Kumar.  The record also shows that on 20th June, 2011 itself at
18.31 hours, again, there was a call from the said mobile to the
above referred mobile number of Cdr. Arjun Kumar.  There was
also call from the said mobile of the accused to the mobile of Cdr.
Arjun Kumar on 23rd June, 2011 at 11.46 hours. On 25th June, 2011
at 09.50 hours and 15.06 hours, again, there were two calls from
the said mobile No. 9564784782 to mobile No. 9619796549 of Cdr.
Arjun Kumar.  Again, there were three calls from the said mobile
number to the mobile of Cdr. Arjun Kumar on 28th June, 2011
between  17.15  to  17.55  hours.   PW-33  Cdr.  Arjun  Kumar  has
deposed on oath that he had received these calls and that the
accused was in contact with him on all these days from his mobile.
It shows that the said mobile was being used by the accused even
after 25th June, 2011.  Cdr. Arjun Kumar had no reason to falsely
depose that he had received the calls from the accused on these
days.” 
Dr. Sharma had made extensive argument in endeavour to
dislodge the creditworthiness of Cdr. Arjun Kumar.  However, in our
view, his deposition remains unshaken and credible.
13.Another interesting evidence which have surfaced and which nails the
respondent on this aspect is that as per the respondent himself, he
had proceeded to Kochi on June 29, 2011 to join the duty on INS
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 11 of 29Viraat.  For this purpose, he had left Mumbai on June 29, 2011 by Air
India AI-681 flight which left Mumbai at 5:30 pm and arrived Kochi at
7:20 pm on June 29, 2011.  One of the calls was made from this
phone at 05:01 pm from Mumbai area.  Thereafter, another call was
made from this very phone on the same day at 08:01 pm from Kerala
area.    At 05:01 pm, when the call was made from Mumbai, the
respondent was in Mumbai and his flight left Mumbai at 05:30 pm.
He had reached Kochi at 07:20 pm and another call is made at 08:01
pm.  This also shows that the Cell Phone with the aforesaid number
was with the respondent only.  The AFT has lucidly discussed this
aspect in the following manner:
“He claims to have left Mumbai on 29th June, 2011 by Air India AI-
681 flight.  Exhibit P-S is the flight details and the Boarding Pass
shows that the boarding time was 17.05 hrs.  The flight details
show that AI-681 flight left Mumbai at 5.30 p.m. and arrived Kochi
at 7.20 p.m. on 29th June, 2011.  Going back to the CDR, it is
revealed that on 29th June, 2011, the said call was made from the
said mobile of the accused at 17.01 hrs.  The record clearly shows
that the call was made from Vodafone Mumbai area.  Thereafter,
the next call from the said mobile of the accused on 29th June,
2011  at  20.01  hrs.  was  made  and  that  call  was  made  from
Vodafone Kerala area.  Thereafter, all the calls on 29th and 30th
June and 1st July, 2011 are made from the said mobile of the
accused  from  Vodafone  Kerala  area.   Admittedly,  during  that
period, the accused was at Kochi.  If the said SIM Card was found
by some other person and he was using the SIM card, he could not
travelled along with the accused at the same time and in the same
flight.  This document produced by the accused himself goes to
prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the said mobile was
being used by the accused and none else and, therefore, it must be
held that all the sexually explicit calls to the three ladies were made
by the accused from his said mobile and none else.”
 
14.We are, therefore, of the opinion that the prosecution has been able
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 12 of 29to give satisfactory proof to prove that when the offending calls in
question were made, the Cell Phone with Mobile No. 9564784782
was with the respondent.
15.Coming to the second  ingredient,  in order to  prove that  sexually
explicit calls were received by the wives of the three officers, the
prosecution  produced  these  ladies  as  PW-9,  PW-12  and  PW-18.
They have explained in detail having received these calls and the
offending language.  To show that the calls were received from the
aforesaid phone which belongs to the respondent, the prosecution
had produced Call Data Record (CDR) of NOFRA land line numbers.
Cdr. Anurag Saxena, Officer-in-Charge of NOFRA who appeared as
PW-3 probe the said CDRs of NOFRA Telephone Exchange showing
that all the calls had originated from Mobile No. 9564784782.  He also
produced Exh. P-10, which is the certificate issued by him to the
effect that the land line numbers of the three female victims were
provided  by  the  NOFRA  Telephone  Exchange.   He  specifically
deposed that true and correct call records have been produced and
there is no reason to disbelieve that.
16.We now advert to the third ingredient.  From the evidence discussed
above, it stands established that calls were made from Cell Phone
No. 9564784782.  However, some controversy has arisen in respect
of CDRs produced from the service provider, namely, Vodafone South
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 13 of 29Mumbai and the respondent is trying to take advantage thereof.  In
this behalf, it may be mentioned that in the NOFRA records, though
Cell Phone No. 9564784782 is rightly mentioned, the said phone
number is displayed as belonging to Idea network.  On that basis, it
was argued that NOFRA CDRs could not have been relied upon.
However,  it  needs  to  be  recorded  that  the  appellants  had  given
satisfactory explanations for the aforesaid mistake.  It was explained
before the AFT that the mobile number of the respondent had been
erroneously shown as an Idea Cell Number due to feeding of Code
“95” as that of Idea Cell in the system of NOFRA.  This was also
clarified by Mr. Fernandes who appeared as CW-2.  He was the
Programmer of the NOFRA system.  It is significant to point out that
there is no cross-examination by the respondent on this point.  The
discussion of the AFT, on this aspect, runs as follows:
“The learned counsel for the accused pointed out that as per call
record  from  NOFRA,  vide  Exhibit  P-8  for  Extension  No.  7000,
Exhibit P-9 for Extension No. 7164 and Exhibit P-10 for Extension
No. 6328, service provider of said Mobile No. 9564784782 was
Idea Cell.  He contended that in view  of this record, the CDR
Exhibit  P-27  or  Exhibit  T-2  from  Vodafone  South  cannot  be
believed.   However,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents
contended that it was wrongly shown that said Mobile Number was
of Idea Cell and this mistake had occurred due to feeding of Code
“95” as of Idea Cell in the system of NOFRA.  This fact is clarified
by  CW-2  Fernandes,  who  was  the  Programmer  for  NOFRA
System.  The learned counsel for the accused contended that the
accused was not given opportunity to cross-examine the Court-
witnesses and, therefore, the evidence of  CW-2 Fernandes is
liable to be rejected.  During the trial, the accused was defended by
a lawyer.  The accused and his advocate were present at the time
of recording of evidence of the Court-witnesses.  There is nothing
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 14 of 29to show  that the advocate wanted to cross-examine the Court-
witnesses  but  he  was  not  allowed.   The  evidence  of  CW-2
Fernandes has gone unchallenged.  CDR Exhibit T-2 is proved by
TW-1  Sabir  Kumar  Deb,  as  discussed  earlier.   Therefore,  no
importance needs to be given to the wrong information in NOFRA
record that the mobile number was of Idea Cell.”  
It is also pertinent to note that apart from raising the dispute
that NOFRA record shows that it was Idea Cell number, it is not
disputed  that  phone  number  in  question  as  recorded  in  NOFRA
system is the same which belongs to the respondent.  It is only the
description of the phone number that had been erroneously displayed
as Idea Cell which aspect has been satisfactorily explained by the
appellants.  It would be of no significance, inasmuch as same Cell
number could not belong to both the Idea as well as Vodafone.  
17.One  aspect  remains  to  be  discussed.   In  the  Court  Martial
proceedings, officer from Vodafone South Mumbai was produced who
had brought the CDR of the Cell Phone in question to prove that calls
were made from this phone.  The said officer was examined as PW-
13 and CDR record produced by him was marked as Exh. P-27.
However, before the AFT, the respondent had raised the objection
that Exh. P-27 did not have any evidentiary value as Certificate under
Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 produced by PW-13
was in relation to customer agreement and not for CDR and that PW-
13 was Nodal Officer for Vodafone Mumbai and not for Vodafone
South.  In view of the aforesaid technical objection, the appellants
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 15 of 29filed an application under Section 17 of the Armed Forces Tribunal
Act, 2007 for summoning Nodal Officer, Mumbai Sector, Vodafone
along with a direction to produce the CDR of the mobile number of
the respondent.  Order dated November 20, 2014 was passed on this
application whereby prayer contained in the application was allowed
and summons issued to the Nodal Officer, Mumbai Sector, Vodafone
for  production  of  CDR  of  the  mobile  number  belonging  to  the
respondent along with the Certificate under Section 65-B of the Indian
Evidence  Act,  1872.   This  order  was  not  challenged  by  the
respondent.  In response to the summons issued by the AFT on
November 10, 2014, Vodafone South Limited, Kolkata had submitted
the CDR as well as the Customer Agreement of the respondent along
with the certificate under Section 65-B which came to be exhibited as
Exhibit T-3.  However, the AFT was not satisfied with the format in
which  Exhibit  T-3  had  been  made  available  by  Vodafone  South
Limited.  In its order dated February 26, 2015, the AFT categorically
observed that the CDR (Exhibit T-3) made available to the AFT was
identical to the previous CDR (Exhibit P-27) in respect of the serial
number of calls, the A Number (i.e. the number from which the calls
had originated) and the B Number (the number to which the call had
been made), the year, time and duration of the call.  However, certain
details such as the date, time, month etc. were missing from the said
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 16 of 29CDR  (Exhibit T-3).  Further, Section 65-B certificate did not bear the
designation of the person who had signed the certificate.  As such,
vide  order dated February 26,  2015,  the AFT directed the  Nodal
Officer, Vodafone South to produce before the Tribunal the complete
CDR of the said Mobile phone number for the period from June 01,
2011 to July 04, 2011 along with the Customer Agreement and the
Certificate under Section 65-B before the AFT.  The concerned official
of Vodafone had also been directed to be present before the Tribunal
on  March  03,  2015.   In  compliance  Mr.  Subir  Kumar  Deb  from
Vodafone appeared as TW-1 before the AFT and explained that it is
only due to improper alignment etc. that certain information had been
omitted  from  being  generated  in  the  CDR  Exhibit  T-3.   He  also
explained that sometimes because of the failure of the linking system
in the server, some information may not come out.  However, the AFT
decided not to take into consideration the CDR Exhibit T-3.  In terms
of the order dated February 26, 2015 of the AFT, Mr. Sudhir Kumar
Deb, official of Vodafone India, appeared before the AFT as TW-1.
The  AFT  has  recorded  the  testimony  of  TW-1  in  relation  to  the
manner in which the CDRs are stored by Vodafone in the Centralized
Server located at Pune.  TW-1 also produced before the Tribunal –
the CDR of the Mobile number of the respondent (Exhibit T-2) along
with the Certificate under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act,
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 17 of 291872 (Exhibit T-1).  CDR Exhibit T-2 along with the certificate under
Section 65-B being Exhibit T-1 duly proved by TW-1.  In his cross-
examination, TW-1 had inter alia stated that whereas CDR Exhibit T-3
(submitted to the AFT in December, 2014) had been generated on
November 01, 2011, Exhibit T-2 had been generated on March 02,
2015  and  had  been  signed  and  certified  by  TW-1.   The  alleged
discrepancy in CDR Exhibit T-2 sought to be pointed out during his
cross-examination  was  also  duly  explained  by  TW-1.   He  had
explained  that  after  2011,  as  per  guidelines  issued  by  DoT,
Government of India, the format of the CDR had been changed.  After
considering the testimony of TW-1, AFT has observed that Exhibit T-
2, submitted by TW-1, is reliable and is properly stored and generated
in the Centralized Server of Vodafone, as under:
“However, Subir Kumar Deb deposed on oath and explained that
though  the  CDR,  Exhibit  T-3,  was  submitted  with  certificate  in
December, 2014, the heading of the same clearly shows that it was
generated on November 01, 2011, while the CDR, Exhibit T-2,
signed and certified by him, was generated on March 2, 2015, after
receipt of summons from this Tribunal.  He explained that if the
specific command is given for header or heading of the call data for
the target mobile number, i.e., the mobile number about which the
call data is to be generated, the period, the date and the time of
generation are printed and in such case, the first column is always
the serial number of the calls.  But if that command is not given the
heading  and  the  serial  number  column  are  not  printed.   He
explained  that  everyday  hundreds  of  CDRs  are  generated  and
printed and possibly, while taking the print of the CDR, Exhibit T-2,
he  had  not  given  the  command  for  header  or  heading  and,
therefore, heading as well as column for serial number is missing
from the CDR, Exhibit T-2.  He further explained that after 2011, as
per the guidelines issued by the Government of India, Department
of Tele-Communications, the format of CDR has been changed and
as per the said guidelines, missed calls are also required to be
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 18 of 29deleted from the CDR.  He pointed out that these missed calls in
respect of SMS are still maintained because from the SMS, the
company generates revenue, while no such revenue is generated
from the missed calls.  Therefore, the missed calls, which were
shown as ‘Null’ or ‘Nil’ call time in the earlier record, are not shown
in the present record, but such ‘Null’ record about the SMS is still
maintained.  It appears that the column for ‘Call Time’ has been
shifted from the 9th column to 3rd column due to change in format.
In view of the explanation given by witness Subir Kumar Deb, we
are satisfied that the CDR, Exhibit T-2, now submitted by him, is
reliable and it is properly stored and generated in the Centralised
Server, as deposed by him.  We do not find any major defect and
the minor changes and the differences in the earlier record and the
present record, Exhibit T-2, are properly explained by the witness.”
18.We are in agreement with the aforesaid findings.  Learned counsel for
the appellants rightly argued that non-production of the certificate
under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 on an earlier
occasion was a curable defect which stood cured.  Law in this behalf
has been settled by the judgment of this Court in Sonu alias Amar v.
State of Haryana1, which can be traced to the following discussion in
the said judgment:
“32.  It is nobody’s case that CDRs which are a form of electronic
record are not inherently admissible in evidence.  The objection is
that they were marked before the trial court without a certificate as
required by Section 65-B(4).  It is clear from the judgments referred
to supra that an objection relating to the mode or method of proof
has to be raised at the time of marking of the document as an
exhibit and not later.  The crucial test, as affirmed by this Court, is
whether the defect could have been cured at the stage of marking
the  document.   Applying  this  test  to  the  present  case,  if  an
objection  was  taken  to  the  CDRs  being  marked  without  a
certificate,  the  Court  could  have  given  the  prosecution  an
opportunity to rectify the deficiency .  It is also clear from the above
judgments  that  objections  regarding  admissibility  of  documents
which are per se inadmissible can be taken even at the appellate
stage.  Admissibility of a document which is inherently inadmissible
is an issue which can be taken up at the appellate stage because it
1(2017) 8 SCC 570
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 19 of 29is a fundamental issue.  The mode or method of proof is procedural
and objections, if not taken at the trial, cannot be permitted at the
appellate  stage.   If  the  objections  to  the  mode  of  proof  are
permitted to be taken at the appellate stage by a party, the other
side does not have an opportunity of rectifying the deficiencies.
The learned Senior Counsel for the State referred to statements
under Section 161 CrPC, 1973 as an example of documents falling
under the said category of inherently inadmissible evidence.  CDRs
do not fall in the said category of documents.  We are satisfied that
an  objection  that  CDRs  are  unreliable  due  to  violation  of  the
procedure prescribed in Section 65-B(4) cannot be permitted to be
raised at this stage as the objection relates to the mode or method
of proof.
(emphasis added)”
19.We  may  point  out,  at  this  stage,  that  when  the  AFT  found  the
technical defect in Exhibit T-2, it was in support of Section 65-B of the
Indian Evidence Act. The AFT had summoned the record in exercise
of its power contained in Section 17 of the Act.
“17.  Powers of the Tribunal on appeal under section 15.—
The Tribunal, while hearing and deciding an appeal under Section
15, shall have the power—
(a)to order production of documents or exhibits connected with
the proceedings before the court-martial;
(b)to order the attendance of the witnesses;
(c)to receive evidence;
(d) to obtain reports from court-martial;
(e)order reference of any question for inquiry;
(f)appoint a person with special expert knowledge to act as an
assessor; and
(g)to determine any question which is necessary to be 
determined in order to do justice in the case.”
20.It was argued by the learned ASG appearing for the Union of India
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 20 of 29that powers conferred upon the AFT under Section 17 of the Act are
similar to the powers of the Industrial Tribunal/Labour Court specified
in Section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act and, therefore, judgment
of this Court in  United Planters Association of Southern India  v.
K.G.  Sangameswaran  and  another2  explaining  the  powers  of
Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal would be applicable to AFT as well.
However, we need not go into this question in these proceedings
inasmuch as the learned counsel appearing for respondent did not
question  the  powers  of  the  AFT  to  summon  the  records  from
Vodafone and permitting the parties to lead evidence before it as well
as  examining  the  said  evidence.   Thus,  in  the  absence  of  any
question mark put up by the learned counsel for the respondent to the
course of action taken by the AFT, we proceed on the basis that this
exercise was validly done.
21.Dr. Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the respondent had taken
pains to point out certain discrepancies in Exhibit T-2 as well as
Exhibit P-27 and had, on that, basis, made a fervent plea that such
documents had no credence or evidentiary value and, therefore, AFT
had committed a serious error in relying upon these documents.  It is
not necessary to pinpoint the alleged discrepancies which according
to Dr. Sharma had occurred in these documents as we find that these
are  suitably  take  care  of  by  the  Tribunal  itself  and  the  above
2(1997) 4 SCC 741
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 21 of 29discussion  as  well  as  the  discussion  contained  hereinafter  would
reflect the nature of so-called discrepancies and the answer thereto
by  the  AFT.   After  purpose  would  be  served  by  reproducing  the
following portion of the orders dated February 26, 2015 passed by
AFT  after  the  official  of  the  Vodafone  South  Limited,  Kolkata
produced  the  CDR  as  well  as  documents  pertaining  to  customer
agreement  of  the  respondent  pertaining  to  his  mobile  umber
9564784782 along with certificate under Section 65-B of the Indian
Evidence Act.
“2.After receipt of the said record, we have carefully
perused the Call Data Record submitted with the aforesaid
certificate dated 10th December, 2014, as well as the earlier
Call  Data  Record  purporting  to  have  been  issued  by
Vodafone,  along  with  the  Customer  Agreement  on  26th
December, 2012.  on careful perusal and comparison of
both the records, we have noted that in the record supplied
earlier during the Court-Martial proceedings, against every
call,  the  date  was  mentioned  in  full  like  o1-Jun-2011”.
However, in the column for the date in the date which is
now supplied, against all the entries, except the entry dated
“01-Jul-2011”, the dates are missing.  Only year ‘2011’ is
shown.  In the prescribed proforma of the data, there are
columns for “First Cell ID A”, “Last Cell ID A’, “IMEI” and
“IMSI” also.  In the previous record, the information under
all the four heads was provided against each call entry.
However,  that  information  is  completely  missing  in  The
record, which is now supplied to us.  The record purports to
have  been  stored  on  the  designated  hard  disk  of  the
computer/system of Vodafone South Limited and the data,
which is supplied to us, purports to have been generated
by  the  computer  automatically.   In  view  of  this  system,
when certain data has been stored, it must be completely
generated which the hard copy is required to be taken.
Only some of the record cannot be lost.  For example, if the
full date is generated, the date and the month cannot be
lost if year “2011” remains.  Similarly, the data under the
four heads, viz., First Cell ID A, Last Cell ID A, IMEI and
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 22 of 29IMSI, could not be lost.  Either the whole of the record
could have been lost or no part of it could be lost.  The Call
Data Record, which is supplied to us now, s identical with
the previous record in respect  of the serial number of the
calls, a number, i.e., Number of the Mobile Phone to which
the call is made, year, time and duration of the call are
shown.  We fail to understand why the data about the date,
month and under other heads as indicated above is not
shown in the Call Data Record submitted to us.  As the
certificate issued under Section 65-B does not bear the
name and  designation of the person, who has signed the
certificate, it is difficult for us, at this stage, to know how
and why the complete Call Data Record is not submitted to
us.  In view of this, even though the formality of issuance of
certificate under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act is
completed, we are of the opinion that our order to submit
the complete Call Data Record and other documents with
the certificate under Section 65-B has not been complied
by  Vodafone  South  Limited.   Therefore,  we  find  it
necessary to issue the following directions:-
Summons  be  issued  to  Nodal  Officer,
Vodafone South Limited, to direct the officer, who is
responsible  for  the  operations  and  the
Management of the computer system required for
the purpose of providing mobile facility to secure
hard copies of the complete Call Data Record of
Mobile Phone No. 9564784782 for the period from
1st June,  2011  to  4th July,  2011,  along  with  the
record of Customer Agreement and to submit the
same to this Tribunal with certificate under Section
65-B, disclosing the name and designation of the
person  who  has  signed  the  said  certificate.  The
said record shall be submitted before this Tribunal
on 3rd March, 2015 before 11.00 A.M. by the officer
signing  the  certificate  under  Section  65-B
personally without fail.  
We also hereby direct Vodafone South Limited to
disclose the name and designation of the person, who had
issued  the  certificate  under  Section  65-B  on  10th
December, 2014, along with Call Data Record and also to
keep him present before this Tribunal on 3rd March, 2015 at
11.00 A.M. to explain how some of the data, particularly
the dates, First Call ID A, Last Call ID A, IMEI and IMSI,
are missing from the said record.”   
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 23 of 2922.In this behalf, we also note that Mr. Sabir Kumar Deb, official of
Vodafone, appeared as a witness, in his deposition before the AFT
had suitably and satisfactorily clarified all the aspects including the
following :
“Examination-in-Chief :
The  Call  Data  Record  of  the  mobile  phones  are
maintained in the centralised server located at Pune.  Call
records of the phones issued by all the 23 licensees under
Vodafone  Limited  are  preserved  and  maintained  in  the
centralised server.
The mobile number for which the date is extracted is
the ‘target numbers’ for the system. Identity number of hand
set from which that mobile number operates is recorded in
the column IMEI.  The same handset number will be shown
in that column when a call is made or is received by that
mobile handset.  However, if the handset is changed, the
identity of that handset is changed and therefore, number
may be same.
When mobile number is roaming outside the territory
of the service provider/licensee the Cell IDA and IMEI  will
not record the correct numbers because it may not capture
the correct number in the area outside the jurisdiction of the
licensee.  Therefore, at page No. 4 from 3rd entry dated
15.06.2011, the column for IMEI is blank.  From that entry
onwards till the end on 01.07.2011 the mobile number was
operating  outside  the  home  network  area.   In  the  last
column  the  area  in  which  the  mobile  was  roaming  the
operating is indicated.
Now, I am shown the record which I have s8ubmitted
to the Court as per Ex. T-2.  After perusing that record with
the record available with me, I say that due to oversight,
page no. 8 of the record showing the call from 30.06.2011 at
6:20:12 to the call on 01.07.2011 at 21:53:28 has not been
submitted  to  the  Court.   Now,  I  am  attaching  the  page
containing the said record under my signature and stamp of
Vodafone South Limited.  I state that this record is true and
generated as per the system.  (The said record is added to
the CDR Ex. T-2 as page No. 8).
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 24 of 29Now, the record and letter dated 10.12.2014 marked
Article T-1 (Now T-3) collectively is shown to me.  It contains
same  call  data  record  which  I  have  produced  today.
However, in the record data, first Cell IDA, last cell IDA, IMEI
and IMSE columns are blank.  Also, SMS centre column is
blank.  The  title  of  that  record  shows  that  the  record  of
mobile number 95664784782 from 1.6.2011 to 4.7.2011 and
report dated was 1.11.2011.  similar title is not printed on the
record which I have submitted today.  The columns noted
above  might  have  remained  blank  because  of  some
misalignment of columns while taking the prints of the call
record.  Now, said record Article T-1 is marked Exhibit T-3.
I maintain that the information in the Call Data Record could
not be selectively deleted before taking print.
Cross-Examination:
I  voluntarily  say  tat  sometimes,  due  to  failure  of
network link also some date may be missing at particular
moment, and is not printed.  Now, it is brought to my notice
that in Call Data Record at Exhibit T-2, column ‘call time’ is
listed earlier the Call Data Record at Ex. T-3 where it is 9th
column.  Now, on perusal of the two records, I see that in
Ex. T-2, SMS MT or SMS O are show but in Ex. T-3 they are
indicated as SMS INC and SMS OUT respectively.  Call
Data  Record  Exh.   T-3  shows  that  it  was  originated  on
November 1st, 2011 and Call Data Record at Ex. T-2 was
originated on 2nd March, 2015.
Now, it is brought to my notice that entry nos. 329 and
330 are not be seen in the Call Data Report Ex. T-2.  There
are similar other numbers  also which are missing from Exh.
T-2.  I say that wherever there were missed calls, they were
shown as NULL.  In 2011, such ‘missed c alls’ have been
deleted from the record and, therefore, they are not seen in
Call Data Record at Ex. T-2.  However, the SMS which were
shown as NULL and which could not materialise are still
maintained because the company was to earn revenue.”
23.We, thus, do not agree with the submission of the learned counsel for
the respondent that there were discrepancies in the CDR produced
by Vodafone before the AFT.  In fact, the witness from Vodafone was
able to clear all the doubts which were expressed by the respondent.
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 25 of 2924.In view of this factual position emerging on record, judgment in the
case of Shafhi Mohammad. V. State of Himachal Pradesh3  is of no
avail  to  the  respondent  as  it  is  not  applicable  to  the  facts  and
circumstances of the present case.  
25.At the end, insofar as appeal of the respondent is concerned, we
would like to comment that once the charges are proved in the court
martial conducted by the authorities and the AFT also has given its
imprimatur to the same by putting its stamp of approval, that too, after
recording the evidence, with detailed analyses thereof, it is not the
function of this Court to revisit the entire evidence to find out as to
whether the finding of the authorities below are correct or not.  No
doubt, the instant proceedings are in the form of appeal preferred
under Sections 30 and 31 of the Act and, therefore, the Court is
examining the matter as an appellate authority.  However, the scope
of such appeal is limited as can be seen from the language of these
provisions:
  “30. Appeal to Supreme Court.—(1) Subject to
the provisions of section 31, an appeal shall  lie to the
Supreme Court against the final decision or order of the
Tribunal (other than an order passed under section 19): 
Provided that such appeal is preferred within a period
of ninety days of the said decision or order:
Provided further that there shall be no appeal against
an interlocutory order of the Tribunal. 
3(2018) @ SCC 801
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 26 of 29(2) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court as of right
from any order or decision of the Tribunal in the exercise of
its jurisdiction to punish for contempt:
Provided that an appeal under this sub-section shall be
filed in the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date
of the order appealed against. 
(3)  Pending  any  appeal  under  sub-section  (2),  the
Supreme Court may order that—
(a)  the  execution  of  the  punishment  or  the  order
appealed against be suspended; or 
(b) if the appellant is in confinement, he be released on
bail: 
Provided that where an appellant satisfies the Tribunal
that he intends to prefer an appeal, the Tribunal may also
exercise any of the powers conferred under clause (a) or
clause (b), as the case may be.
31. Leave to appeal.—(1) An appeal to the Supreme Court
shall lie with the leave of the Tribunal; and such leave shall
not be granted unless it is certified by the Tribunal that a
point of law of general public importance is involved in the
decision, or it appears to the Supreme Court that the point
is one which ought to be considered by that Court.
(2) An application to the Tribunal for leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court shall be made within a period of thirty days
beginning with the date of the decision of the Tribunal and
an application to the Supreme Court for leave shall be
made within a period of thirty days beginning with the date
on  which  the  application  for  leave  is  refused  by  the
Tribunal.
(3)  An  appeal  shall  be  treated  as  pending  until  any
application for leave to appeal is disposed of and if leave
to appeal is granted, until the appeal is disposed of; and an
application for leave to appeal shall be treated as disposed
of at the expiration of the time within which it might have
been made, but it is not made within that time.”
26.A combined reading of the aforesaid provisions clearly brings out that
appeal to this Court has to be on a point of law on general public
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 27 of 29importance.
27.In any case, this Court has examined the records having regard to the
submissions  made  by  Dr.  Sharma  on  behalf  of  the  respondents.
However, no case is made out that the conclusion arrived at by the
Tribunal was utterly perverse which no reasonable person could have
arrived at.  We have not found any such infirmity at all.
28.Resultantly, we do not find any merit in the appeal preferred by the
Officer.
29.We now advert to the appeal preferred by the Union of India.   As
pointed out above, the limited scope of this appeal is to be on the
quantum  of  sentence  given  by  the  AFT.   After  setting  aside  the
sentence of dismissal from service, the Tribunal has substituted the
same by the sentence of loss  of seniority for 24 months.  Further,
while directing reinstatement in service, the Tribunal has also ordered
that the respondent herein shall not be entitled to pay and allowances
for the period from the date when he was dismissed from the service
till the date of reinstatement, if it is within three months from the date
of order of the Tribunal.
30.The respondent has not reinstated in service as this court had, vide
orders  dated  August  31,  2015,  stayed  the  operation  of  the  said
order/direction.   Thus,  the  respondent  is  still  out  of  service  and,
therefore, lost his salary from the date of the order of the Tribunal
Criminal Appeal No. 579 of 2016 a/w connected matter
Page 28 of 29which  was  passed  on  March  04,  2015.   The  respondent  was
dismissed from service vide orders dated January 26, 2013.  For all
these reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with the order of the
Tribunal on sentence inasmuch the effect is that not only seniority of
the respondent is forfeited by 24 months,  he is also deprived of his
salary for more than five years.  Such a  sentence, according to us,
would meet the ends of justice and in these circumstances discretion
exercised by the Tribunal does not need any interference.
31.As a consequence, both the appeals are dismissed.  The respondent
herein shall be  reinstated in service within 2 weeks from the date of
passing of this order and he shall not be entitled to any salary for the
intervening period, i.e., from the date of dismissal till the date of
reinstatement.
There shall be no orders as to costs.

ASEEM AGARWAL                         RESPONDENT(S)
O R D E R
1.Leave granted.
2.This  appeal  takes  exception  to  the
judgment and order dated 15.07.2019 passed by the
High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in C.M.(M)
No.1019  of  2019,  whereby  the  High  Court
entertained  the  writ  petition  filed  by  the
respondent herein, Assem Agarwal, under Article
227 of the Constitution of India challenging the
order dated 01.12.2018 passed by the Family Court,
Patiala House in H.M.A. No.33 of 2012 directing
the respondent to produce the subject documents.
3.The High Court by the impugned order not
only entertained the writ petition but stayed the
trial before the Family Court, which is pending
since 2011 (renumbered in 2012). 2
4.The necessity of producing the documents by
the  respondent  relates  back  to  Order  dated
28.01.2014 passed by the Family Court, which reads
thus:
“28/1/2014
Pr: Petitioner in person alongwith her
    father and Sh.N.K. Srivastava. 
SPA Ms. Reena Jain for the respondent
is also advocate for respondent.
Petitioner  wants  to  file  formal
response to affidavit as referred in order
dated 6/12/2013. On communication from the
respondent  along  with  the  attested
affidavit in original (copy already filed)
has been filed by the Ld. SPA.
Adjourned for filing of response by
the  petitioner  and  for  production  of
remaining original documents, if any and
admission/denial of documents on 12/3/2014.
Let the attested copy of divorce petition
and  the  judgment  and  decree  passed  by
Family Court at Auckland in New Zealand  be
filed by the respondent and advance copy be
given to the other side.”
(emphasis supplied in italics)
5.It is not in dispute that this order has
been allowed to become final by the respondent. As
a matter of fact, the respondent partly complied
with  this  direction  by  only  producing  decree
passed by the Family Court at Aukland in New
Zealand and not the judgment and divorce petition.
Resultantly, the appellant moved the Family Court
for  issuing  necessary  directions  to  the
respondent, which application was allowed by the3
Family Court vide order dated 01.12.2018.
6.Indisputably, directions were issued to
the respondent to produce the stated documents
which,  however,  remained  uncomplied  till
19.03.2019. On 29.03.2019 the respondent through
counsel gave undertaking to the Family Court that
he would file the documents on the next date of
hearing. When the matter was again taken up on
03.04.2019, the Family Court was informed that the
documents are in transit. Even on 21.05.2019, the
respondent gave impression to the Family court
that the documents were still in transit.
7.Instead  of  complying  with  the
undertaking, the respondent chose to file writ
petition to challenge the order dated 01.12.2018,
which, as aforesaid, has been entertained by the
High Court being oblivious of the fact that the
respondent had given a solemn undertaking to the
Family Court to produce the documents, through his
counsel.
8.Counsel for the appellant contends that
the undertaking to the Family Court was given not
only by the counsel appearing for the respondent4
but also by his Power of Attorney. The respondent,
however,  disputes  the  correctness  of  this
submission. We are not required to go into this
controversy.
9.Suffice it to note that the High Court
was impressed by the specious argument of the
respondent that the documents insisted upon are
not relevant to decide the controversy in issue.
On that basis, the High Court proceeded to stay
the trial. 
10.In our opinion, the respondent having
given undertaking to the Family Court through
counsel and/or Power of Attorney, as the case may
be, was obliged to comply with the same unless
absolved therefrom by the Family Court.  The
question of entertaining writ petition despite
such undertaking to the Family Court cannot be
countenanced.  If the respondent is not relieved
of the undertaking by the Family Court, he must
take the consequences of the order passed by the
Family Court directing production of the said
documents. We are of the opinion that if this
position was brought to the notice of the High
Court on 15.07.2019, perhaps the writ petition5
would not have been entertained by the High Court.
11.The counsel for the respondent submits
that this argument was advanced before the High
Court. If so, the High Court ought to have taken
note of the same in the impugned judgment, which
is conspicuously absent. Even for that reason, the
impugned judgment cannot be sustained.
12.In view of the above, we set aside the
impugned order as also dismiss the writ petition
filed by the respondent before the High Court
being C.M.(M) No.1019/2019, but give liberty to
the respondent to approach the Family Court by way
of appropriate application including to absolve
the respondent from the undertaking given on his
behalf  or  in  the  alternative  to  produce  the
documents referred to in the order of the Family
Court dated 01.12.2018, as may be advised. If such
application is filed, the same be considered by
the Family Court on its own merits in accordance
with  law.  If  the  respondent  needs  some  more
reasonable  time  to  produce  the  document  in
question even that application can be made before
the  Family  Court  which  be  considered
appropriately.6
13.We further make it clear that it will be
open to the Family Court to proceed with the
proceedings pending before it on the basis of
record/evidence to be produced by the parties.
14.Needless to observe that production of
the stated documents by the respondent will not
come in his way to contend that the same are not
relevant for deciding the matter pending before
the  Family  Court.  That  contention  can  be
considered on its own merits by the Family Court
in accordance with law.
15.The appeal and pending applications are
accordingly disposed of in the above terms.

UNION OF INDIA & ORS              APPELLANTS
VERSUS
LT COLONEL DHARAMVIR SINGH              RESPONDENT
J U D G M E N T
Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J
1Leave granted.
2The  respondent  is  a  Lieutenant  Colonel  in  the  Indian  Army.  On  20
September 2016,  as an officer of the Intelligence Corps, he was posted to 3
Corps Intelligence and Surveillance Unit1. On 30 June 2018 he was posted from
3  CISU  as  an  Officer  Commanding   2  Detachment in  Imphal to  Nanded  in
1[“3 CISU”] 
1Maharashtra.  His successor, Lt Colonel RP Nanda addressed two letters on 30
June 2018 and 2 July 2018 to his Commanding Officer implicating breaches of
discipline,  violations of the Arms Act 1959,  and security and administrative
lapses by the respondent. According to the petitioners,  on being directed to
report  to  Unit  Headquarters  by  his  Commanding  Officer  at  3  CISU,  the
respondent moved to Dimapur. On 4 July 2018 a Habeas Corpus Petition2 was
instituted before the High Court of Manipur by his spouse. On 5 July 2018, the
High Court directed the authorities to ensure the presence of the respondent. In
compliance with the order of the High Court, the respondent appeared in Court,
when an order was passed, recording that:
“Prima facie as on today, Lt.Col.Dharamvir Singh is not in
illegal custody or in the custody of any of the Officers of the
respondent/department.”
  
On 5 October 2018 an order was issued attaching the respondent to Hq 56
Artillery  Brigade  Unit  for  initiating  disciplinary  action  under Army  Instructions
30/86. He instituted a Writ Petition before the High Court of Manipur under Article
226 of the Constitution, seeking to challenge the validity of the attachment order
dated 5 October 2018 issued by the Additional Directorate General, Discipline
and  Vigilance,  Adjutant  General’s  Branch,  Integrated  HQ  of  the  Ministry  of
Defence (Army), New Delhi. The order of attachment reads thus :
“Attachment Order :
1.Ref. HQ Eastern Comd Letter No.201940/157/A1(Dv-2) dated
29 Sep 2018 (copy enclosed for ready reference).
2.IC 57196X Lt. Col. Dharamvir Singh ex OC No.2 FID, 3 CISU
presently  posted  to  52  Maharashtra  NCC  Bn,  Nanded,
Maharashtra is hereby attached to 56 Arty Bde/56 Inf Div/3
Corps under the provisions of AI 30/86.
2 Habeas Corpus Petition No 11 of 2018
23.The offr be directed to report to 56 Arty Bde/56 Inf Div/3
Corps  forthwith  and  compliance  report  to  this  effect  may
please be fwd to this HQ.”
3The  order  of  attachment  was  followed  by  a  communication  dated  2
November  2018  of  HQ  DG  NCC,  Ministry  of  Defence  and  a  similar
communication of the NCC Directorate, Maharashtra requiring the respondent to
report to 56 Arty Bde/56 Inf Div/3 Corps.
4The Writ Petition which was instituted before the High Court of Manipur on
5 November 2018, specifically called into question the legality of these orders.
The prayers in the petition are extracted below:
“ii. Issue a Writ in the nature of Certiorari for quashing (i) the
letter dated 5.10.2018 issued by the Additional Directorate
General, Discipline and Vigilance, Adjutant General’s Branch,
Integrated HQ of MOD (Army), New Delhi 110011, (ii) letter
dated  2.11.2018  issued  by  the  HQ  DGNCC,  Ministry  of
Defence, West Block-IV, RK Puram, New Delhi – 110066 and
(iii)  letter  dated  2.11.2018  issued  by  NCC  Directorate,
Maharashtra  AFI  Building,  Bombay  Hospital  Lane,  Dhobi
Talao, Mumbai – 400020.”
5A learned Single Judge of the High Court entertained the Writ Petition on 5
November 2018. A submission was made before the High Court that an order of
attachment, as prescribed under Army Instruction No.30 of 1986, can be ordered
only when a disciplinary action has been contemplated and when the order of
attachment was issued on 5 October 2018, a tentative charge-sheet had not
been furnished to the officer.
36An objection was raised to the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain the
Writ Petition, since the respondent at the time of the initiation of the action of
attachment was based at Nanded in Maharashtra and the orders were issued by
the Headquarters at New Delhi. Yet the High Court proceeded to entertain the
Writ Petition on the submission which  was  urged before it that the order of
attachment had been issued for the purpose of holding an enquiry in respect of
incidents which had taken place at Imphal when the respondent was posted
there. The hearing was adjourned to 23 November 2018 to consider the objection
to the maintainability of the Writ Petition. Until then the orders impugned were
stayed. 
7On 24 January 2019, the High Court confirmed the earlier ad-interim order.
While doing so, the High Court adverted to a file which was placed in a sealed
cover before it. The High Court noted that the order of attachment was ordered
pursuant  to  a  communication  dated  29  September  2018  of  the  Lieutenant
General and General Officer Commanding (GOC) enclosing a report dated 2 July
2018 of Lt Col R P Nanda, who was transferred in place of the respondent. It is at
that stage that the High Court also noted that the order of attachment appeared
to have been issued after the respondent had filed an affidavit on 20 July 2018 in
Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 11 of 2018. The High Court observed that the subject of
the said Criminal Writ Petition pertained to an allegation against certain members
of the 3 Corps Intelligence Unit going back to 18 August 2011. The High Court
took note of the fact that an SIT has been constituted by the Guwahati High Court
in Writ Petition (C) 2481 of 2014. On the basis that nothing appears to have been
4done by any authority in respect of the alleged incidents which took place on 18
August 2011, the High Court proceeded to confirm its interim order dated 5
November 2018.
8Notice was issued by this Court in the present proceedings on 8 February
2019.  In  the  meantime,  further  proceedings  before  the  High  Court  and  the
impugned orders dated 5 November 2018 and 24 January 2019 were stayed.
9On service of notice, on the request of Mr Colin Gonsalves, learned Senior
Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, the Special Leave Petition was
directed to be listed on 15 February 2019 since it was apprehended that in view
of the interim order of this Court the disciplinary jurisdiction would be invoked. 
10We have accordingly heard Mr Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor
General of India (ASG) with Mr R Balasubramanian, learned Counsel and Mr
Colin  Gonsalves,  learned  Senior  Counsel  with  Mr  Shreeji  Bhavsar,  learned
Counsel. 
11The submission which has been urged on behalf of the appellants by Mr
Aman Lekhi, learned ASG is that in entertaining the Writ Petition, the High Court
has encroached upon an area which falls within the discipline of the Army. The
respondent, it has been submitted, is an officer governed by the Army Act 1950.
The provisions of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act 2007 govern all matters relating
to  the  conditions  of  service  including  discipline  and  other  issues.  In  the
circumstances, it was urged that there was no justification for the Manipur High
5Court to entertain the Writ Petition. At the relevant time, before the order of
attachment  was  issued,  the  respondent  had  been  posted  to  Nanded  in
Maharashtra. The ASG submitted that the exercise of the jurisdiction by the High
Court virtually pre-empts the disciplinary jurisdiction of the competent authority in
respect of an officer governed by the Army Act 1950.    
12Mr  Colin  Gonsalves,  learned  Senior  Counsel  submitted  that  the
respondent had addressed a communication on 9 September 2016 to the GOC-
in-C, Eastern Command making allegations in regard to certain incidents which
took place in 2011. Learned Counsel urged that the respondent was pressurized
by the then CO, 3 CISU to withdraw his letter dated 9 September 2016 which he
did on 20 September 2017. A complaint, he submits, was addressed to the Chief
of the Army Staff on 1 July 2018. Mr Gonsalves submitted that the learned Single
Judge of the High Court was justified in entertaining the Writ Petition since the
respondent, in an affidavit filed in Writ Petition No. 11 of 2018, has made serious
allegations in regard to the conduct of the members of 3 Corps Intelligence and
Surveillance Unit in regard to the death of three individuals from Manipur in 2010-
2011.  In  the  alternative,  Mr  Gonsalves,  submitted  that  attachment  of  the
respondent may be altered to another unit so as to ensure fair dealing.
13In our view, the High Court was manifestly in error in entering upon an area
which relates to the exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Army under the
Army Act 1950. The admitted position is that the respondent was posted at
Nanded in Maharashtra. The learned Single Judge had no reasonable basis to
6exercise jurisdiction. Mr Gonsalves has adverted to the fact that the spouse of the
respondent initiated a petition for habeas corpus initially before the High Court of
Manipur. Significantly, the challenge in the Writ Petition which was instituted by
the  respondent  before  the  High  Court  related  exclusively  to  the  order  of
attachment dated 5 October 2018, which was followed by two communications
dated 2 November 2018 requiring him to proceed to the place of attachment. An
officer  subject  to  the  discipline  of  the  Army  Act  1950  must  abide  by  the
regulations,  if  the  disciplinary  jurisdiction  is  sought  to  be  invoked.  It  was
manifestly inappropriate for the High Court to take upon itself the task of pre-
empting the exercise of that jurisdiction and taking over the essential function of
determining  whether  or  not  recourse  to  the  disciplinary  jurisdiction  was
warranted. 
14Mr Colin Gonsalves has placed reliance on a communication which was
issued  by  the  respondent  to  Lt  Gen  Praveen  Bakshi,  GOC-in-C,  Eastern
Command on 9 September 2016. There was no material before the High Court to
link the initiation of the disciplinary enquiry to the grievance which was made by
the respondent as far back as on 20 September 2016.
15The assumption of jurisdiction by the High Court in a Writ Petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution was misconceived. We are also of the view that
having regard to the definition of the expression “service matters” in Section 3(o)
of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act 2007 and the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces
7Tribunal  under  Section  14,  such  a  Writ  Petition  ought  not  to  have  been
entertained by the High Court. The learned Single Judge should have exercised
caution and ought to have been circumspect before he proceeded to stay an
order  of  attachment.  Such  pre-emptive  judicial  strikes  are  unwarranted.  The
course of action followed by the Single Judge has serious repercussions for the
maintenance  of  discipline  in  the  Army.  Discipline  is  the  essence  of  the
organisation and structure of an Armed Force. Before concluding, we make it
clear that we have expressed no opinion on the merits of the allegations, in the
exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction which shall be dealt with in accordance
with law. There is no merit in the alternate submission. This Court cannot take
over the function of determining which unit the respondent should be assigned,
pending the disciplinary proceedings.  
   
16We allow the appeal and set aside the impugned orders of the High Court
dated 5 November 2018 and 24 January 2019. In consequence, Writ Petition
(Civil) 1031 of 2018 filed by the respondent before the High Court of Manipur
shall stand dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending applications
are accordingly disposed of.

DISABLED RIGHTS GROUP & ANR. .....PETITIONER(S)
VERSUS
UNION OF INDIA & ORS. .....RESPONDENT(S)
W I T H
WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 997 OF 2013
J U D G M E N T
A.K. SIKRI, J.
Three issues are raised in this petition which is filed in public
interest, for the benefit of persons suffering from ‘disabililty’ as per the
definition contained in the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities,
Protection of Rights and Full Participation Act) 1995 (hereinafter referred
to as the ‘Disabilities Act, 1995’) which now stands repealed and is
replaced by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘Disabilities Act, 2016’).   The first issue related to the2
non-implementation of 3% reservation of seats in educational institutions
as provided in Section 39 of the Disabilities Act, 1995 and Section 32 of
the Disabilities Act, 2016.  Second equally important issue raised in this
petition, which is intimately connected with the first issue, is to provide
proper access to orthopaedic disabled persons so that they are able to
freely move in the educational institution and access the facilities.  Third
issue pertains to pedagogy i.e. making adequate provisions and facilities
of teaching for disabled persons, depending upon the nature of their
disability, to enable them to undertake their studies effectively.  
We may state at the outset that though the petition as originally
filed had confined these issues only to law colleges.  In view of the fact
that  these  issues  are  of  seminal  importance,  this  Court  decided  to
extend the coverage by encompassing all educational institutions. 
 
2)As can be discerned from the number assigned to this writ petition, it
was filed in the year 2006 and, thus, is pending for eleven years.  The
reason was that this Court has been calling for the status report(s) from
the respondents/Government Authorities from time to time about the
implementation of the Disabilities Act insofar as provisions relating to the
aforesaid aspects are concerned.  Since the matter was ripe for passing
final orders and directions, we deemed it proper to hear the counsel for
the parties at length so that the writ petition is disposed of by giving final
directions in this behalf.  3
(I)Re: 3% Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions
3)Section 39 of the Disabilities Act, 1995 reads as under:
“Section 39 : All Government educational institutions and
other  educational  institutions  receiving  aid  from  the
Government, shall reserve not less than three per cent
seat for persons with disabilities.”
4)As per this provision, all Government educational institutions as well as
other  educational  institutions  which  are  receiving  aid  from  the
Government are supposed to reserve seats for the benefit of persons
with disabilities, which reservation shall not be less than 3%.  Thus, 3%
of the seats is the minimum reservation and it can be even more than
3%.  This provision had come up for discussion before this Court in All
Kerala  Parents  Association  of  the  Hearing  Impaired  v.  State  of
Kerala1 and the Court issued following directions therein:
“We...hold that Section 39 deals with the reservation of
seats  for  persons  with  disabilities  in  government
educational institutions as well as educational institutions
receiving  aid  from  the  government,  and  necessarily
therefore the provison thereof must be complied with.”
5)Disabilities  Act,  2016  makes  more  exhaustive  provisions  insofar  as
providing  of  educational  facilities  to  the  persons  with  disabilities  is
concerned.  Section 31 confers right to free education upon children with
benchmark disabilities who are between the age of 6 to 18 years.  This
provision is made notwithstanding anything contained in the Rights of
1 2002 (7) Scale 1984
Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.  Section 32
makes  provisions  for  reservation  in  higher  educational  institutions.
Section  34  provides  for  reservation  in  employment.   Since,  we  are
concerned with reservation of seats in educational institutions and as
Section 32 directly deals with the same, we reproduce that provision
hereunder:
“32. (1) All Government institutions of higher education
and other higher education institutions receiving aid from
the Government shall reserve not less than five per cent.
seats for persons with benchmark disabilities. 
(2) The persons with benchmark disabilities shall be given
an upper age relaxation of five years for admission in
institutions of higher education.”
6)The educational institutions covered by this provision are not only the
Government  institutions  of  higher  education  but  all  those  higher
education  institutions  which  are  receiving  aid  from  the  Government.
Other pertinent aspect is that the extent of reservation is increased from
3% under Disabilities Act, 1995 to 5% under this Disabilities Act, 2016.
One more important improvement made in Disabilities Act, 2016 over
the earlier Act is that such provisions are made for ‘persons with bench
mark disabilities’.  This expression is defined in Section 2(r) which reads
as under:
“Section 2(r) “person with benchmark disability” means a
person with not less than forty per cent. of a specified
disability where specified disability has not been defined
in measurable terms and includes a person with disability
where specified disability has been defined in measurable5
terms, as certified by the certifying authority.”
7)It, thus, hardly needs to be emphasised that such educational institutions
are  bound  to  reserve  seats  from  persons  suffering  from  disability.
Notwithstanding  the  same,  grievance  of  the  petitioner  is  that  the
educational institutions have not been adhering thereto.
8)No doubt, some progress is made in this behalf after the filing of this
present petition and monitoring of the case by this Court, there is a need
for complying with this provision to full extent.  Accordingly, we direct
that all those institutions which are covered by the obligations provided
under Section 32 of the Disabilities Act, 2016 shall comply with the
provisions  of  Section  32  while  making  admission  of  students  in
educational courses of higher education each year.  To this end, they
shall submit list of the number of disabled persons admitted in each
course  every  year  to  the  Chief  Commissioner  and/or  the  State
Commissioner (as the case may be).  It will also be the duty of the Chief
Commissioner  as  well  as  the  State  Commissioner  to  enquire  as  to
whether  these  educational  institutions  have  fulfilled  the  aforesaid
obligation.   Needless  to  mention,  appropriate  consequential  action
against those educational institutions, as provided under Section 89 of
the Disabilities Act, 2016 as well as other provisions, shall be initiated
against defaulting institutions.  6
(II) & (III)Re: Provision for accessibility as well as facilities
9)In  another  judgment  pronounced  today  itself  in  the  case  of  Rajive
Raturi v. Union of India & Ors.  (Civil Appeal No. 243 of 2005 with Anr.),
this very Bench has given detailed directions for making appropriate
provisions for accessibility of handicapped persons, though the scope of
that petition was confined to persons suffering from visual impairment.
However, various aspects discussed and directions given for making
suitable provisions in this behalf would benefit persons suffering from
other disabilities as well.  Therefore, the position of law discussed in
detail in the said judgment and the directions issued therein need not be
repeated  for  the  sake  of  brevity.  We  would,  however, recapitulate
following provisions contained in Disabilities Act, 2016:
Section 2(i) - ‘establishment includes a Government establishment and
private establishment”
Section  2(k)  -  ‘Government  establishment’  means  a  corporation
established by or under a Central Act or State Act or an authority or a
body  owned  or  controlled  or  aided  by  the  Government  or  a  local
authority or  a  Government  company as  defined  in  section  2  of  the
Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) and includes a Department of the
Government.7
Section  2(v)  -  “private  establishment”  means  a  company,  firm,
cooperative  or  other  society,  associations,  trust,  agency,  institution,
organisation,  union,  factory  or  such  other  establishment  as  the
appropriate  Government  may,  by  notification,  specify;  (w)  “public
building” means a Government or private building, used or accessed by
the public at large, including a building used for educational or vocational
purposes,  workplace,  commercial  activities,  public  utilities,  religious,
cultural, leisure or recreational activities, medical or health services, law
enforcement agencies, reformatories or judicial foras, railway stations or
platforms, roadways bus stands or terminus, airports or waterways;
Section 2(w) - “public building” means a Government or private building,
used or accessed by the public at large, including a building used for
educational  or  vocational purposes, workplace,  commercial  activities,
public  utilities,  religious,  cultural,  leisure  or  recreational  activities,
medical or health services, law enforcement agencies, reformatories or
judicial  foras,  railway stations  or  platforms,  roadways  bus  stands  or
terminus, airports or waterways;
Section  2(zd)  -  “transportation  systems”  includes  road  transport,  rail
transport, air transport, water transport, para transit systems for the last
mile connectivity, road and street infrastructure, etc; 8
Section  2(ze)  -  “universal  design”  means  the  design  of  products,
environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people to
the  greatest  extent  possible,  without  the  need  for  adaptation  or
specialised  design  and  shall  apply  to  assistive  devices  including
advanced technologies for particular group of persons with disabilities.
Section 2(b) - “appropriate Government” means,— 
(i) in relation to the Central Government or any establishment wholly or
substantially  financed  by  that  Government,  or  a  Cantonment  Board
constituted under the Cantonments Act, 2006 (41 of 2006), the Central
Government; 
(ii) in relation to a State Government or any establishment, wholly or
substantially financed by that Government, or any local authority, other
than a Cantonment Board, the State Government.
Section  16  mandates  the  appropriate  Government  and  the  local
authorities  to  endeavour  that  all  educational  institutions  funded  or
recognised  by them  provide  inclusive  education  to  the  children  with
disabilities  and  towards  that  end  shall  make  buildings,  campus  and
various facilities accessible.
Section  25(1)(b)  mandates  the  appropriate  Government  and  local
authority to take necessary measures for the persons with disabilities to9
provide  barrier-free  access  in  all  parts  of  Government  and  private
hospitals and other health care institutions and centres.
Section 40 mandates the Central Government to frame Rules and laying
down  the  standards  of  accessibility  for  physical  environment,
transportation system, information & communication system and other
facilities & services to be provided to the public in urban and rural areas.
Rule 15 deals with accessibility standards for public buildings, passenger
bus  transport  and  information  and  communication  technology.   As
regards public buildings, the accessibility standards prescribed under the
Harmonised  Guidelines  and  Space  Standards  for  barrier-free  built
environment for persons with disabilities and elderly persons issued by
Ministry of Urban Development have been adopted.  This implies that all
the public buildings are now required to conform to these standards.
10)It hardly needs to be emphasised that Disabilities Act is premised
on the fundamental idea that society creates the barriers and oppressive
structures  which  impede  the  capacities  of  person  with  disabilities.
Capability theorists like Martha Nussbaum are of the opinion that there
cannot  be  a  different  set  of  capacities  or  a  different  threshold  of
capabilities for persons with disabilities. This raises the critical issue of
creating a level playing field whereby all citizens to have equality of fair
opportunities to enable them to realise their full potential and experience10
well-being.  To ensure the level playing field, it is not only essential to
give necessary education to the persons suffering from the disability, it is
also imperative to see that such education is imparted to them in a
fruitful manner.  That can be achieved only if there is proper accessibility
to the buildings where the educational institution is housed as well as to
other  facilities  in  the  said  building,  namely,  class  rooms,  library,
bathrooms etc.  Without that physically handicapped persons would not
be able to avail and utilise the educational opportunity in full measure.
11)Various theories on different models of disability have emerged,
namely, the Social Model of Disability, the Medical Model of Disability,
the  Rights  Base  Model  of  Disability,  the  Model  of  Ethical  and
Philosophical Status, the Economic Model of Disability etc2.  It is not
necessary to delve into these different models of disabilities.  However,
for the purpose of the present case, some comments are required on the
Social  Model  of  Disability.   The  Social  Model  of  Disability  locates
disability as being socially constructed through the creation of artificial
attitudinal,  organisational  and  environmental  barriers.  Impairment  is
regarded as being a normal part of the human condition, with everyone
experiencing impairment differently and having different access needs.
Life is accepted as including negative experiences, and impairment may
2 For detailed discussion, see Theoretizing the Models of  Disability Philosophical
Social and Medical Concepts-An Empirical Research based on existing Literature by Shanimon. S.
and Rateesh. K. Nair11
be - but is not necessarily - one of them. Disabled people are defined as
being  people  who  experience  the  unnecessary  barriers  created  by
society within their daily life. Social Model of disability has gained ground
in the international debate. This views disability as a social construct and
emphasizes society's shortcomings, stigmatization and discrimination in
its reaction to persons with disability. It distinguishes between functional
impairments (disability) both of a physical and psychological nature, and
the  loss  of  equal  participation  in  social  processes  that  only  arises
through  interaction  with  the  social  setting  (handicap).  These
developments have contributed to a new (WHO) model, which bears in
mind  social  as  well  as  functional  and  individual  factors  in  its
classification of health and health-related areas.  Keeping in view the
above,  proper  facilities  are  need  to  be  provided  to  differently-abled
persons while having higher education.
12)Insofar as the rights base approach is concerned, that has been
narrated in detail in Rajive Raturi’s judgment.  We may add that a basic
underline assumption, which is well recognised, is that everyone can
learn; there is no such person as one who is ineducable; and that,
accordingly,  all  disabled  persons  (from  whatever  disability  they  are
suffering)  have  right  to  get  not  only  minimum  education  but  higher
education as well.  Not making adequate provisions to facilitate proper
education to such persons, therefore, would amount to discrimination.12
Such requirement is to ensure that even a student with disability, after
proper education, will be able to lead an independent, economically self
sufficient,  productive  and  fully  participatory  life.   This  rights-based
approach is an inclusive approach which class for the participation of all
groups  of  the  population,  including  disadvantaged  persons,  in  the
development  process.   Inclusive  development  builds  on  the  idea  of
‘Society for All’ in which all people are equally free to develop their
potential, contribute their skills and abilities for the common good and to
take  up  their  entitlements  to  social  services.   It  emphasises
strengthening the rights of the people with disabilities, and foster their
participation in all aspects of life.   A disability is only actually a disability
when it prevents someone from doing what they want or need to do.   A
lawyer can be just as effective in a wheelchair, as long as she has
access to the courtroom and the legal library, as well as to whatever
other places and material or equipment that are necessary for her to do
her job well.  A person who can’t hear can be a master carpenter or the
head  of  a  chemistry  lab,  if  he  can  communicate  with  clients  and
assistants.  A person with mental illness can nonetheless be a brilliant
scholar or theorist3.  The aforesaid discussion amply justifies right of
access to students with disabilities to educational institutions in which
they are admitted.  
3 We have a celebrated examples of John Nash, a noted mathematician who earned
laurels by getting noble prize and Stephen Hawkins.13
13)It would be pertinent to mention at this stage that in the guidelines
for  development  grant  to  colleges  framed  by  the  University  Grants
Commission  (UGC),  the  UGC  has  specifically  made  provisions
concerning ‘schemes for persons with disabilities’.  There is a specific
scheme in respect of Higher Education for Persons with Special Needs
(HEPSN).  This HEPSN scheme has three components, namely,
(i)Establishment of Enabling Units for differently-abled persons.  The
function  of  this  unit  as  enumerated  therein  includes  creating
awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other
general issues concerning their learning.  This special unit is to be
guaranteed by a faculty member to be nominated by the Head of
the Institution.  
(ii)Component  2  of  the  scheme  deals  with  providing  access  to
differently-abled persons.  For this purpose, UGC agreed to make
a one-time grant of up to Rs.5 lakhs per college during the Plan
period.  To enable these institutions to make special arrangements
in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning
and  to  ensure  that  all  existing  structures  as  well  as  future
construction projects in their campuses are made disabled friendly.
(iii)Third  component  deals  with  providing  special  equipment  to14
augment  educational  services  for  differently-abled  persons.   It
recognises that differently-abled persons require special aids and
appliances  for  their  daily  functioning  and  that  the  higher
educational institutes may need special learning and assessment
devices in this behalf.  In addition, visually challenged students
need Readers.  Thus, colleges are encourage to procure such
devices  such  as  computers  with  screen  reading  software,
low-vision aids, scanners, mobility devices etc.  
14)The  petitioner  had  filed  a  compilation  on  February  22,  2016
containing suggestions, in the form of Guidelines, insofar as making
adequate infrastructure for providing proper access and also teaching
facilities (Pedagogy) for differently-abled persons are concerned:
(I)INFRASTRUCTURE

such as career counsellors, student counsellors, psychologists and any
other person attached to the university/college who provides services of19
any  type  to  the  students.  Special  admissions  window  for  disabled
students.  Sensitivity  training  on  disability  to  administrative  and
pedagogic staff.
(i)Sports, Culture, Recreation and Leisure Facilities
Universities/colleges to ensure that cultural/recreational programs
take into account need of students with disabilities to provide for their full
participation  in  such  programs.   Some  specific  examples  in  sports:
running  courses/tracks  to  be  straight  where  visually  impaired  and
orthopaedic impaired students are participating.  Special sporting events
to be conducted such as cricket for visually impaired and special events
according to para-olympic norms for orthopaedic impaired.  International
norms to be modified where necessary to suit the needs of the disabled
students.  Trainers to be sensitized towards disability and inclusion and
respective societies/associations to ensure that the information about
events/contests reaches the disabled students also.  Similarly, cultural
activities  with  adequate  modifications  to  be  made  available.   For
example, disabled students to be enabled to take part in theatre, literary,
dance and music activities with the help of assistants.  Hearing impaired
students  to  be  provided  with  an  interpreter  for  sports  and  cultural
activities of various types.
15)Based on the aforesaid suggestions, the petitioner made written20
submissions on February 22, 2016, seeking following directions:
“(a)  For an order directing the UGC to carry out an
inspection of the 3% reservation record of respondent
Nos. 11, 12 and 13 to ensure that 3% reservation for
persons with disabilities are complied with, including the
backlog.
(b)   For  an  order  directing  the  UGC  to  inspect  all
institutions  of  higher  education  to  ensure  that  these
institutions are made disabled friendly and make a report
to  the  Central  Executive  Committee  and  the  State
Executive Committees who will, in turn, ensure that the
institutions are made disabled friendly.
(c)   For  an  order  directing  the  UGC  to  consider  the
“Guidelines for Accessibility for Students with Disabilities
in  Universities/Colleges”  submitted  by  the  petitioner
pursuant to the order of this Court dated December 09,
2010 and after making such changes as deemed fit, to
issue  directions  to  all  institutions  of  higher  education,
including law colleges, for compliance within a specified
period.”
16)After coming into force the Disabilities Act, 2016, further directions
are sought in tune with the provisions contained in the said Act, in the
following manner:
“(d)   For  an  order  directing  the  Central  Government
under Section 40 of the Disabilities Act, 2016 to frame
the rules for persons with disabilities laying down the
standards of accessibility for colleges, universities and
other  higher  educational  institutions,  including
pedagogical  measures  such  as  reasonable
accommodation, modifications and aids and appliances
for lectures,  curricula, teaching  materials,  laboratories,
libraries,  examinations,  classrooms  and  hostels  etc.
within six months from today; and for a direction to the
appropriate  Governments  to  implement  the  said  rules
within two years from the notification of the said Rules in
accordance with Section 46.
(e)  For an order directing the Central Government to
take into consideration the Guidelines for Accessibility for21
Students  with  Disabilities  in  Universities/Colleges,  as
submitted  by  the  petitioner,  in  accordance  with  this
Court’s order dated January 20, 2011, while framing the
Rules under Section 40 of the Act.
(f)  For an order directing the Central Government to
create an audit template in conformity with the Rules for
accessibility in higher educational institutions referred to
in  (m)  above,  and  for  a  direction  to  the  appropriate
Governments  (Central  and  State  Governments,  UGC,
BCI)  to  conduct  an  audit  of  all  higher  educational
institutions within six months from today and to put all the
audit reports on a website.
(g)  For an order directing the UGC, the Central and the
State  Governments  to  invite  applications  from  higher
educational  institutions  for  funding  under  the  various
schemes  for  accessibility  and  to  release  funds  in
accordance thereof to facilitate accessibility measures in
the educational institutions.
(h)   For  an  order  directing  all  higher  educational
institutions  to  make  their  institutions  accessible  in
accordance with the Act and the Rules within two years
of  the  notification  of  the  rules;  and  for  mandatory
formation  in  each  institution  of  the  Enabling  Unit  for
disabled  students  as  per  UGC  scheme  ‘HEPSN’  to
ensure monitoring and implementation of the standards
and guidelines contained in the Rules.
(i)  For an order directing the Central and State Advisory
Boards  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  Act  and
Rules and the orders of this Court to ensure compliance.”
17)There cannot be any dispute that the suggestions given by the
petitioner, which are reproduced above, appear to be reasonable and
are worthy of implementation.  However, at the same time, it would be
appropriate to consider the feasibility thereof particularly with regard to
the manner in which these can be implemented.  This task can be
undertaken by the UGC.  Likewise, the directions which are sought by
the petitioners are in consonance with the provisions contained in the22
Disabilities Act, 2016.  In these circumstances, we dispose of these writ
petitions with the following directions:
(i)While  dealing  with  the  issue  of  reservation  of  seats  in  the
educational  institutions,  we  have  already  given  directions  in  para  8
above that the provisions of Section 32 of the Disabilities Act, 2016 shall
be complied with by all concerned educational institutions.  In addition to
the  directions  mentioned  therein,  we  also  direct  that  insofar  as  law
colleges are concerned, intimation in this behalf shall be sent by those
institutions to the Bar Council of India (BCI) as well.  Other educational
institutions will notify the compliance, each year, to the UGC.  It will be
within the discretion of the BCI and/or UGC to carry out inspections of
such educational institutions to verify as to whether the provisions are
complied with or not.
(ii)Insofar  as  suggestions  given  by  the  petitioner  in  the  form  of
“Guidelines  for  Accessibility  for  Students  with  Disabilities  in
Universities/Colleges”  are  concerned,  the  UGC  shall  consider  the
feasibility thereof by constituting a Committee in this behalf.  In this
Committee, the UGC would be free to include persons from amongst
Central Advisory Board, State Advisory Boards, Chief Commissioner of
State  Commissioners  appointed  under  the  Disabilities  Act.   This
Committee shall undertake a detailed study for making provisions in23
respect of accessibility as well as pedagogy and would also suggest the
modalities  for  implementing  those  suggestions,  their  funding  and
monitoring, etc.  The Committee shall also lay down the time limits within
which such suggestions could be implemented.  The Expert Committee
may also consider feasibility of constituting an in-house body in each
educational  institution  (of  teachers,  staff,  students  and  parents)  for
taking care of day to day needs of differently abled persons as well as
for implementation of the Schemes that would be devised by the Expert
Committee.  This exercise shall be completed by June 30, 2018.
(iii)Report in this behalf, as well as the Action Taken Report, shall be
submitted to this Court in July, 2018.  On receipt of the report, the matter
shall be placed before the Court.

 Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.K. Sikri pronounced the judgment of the
Bench  comprising  His  Lordship  and  Hon'ble  Mr.  Justice  Ashok
Bhushan. 
The  writ  petitions  are  disposed  of  with  the  following
directions:25
(i)While dealing with the issue of reservation of seats in
the educational institutions, we have already given directions
in para 8 above that the provisions of Section 32 of the
Disabilities Act, 2016 shall be complied with by all concerned
educational institutions.  In addition to the directions
mentioned therein, we also direct that insofar as law colleges
are concerned, intimation in this behalf shall be sent by
those institutions to the Bar Council of India (BCI) as well.
Other educational institutions will notify the compliance,
each year, to the UGC.  It will be within the discretion of
the  BCI  and/or  UGC  to  carry  out  inspections  of  such
educational  institutions  to  verify  as  to  whether  the
provisions are complied with or not.
(ii)Insofar as suggestions given by the petitioner in the
form  of  “Guidelines  for  Accessibility  for  Students  with
Disabilities in Universities/Colleges” are concerned, the UGC
shall consider the feasibility thereof by constituting a
Committee in this behalf.  In this Committee, the UGC would be
free to include persons from amongst Central Advisory Board,
State  Advisory  Boards,  Chief  Commissioner  of  State
Commissioners appointed under the Disabilities Act.  This
Committee  shall  undertake  a  detailed  study  for  making
provisions in respect of accessibility as well as pedagogy and
would also suggest the modalities for implementing those
suggestions, their funding and monitoring, etc.  The Committee
shall  also  lay  down  the  time  limits  within  which  such26
suggestions could be implemented.  The Expert Committee may
also consider feasibility of constituting an in-house body in
each educational institution (of teachers, staff, students and
parents) for taking care of day to day needs of differently
abled persons as well as for implementation of the Schemes
that would be devised by the Expert Committee.  This exercise
shall be completed by June 30, 2018.
(iii)Report in this behalf, as well as the Action Taken
Report, shall be submitted to this Court in July, 2018.  On
receipt of the report, the matter shall be placed before the
Court.
Pending  application(s),  if  any,  stands  disposed  of
accordingly.

Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
 
1.This appeal is directed against the final judgment
and order dated 03.09.2009 passed by the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal No.
2464 of 2000 whereby the Division Bench of the High
Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein
and upheld the judgment dated 30.08.2000 passed by
the Additional Sessions Judge, Katni in Sessions Trial
No.690/1999 by which the appellant was found guilty of
1the   offence   punishable   under   Section   302/34   of   the
Indian   Penal   Code,   1860   (hereinafter   referred   to   as
“IPC”) and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and
a fine of Rs.1000/­, in default of payment of fine, to
undergo   further   rigorous   imprisonment   for   three
months.
2. In order to appreciate the issues involved in this
appeal, relevant facts need mention in brief  infra.
3.Three accused persons, namely, Satya Raj Singh
(appellant   herein),   Santosh   and   Argent   alias  Prabhu
Dayal were prosecuted for committing murder of one
person called ­ Bhaiya   alias  Narendra under Section
302/34 IPC. 
4. The   Additional   Sessions   Judge,   Katna   by   his
judgment/order dated 30.08.2000 found the appellant–
Satya   Raj   Singh   guilty   for   commission   of   murder   of
Bhaiya  alias  Narendra and accordingly convicted him
under   Section   302/34   IPC   and   sentenced   him   to
2undergo life imprisonment. So far as other two accused
namely, Santosh and Urgent   alias  Prabhu Dayal are
concerned, both were acquitted of the charge. 
5.The appellant – Satya Raj Singh felt aggrieved
and filed criminal appeal in the High Court of Madhya
Pradesh at Jabalpur. So far as the State is concerned,
no appeal was filed against that part of the order of the
Additional Sessions Judge by which two other accused,
namely, Santosh and Urgent   alias  Prabhu Dayal were
acquitted. In this way, the order of acquittal of Santosh
and Argent alias Prabhu Dayal became final.
6.By impugned order, the High Court dismissed the
appeal filed by Satya Raj Singh, which has given rise to
filing of the present appeal by way of special leave in
this Court only by the appellant­Satya Raj Singh. 
7.The case set up by the prosecution against the
accused   persons   and   which   was   proved   against   the
appellant is as follows.
38.The incident occurred on 19.09.1999 around 7
p.m. in village Imaliya. Four persons namely, Bhaiya
alias  Narendra   ­   (deceased),   Ravindra   Singh   (PW­1),
Jhallu alias Mahendra (PW­3) and Argent  alias Prabhu
Dayal were sitting on the platform (small place in front
of house) of one ­ Uli Singh.   They were chatting with
each other. 
9.At that time, the appellant along with Santosh
came there and expressed his wish to talk to Argent
alias  Prabhu   Dayal.   The   trio   then   went   near   to   the
house of one Abhay Raj Singh  alias Daddu.  
10.Argent  alias  Prabhu Dayal then came back and
called Bhaiya  alias Narendra (deceased) for two minutes
to have some talk. Bhaiya, however, replied that he has
to go to his house to serve cow. Argent   alias  Prabhu
Dayal then said to Bhaiya that there is some important
urgent   matter,   which   he   has   to   talk   with   him   and,
therefore,  he should come with him. 
411.Bhaiya accordingly went to participate in the talk
with Argent   alias  Prabhu Dayal. At that time, Jhallu,
who   was   still   sitting   on   the   platform,   told   Ravindra
Singh that they had to go to the market to purchase
some items. Ravindra Singh and Jhallu accordingly left
for the market. When they were proceeding towards the
market and reached near the house of Abhay Raj Singh,
they saw Satya Raj Singh (appellant herein) assaulting
Bhaiya  alias  Narendra with Gupti (a kind of knife) on
his neck and its nearby whereas Argent   alias  Prabhu
Dayal and Santosh were standing near to him. 
12.On   seeing   them,   Satya   Raj   Singh   (appellant
herein)   and   Santosh   both   ran   away   from   the   spot.
Jhallu   seeing   the   incident   ran   towards   Bhaiya   alias
Narendra   (deceased)   whereas   Ravindra   ran   behind
Satya   Raj   Singh.   After   covering   some   distance,   both
Satya   Raj   Singh   and   Santosh   turned   back   and
5threatened Jhallu and Ravindra not to chase them else
they would assault them also. 
13.Out of fear both gave up their chase and returned
back. Injured Bhaiya was then taken to the house of
Abhay   Raj   Singh   because   the   incident   had   occurred
near to his house. 
14.   Thereafter on next day morning, i.e., 20.09.1999,
Ravindra   (PW­1)   lodged   an   FIR   at   Police   Station
Badwara, District Katni on the basis of which crime
case No.108/1999 for commission of offence punishable
under Section 302/34 IPC was registered. The appellant
herein­Satya   Raj   Singh,     Santosh   and   Argent   alias
Prabhu Dayal were apprehended and put to trial for
commission of the aforesaid offence. Investigation was
carried   out.     Statements   of   several   persons   were
recorded.  Seizure of items was also made.  Post­mortem
report was obtained and then charge­sheet was filed.
The case was committed to  the Sessions Court for trial.
615.The   prosecution,     in   support   of   its   case,
examined as many as 16 witnesses. The statements of
accused were also recorded under Section 313 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (for short “ the Cr.P.C.”)
proceedings. 
16.As   mentioned   above,   the   Additional   Sessions
Judge   by   his   judgment/order   dated   30.08.2000
convicted   the   appellant   –   Satya   Raj   Singh   for
commission   of   the   offence   punishable   under   Section
302/34  IPC and  awarded  him life imprisonment  but
acquitted Santosh and Argent  alias Prabhu Dayal of the
charges.
17.The appellant felt aggrieved and filed appeal in
the   High   Court   of   Madhya   Pradesh   against   his
conviction and sentence. By impugned order, the High
Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction
and sentence awarded to the appellant giving rise to
7filing of the present appeal by the accused ­ Satya Raj
Singh in this Court.
18.The question, which arises for consideration in
this appeal, is whether both the Courts below (Sessions
Court and the High Court) were justified in convicting
the appellant for commission of the offence of murder of
deceased ­ Bhaiya  alias Narendra.
19.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties
and on perusal of the record of the case, we find no
merit in this appeal.
20.At   the   outset,   we   may   take   note   of   one   legal
principle   which   consistently   reiterated   by   this   Court
since inception that it is not the function of this Court
to re­assess evidence and an argument on a point of fact
which did not prevail with the Courts below cannot avail
the   appellants   in   this   Court   ( see  observation   of   the
learned Judge Saiyid Fazl Ali, J. while speaking for the
8Bench in Lachhman Singh  and others  vs. State, AIR
1952 SC 167).  
21.Yet,   we   perused   the   evidence   adduced   by   the
prosecution and also the judgments of the two Courts
below with a view to find out as to whether both the
Courts   were   justified   in   convicting   the   appellant   for
commission of the offence in question.
22.Before   the   High   Court,   the   appellant   (accused
Satya Raj Singh) had assailed the judgment/order of the
Additional Sessions Judge on two grounds. 
23.One was that the Additional Sessions Judge erred
in believing the testimony of those witnesses who were
cited by the prosecution as eye­witnesses to the incident
and   second   since   the   FIR   was   lodged   by   the
complainant (PW­1) very late, therefore, the entire case
of the prosecution becomes doubtful and weak  qua the
appellant and lastly, on appreciation of the evidence of
9the so­called eye­witnesses, no case is made out by the
prosecution against the appellant.
24.   The same argument, which was unsuccessfully
urged   before   the   High   Court,   was   again   pressed   in
service before this Court by the appellant to question
the legality and correctness of the order of conviction
and sentence but having appreciated the submissions,
we find no merit in any of them. In our view, the High
Court   was   right   in   repelling   these   submissions   and
upholding the appellant's conviction.
25.The   evidence   of   PW­1­Ravindra   Singh,   Jhallu
alias  Mahendra (PW­3), Ram Shankar (PW­2), Gitabai
(PW­6) and Abhay Raj (PW­4) proved the prosecution
case beyond reasonable doubt. 
26.So far as the evidence of PW­1 and PW­3 are
concerned, they actually saw the incident and stated
that the appellant assaulted the deceased on his neck
and its nearby with Gupti. They also deposed that both
10of them chased the appellant and Santosh on seeing the
assault made by the appellant.
27.So far as the evidence of PW­4 (Abhay Raj) is
concerned,   he   was   the   person   in   whose   house   the
deceased was brought in injured condition soon after
the incident and where he died.   PW­4 also saw the
condition of the deceased and the nature of injuries
sustained by the deceased. 
28.So far as the evidence of PW­6 is concerned, she
being  the  sister  of  deceased  rushed  to  the  house  of
Abhay   Raj   on   being   informed   of   the   incident   where
Bhaiya alias Narendra was lying in an injured condition.
She deposed that on seeing her Bhaiya hugged her and
told that the appellant had assaulted him. After some
time, Bhaiya succumbed to his injuries. 
29.Reading   the   evidence   of   the   abovementioned
witnesses   has   proved   beyond   reasonable   doubt   that
assault on Bhaiya   alias  Narendra ­ the deceased was
11made by the appellant on his neck and nearby area.
PW­5,   Dr.   R.   Sidha,   also   confirmed   the   injuries,   its
nature and the area where the injuries were sustained
by the deceased in his post­mortem report. 
30. We have not been able to notice any inconsistent
or contradictory version between these witnesses, which
may persuade us to disbelieve their evidence on any
material   issue.   In   our   view,   their   testimony   being
natural and consistent and without any contradiction as
against the version stated in FIR, the same deserves to
be believed.
31.As rightly held by the High Court, some minor
contradictions   here   and   there   without   affecting   the
substance of their statements could not be made basis
to reject their entire testimony. We, therefore, agree with
the reasoning of the High Court.
32.So   far   as   the   next   argument   of   the   learned
counsel for the appellant, that since there was delay in
12filing   of   FIR,   the   prosecution   case   should   not   be
believed, is concerned, it was also rightly repelled by the
High Court.
33. It is not in dispute that the incident in question
occurred around 7.30 p.m. on 19.09.1999, whereas the
FIR   was   lodged   by   PW­1   on   the   next   day,   i.e.,
20.09.1999 at around 9 a.m.  It is also not in dispute
that the Police Station was around 25 KM away from the
place of occurrence. 
34.In our opinion, since Bhaiya died after few hours
of the incident and by that time it was dark night, it
was, therefore, not possible for the complainant to go to
the Police Station which was around 25 KM away from
the place of occurrence immediately in the night to lodge
the report/FIR. In these circumstances, if PW­1 left for
lodging report/FIR on the next day morning and lodged
the report/FIR around 9.30 a.m. it cannot be said that
there was delay in lodging the report/FIR.
1335.We, therefore, find no good ground to interfere
with the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the
two Courts below which, in our view, rightly held the
appellant   guilty   for   commission   of   the   offence   in
question.
36.In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal is
found   to   be   devoid   of   any   merit   and   is   accordingly
dismissed.

"REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO.   2406   OF 2018
(Arising out of SLP (C) No.21364 of 2017)
ESSAR BULK TERMINAL LIMITED
& ANR.      … APPELLANTS
VERSUS
STATE OF GUJARAT & ORS.      … RESPONDENTS
J U D G M E N T
R.F. NARIMAN, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.The  present  appeal  involves  a  challenge  to  a
notification  dated  18th January,  2016,  issued  under
Section 5 of the Indian Ports Act, 1908, by which the
1State Government of Gujarat expanded the port limits of
Hazira port.  It is the case of the Appellants before us that
by doing so, the Appellants have been affected because
they  have  spent  huge  monies  on  lands  reclaimed  by
them, which would be directly affected by the expansion
of the aforesaid port limits.  
3.The  brief  facts  necessary  for  determining  the
questions that arise in this appeal are as follows.
In 1994, the parent company of the Appellants entered
into  an  agreement  with  the  Gujarat  Maritime  Board
(hereinafter referred to as “GMB”) for use of a captive
jetty in Magdalla port.   Pursuant to a Port Policy framed
by the Government of Gujarat in 1995, and a Build, Own,
Operate and Transfer (BOOT) Policy framed for private
sector participation in development of the State’s ports in
1997, the GMB issued a Global Notice for Expression of
Interest  for  Development  of  Green  Field  Site  Port
Facilities, inviting bids in the name of Hazira port project.
2A  consortium  led  by  Shell  Gas  B.V. was  selected  to
develop, operate and maintain certain facilities on leased
area in the port on a BOOT basis, together with related
LNG facilities.  Pursuant to the acceptance of its bid, Shell
Gas  B.V. created  two  subsidiaries  in  Gujarat,  namely,
Hazira  Port  Private  Limited  (HPPL)  and  Hazira  LNG
Private  Limited.    A concession  agreement  dated  22nd
April, 2002 was entered into between the GMB, the State
Government and HPPL for the purpose of development,
operation and maintenance of Hazira port by HPPL.   A
notification dated 23rd June, 2004 was issued by the State
Government notifying Hazira port and setting out its limits,
in exercise of powers under Section 4(2) of the Indian
Ports  Act.   This  was  carved  out  of  the  port  limits  of
Magdalla port, which was so reduced as to exclude the
aforesaid Hazira port.  
4.Sometime in the year 2000, the Appellants had set
up a shallow draft captive jetty of 456 meters at the mouth
3of  the  River  Tapi,  which  connected  to  the  sea  at  a
distance of about 7 kilometers.  The initial depth of the
aforesaid draft captive jetty was about 3 to 4 meters.  
5.As many as three Memorandums of Understanding
(MOU)  were  entered  into  between  the  Appellants,  the
GMB and the State Government in the years 2007, 2011
and 2013, inter alia, for development of a RORO terminal
and  development  of  the  water-front  of  3000  meters.
Each of these MOUs was only for a period of 12 months.  
6.On  25th November,  2010,  HPPL  identified  Adani
Hazira  Port  Private  Limited  (Adani)  as  its
sub-concessionaire, and entered into a sub-concession
agreement with Adani on the same date. On 21st July,
2014,  HPPL  requested  the  GMB  for
amendment/extension of its port facilities.   After entering
into an MOU with Adani, dated 27th February, 2015, for
exploring  business  opportunities,  which  fell  through,
HPPL, by its letter dated 14th March, 2015, revised its
4request for amendment of port facilities, citing the need
for additional back-up area, as a result of which a much
larger area than what was originally asked for was now
requested. This larger area would include lands reclaimed
and/or to be reclaimed by Essar by dumping earth out of
dredging  the  canal  next  to  the  captive  jetty  of  the
Appellants.  This proposal was approved by the GMB by
its resolution dated 19th March, 2015.   Meanwhile, on 7th
April, 2015, Essar wrote a detailed representation to the
GMB stating its objections to the extension of port limits
on  various  grounds.   On  21st April,  2015,  the  State
Government wrote a letter to the GMB, inter alia, asking it
to examine the aforesaid representation of the Appellants.
A similar representation dated 29th May, 2015 was also
made by the Appellants to the Chief Principal Secretary of
the State.  By a detailed letter dated 16th July, 2015, the
GMB  dismissed  all  the  objections  of  the  Appellants.
However, on 26th August, 2015, the State Government
requested the GMB to reconsider the issue of extension
5of  port  facilities  in  its  forthcoming  board  meeting,  and
send its recommendations to the Government in relation
thereto.   On 28th September, 2015, the GMB passed a
resolution in which it recommended the original proposal
submitted by HPPL on 21st July, 2014.   However, on 5th
December,  2015,  the  Chief  Principal  Secretary  to  the
Chief Minister circulated a note stating that the number of
vessels at the port was expected to increase dramatically
from 30-40 to 70-80, and that the port limits need to be
extended  to  accommodate  customs  formalities,  safety
etc.  In view thereof, it was necessary to make adequate
facilities for anchorage of all the said vessels and that,
therefore,  the  GMB’s  resolution  of  19th March,  2015
should be strictly implemented.  On 11th December, 2015,
the State Government then wrote to the GMB stating that
the port facilities will be extended in terms of the GMB
resolution dated 19th March, 2015.   Following this, the
requisite notification dated 18th January, 2016, which has
been impugned by the Appellants in a writ petition before
6the Gujarat High Court, was then issued under Section 5
of the Indian Ports Act.  
7.Shri Mihir Joshi, learned senior counsel appearing
on  behalf  of  the  Appellants,  has  argued  that  the  first
proposal alone, which was sent on 21st July, 2014, ought
to  have  been  accepted  by  the  GMB.   The  second
proposal for the increased area would directly impinge
upon the land that was reclaimed or to be reclaimed by
the Appellants, after spending huge monies for the same.
The learned senior counsel specifically stated that the
approval  for  the  second  proposal  was  done  in  great
haste, within a matter of four days.   He went on to add
that the State Government had, by its letters dated 1st
June, 2013, recommended to the Ministry of Environment
to  grant  CRZ  clearance  to  Essar  for  the  proposed
expansion of port facilities, which included additional 334
hectares of land.  It was his case that the said Ministry, on
6th May, 2014, granted the aforesaid clearance, despite
7which the expanded port limits would now eat into the
aforesaid area, as only an area of 140 hectares out of 195
hectares, which was reclaimed by the Appellants, could
be  used  by  the  Appellants.    He  argued  that  various
assurances were given and MOUs were entered into with
the Appellants, on the basis of which huge investments
were made, and at the very least the doctrine of legitimate
expectation  would  be  attracted.  He  attacked  the
notification stating that it was ultra vires Section 5 of the
Indian Ports Act, which required public interest alone to
be seen.   Indirectly, the extension of the limits of Hazira
port would  grant HPPL an extended port area without
bidding,  which  would  be  contrary  to  the  Gujarat
Infrastructure Development Act, 1999.  According to him,
the overlapping of area with Essar was only in the second
proposal, which was wholly arbitrarily recommended by
the GMB initially approving the second proposal of 2015,
and thereafter correctly approving only the first proposal
of 2014.  The GMB’s resolution of 28th September, 2015
8was  the  correct  decision,  which  could  not  have  been
arbitrarily interfered with by the Chief Principal Secretary
of the Chief Minister, on the basis of which the impugned
notification has been issued. 
8.On  the  other  hand,  Shri  Harish  Salve,  learned
senior  counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  State  of
Gujarat, painstakingly took us through the Port Policy of
1995 and the BOOT Policy of 1997.   According to the
learned  senior  counsel,  since  13  berths  were  to  be
constructed, out of which  5 berths have already been
constructed,  a  total  of  1011  hectares  was  already
allocated for port related activities to HPPL.  This would
be  clear  from  a  reading  of  the  detailed  project  report
(DPR) of 2010, and this being the case, the expansion of
port limits by the impugned notification was well within the
originally conceived area of 1011 hectares.  He referred to
and  relied  upon  affidavits  submitted  by  the  State
Government as well as the GMB before the High Court, to
9argue  that  Essar’s  demands  for  reclaimed  land  had
nothing to do with the expansion of the limits of Hazira
port.   They operated in two completely different spheres.
He  further  went  on  to  state  that  no  permission  under
Section 35 of the Gujarat Maritime Board Act, 1981 has
been given to reclaim any land, which was a condition
precedent to Essar’s demands for further reclaimed land.
He also pointed out that, being a captive port, Essar’s
production was much less than what was projected and,
in fact, only 30% of the cargo that it was supposed to
handle was being handled.   According to the learned
senior counsel, the objections to the expansion of Hazira
port’s limits are completely misconceived, inasmuch as
what the Appellants really sought was for their captive
port  to  become  a  commercial  port  by  bypassing  the
provisions of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act.
In  any  case,  the  Appellants’  captive  jetty  was  grossly
underutilised  and  the  Appellants  demands  for  grant  of
reclaimed land has nothing to do with HPPL demanding
10an alteration to the limits of Hazria Port, so as to cater to
the increased traffic of a commercial port open to all.
9.Shri  Tushar  Mehta,  learned  Additional  Solicitor
General appearing on behalf of the GMB, adopted the
arguments of Shri Salve.  In addition, he defended the
GMB’s  approval  dated  19th March,  2015,  stating  that
despite the fact that the said approval came within four
days of the HPPL letter dated 14th March, 2015, this paled
into  insignificance  as  nothing  followed  from  this.  Also,
according to the learned ASG, on an examination of the
official records, he found nothing in support of the GMB’s
turn-around  on  28th September, 2015,  which  accepted
only  the  first  and  not  the  second  proposal  of  HPPL.
According  to  him,  finally  what  was  done  by the  State
Government was in public interest and for good reason. 
10.Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing
on  behalf  of  HPPL  and  Adani,  painstakingly  took  us
through various letters written by the Appellants to the
11GMB and permissions given.  According to the learned
senior counsel, it was clear that from a reading of the
initial proposals of 2005 and 2006, and the later proposals
of  the  Appellants  that  their  real  aim  was  to  conduct
commercial operations on their captive jetty, which would
circumvent the need for a global tender as required by the
Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act.  In essence, he
also submitted that as the Appellants could claim no right
or expectation of any sort and as the present petition was
not a public interest litigation, the writ petition should have
been dismissed at the threshold as the Appellants could
show no right or expectation of any kind.  Dr. Singhvi and
Shri Harin P. Raval broadly supported the contentions of
Shri Sibal.
11.Before dealing with the arguments of counsel, it is
important to set out some of the important provisions of
the relevant Acts before us.  Sections 3(9), 4 and 5 of the
Indian Ports Act read as under:
12“3(9). “Government”, as respects major ports,
for all purposes, and, as respects other ports
for the purposes of making rules under clause
(p) of section 6(1) and of the appointment and
control of port health officers under section 17,
means the Central Government, and save as
aforesaid, means the State Government. 
4. Power to extend or withdraw the Act or
certain portions thereof 
(1)  Government  may,  by  notification  in  the
Official Gazette.- 
(a) extend this Act to any port in which this Act
is not in force or to any part of any navigable
river or channel which leads to a port and in
which this Act is not in force; 
(b) specially extend the provisions of section
31 or section 32 to any port to which they
have not been so extended; 
(c) withdraw this Act or section 31 or section
32 from any part thereof in which it is for the
time being in force. 
(2) A notification under clause (a) or clause (b)
of subsection (1) shall define the limits of the
area  to  which  it  refers.  
(3) Limits defined under sub-section (2) may
include  any  piers,  jetties,  landing-places,
wharves, quays, docks and other works made
on  behalf  of  the  public  for  convenience  of
traffic,  for  safety  of  vessels  or  for  the
improvement,  maintenance  or  good
government  of  the  port  and  its  approaches
whether  within  or  without  high-water-mark,
13and, subject to any rights of private property
therein, any portion of the shore or bank within
fifty yards of higher-water-mark. 
(4)  In  sub-section  (3)  the  expression
“high-water-mark”  means  the  highest  point
reached by ordinary tides at any season of the
year. 
5. Alteration of limits of ports  
(1) The Government may, subject to any rights
of private property, alter the limits of any port
in which this Act is in force. 
Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is
hereby declared that the power conferred on
the Government by this sub-section includes
the power to alter the limits of any port by
uniting with that port any other port or any part
of any other port. 
(2) When the Government alters the limits of a
port under sub-section (1), it shall declare or
describe, by notification in the Official Gazette,
and by such other means, if any, as it thinks
fit, the precise extend of such limits.
Section 35(1) of the Gujarat Maritime Board Act reads as
under :
“35. (1) No person shall make, erect or fix
within the limits of a port or port approaches,
any wharf, dock, quay, stage, jetty, pier, place
of  anchorage,  erection  or  mooring  or
undertake any reclamation of foreshore within
the  said  limits  except  with  the  previous
14permission in writing of the Board and subject
to such conditions, if any, as the Board may
specify.
(2) If any person makes, erects or fixes any
wharf, dock, quay, stage, jetty, pier, place of
anchorage, erection or mooring or undertakes
reclamation of foreshore in contravention of
sub-section  (1),  the  Board  may,  by  notice
require such person to remove it within such
time as may be specified in the notice and if
the person fails so to remove it, the Board
may cause it to be removed at the expense of
that person.”
Further, Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Gujarat Infrastructure
Development Act read as under:
“Section 8 - Selection of a person
(1) A concession agreement for undertaking a
project may be entered into with a person who
is  selected  through  a  competitive  public
bidding as provided in section  9 or by inviting
comparative bids as provided in section 10 or
by  direct  negotiation  as  provided  in
section 10A.
(2)  The  matters  relating  to  competitive
bidding, inviting comparative bids and direct
negotiation shall  be  such  as  may  be
prescribed.
Section  9  -  Selection  of  person  by
competitive public bidding
15On the acceptance of the recommendation of
the  Board  made  under  sub-section  (2)  of
section  5,  the  State  Government,  the
Government agency or, as the case may be,
the specified Government agency shall select
a  developer  for  the  project  through
competitive public bidding in the manner as
may be prescribed.
Section 10 - Inviting comparative bids.
(1) Where a proposal for undertaking a project
and  a  proposed  concession  agreement
prepared  by a person are submitted to the
State Government, the Government agency or
a specified Government agency, it may, 
(a) consider the proposal and the proposed
concession  agreement  from  all  aspects
(including  technical  and  financial)  and  if
necessary, modify  the  same  in  consultation
with  the  person  who  has  submitted  the
proposal  and  the  proposed  concession
agreement; and 
(b)  submit  the  proposal  and  the  proposed
concession agreement to the Board, if - (i) the
cost of the project exceeds the limit provided
by regulations under sub-section (1) of section
5, and 
(ii)  the  undertaking  of  the  project  does  not
require  financial  assistance  from  the  State
Government, the Government agency or the
specified Government agency.
(2) On acceptance of the recommendation of
the Board  made  under  sub-section  (2)  of
section 5,  the  State  Government,  the
16Government agency or, as the case may be,
the specified Government agency  shall adopt
the  proposal  as  the  basis  for  selecting  a
person with whom concession agreement for
undertaking the project may be entered into,
and  for  selecting  such  person,  the  State
Government, the Government agency or, as
the case may be, the specified Government
agency shall  follow  the  procedure  of
competitive  public  bidding  prescribed  under
section 9.
(3) Where a person is selected by following
the  procedure  of  the  competitive  public
bidding (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the

person shall be compared with the proposal
which is earlier  submitted by a person to the
State  Government,  the  Government  agency
or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  specified
Government  agency  under  sub-section
(1) (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  earlier
proposer”).
(4) Where the proposal of the earlier proposer
is  not  preferable  to  the  proposal  of  the
selected person, the earlier proposer  shall be
given  an  opportunity  to  make  his  proposal
competitive with that of the selected person
within a period of thirty days from the date on
which he has been given the opportunity and
where the earlier proposer fails to do so within
the  said  period,  the  State  Government,  the
Government agency or, as the case may be,
the specified Government agency may enter
into a contract with the selected person.
17(5) (a) Where a concession agreement has
not  been  entered  into  with  the  earlier
proposer,  the  cost  of  preparation  of  the
proposal  and  the  concession  agreement
incurred  by him shall  be  reimbursed  by  the
State  Government,  the  Government  agency
or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  specified
Government  agency  and  on  such
reimbursement,  the  proposal  and  the
concession  agreement  submitted  by  the
earlier proposer  shall be the property of the
State  Government,  the  Government  agency
or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  specified
Government agency.
(b) The  cost of preparation of the proposal
and  the  concession  agreement  shall  be
determined  in  such  manner  as  may  be
prescribed.”
12.It is also necessary to set out some parts of the Port
Policy of 1995 and the BOOT Policy of 1997.
“Gujarat Port Policy
Gujarat  envisages  an  integrated  port
development strategy, consisting of creation of
port  facilities,  industrialisation  and
development  of  infrastructure  facilities  like
roads  and  railways  in  the  hinterland.  It  is
estimated  that  around  3  billion  dollars  (Rs.
10,000  crores)  would  be  required  to  create
new  port  facilities  along  with  necessary
infrastructure in the coming 5 years. In view of
the fact that ships of large sizes are used in
the transportation, for the economies of scale
18in  international  trade,  ports  would  be
developed  with  direct  berthing  facilities  and
speedy mechanical handling facilities, so as to
reduce waiting period of the ships and saving
in the cargo expenses. To expedite creation of
port facilities by 2000 AD, it is proposed to
have the participation of private enterprise in
the development of port infrastructure.
The following ports are identified for exclusive
investment by private sector: 
1. Simar Power port 
2. Mithiwirdi Steel and Automobile port 
3. Dholera General Cargo port 
4. Hazira Industrial port 
5. Vansi-Borsi Petroleum & liquid chemical   
    port 
6. Maroli Industrial port 
These ports will be privatised through a global
tender bid. Gujarat Maritime Board will do a
preliminary techno-economic feasibility report
of  all  these  five  locations  except  Dholera,
through a global bid to facilitate prospective
bidders. Dholera, being an ancient port and
privatisation bids were invited in the past, no
techno-economic  feasibility  will  be  done  for
this location. Dholera port will be the first port
to  be  opened  up  for  privatisation  by global
tendering. For remaining locations based on
the preliminary techno-economic study, global
tenders  will  be  invited  for  privatisation.
General guidelines are given below.
19These port locations are to be given on BOMT
(Built, Operate, Maintain and Transfer) basis.
The investment in infrastructure projects like
ports  being  capital  intensive,  with  higher
gestation period compared to other sectors of
investment,  Government  of  Gujarat  is  very
particular that the port projects taken up by
private entrepreneurs should be a profitable
proposition  to  them.  The  viability  of  port
project  depends  upon  the  location,  the
maritime conditions, scale of investment and
the  kind  of  cargo  to  be  handled.  The  port
project has to be assured at a reasonable rate
of return after accounting for capital recovery
and interest repayment. Hence, it is essential
that each port project is evaluated based on
an investment analysis; consisting of a capital
cost, revenue receipts, revenue  expenditure
and capital recovery. Gujarat Maritime Board
will study the financing pattern adopted by the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
and  other  Financial  Institutions  to  evolve  a
comprehensive package. 
Only the wharfage charges/waterfront charges
will be as per the schedule decided by Gujarat
Maritime Board. The promoters will be free to
charge  any  other  service  charges  with  the
prior approval of the Gujarat Maritime Board.
After BOMT period, the ownership of the port
and its assets will get transferred to Gujarat
Maritime Board and they will examine to give
it further on lease basis to the same promoter.
The terms and conditions will be finalised at
that  time.  The  general  guidelines  for
investment analysis and capital recovery for
20the port projects to determine BOMT period
will be announced within 2 months. 
CAPTIVE JETTIES FOR INDUSTRIES 
To  ensure  that  the  new  port  projects  are
financially  viable,  permissions  for  captive
jetties  would  be  given  only  in  exceptional
cases, looking to the quantum of investment
and  the  need  for  specialised  facilities.  All
industrial units would be encouraged to make
use of new port facilities being set up. 
To take care of the increasing traffic until the
completion  of  the  new  port  projects,  it  is
decided to make use of the existing captive
jetties  already  constructed  or  under
construction,  for  which  the  permission  has
already been given, to be utilized for specific
commercial cargos with the prior approval of
the Gujarat Maritime Board. 
(1)  This  facility  would  be  available  for  a
reasonable  period  till  new  ports  become
operative. GMB will review the policy taking
into account the progress made in the new
ports. 
(2) Gujarat Maritime Board would be entitled
to collect full wharfage charges on the cargos
handled, which are not captive to the industrial
units. 
Looking to the huge amount of cargo handled
in a short period, captive Single Point Mooring
(SPM) facilities of industries located in Gujarat
will  be  charged  at  concessional  rate  of
21wharfage  for  their  captive  consumption.
Nevertheless, for captive cargo for industries
located  outside  Gujarat  and  non-captive
commercial  and  industrial  cargo,  will  be
charged  full  wharfage  by  Gujarat  Maritime
Board.
Gujarat BOOT Policy
“Developer”- The word “Developer” has been
used in this document to convey the various
roles  played  by  private  parties  at  different
stages of the development of the port.
(III) OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OF DIFFERENT
PARTIES
1. Ownership rights
of the GovernmentThe Government is vested with
sovereign  rights  as  owner,
overseer  and  conservator  of
the  waterfront  and  licensor  to
the Contract.
2.  Ownership
Rights  and
responsibilities  of
the DeveloperThe  Ownership  rights  of  the
Developer would include:
•The  right  to  mortgage,
hypothecate  or  to  execute
such  covenants  as  may  be
required  for  effectively
vesting a charge on the port
assets in favour of a lender to
the project.
•The  right  to  sell,  convey  or
transfer to another entity, the
right  title  and  interest  and
concession  vested  in  the
Developer, on the request of
a  lender  to  the  project,
22subject  to  contractual
documents.  The  new
Developer will be selected by
the lender in consultation with
the  GMB,  and  if  necessary,
the  terms  and  conditions  of
the  concession  Agreement
may be renegotiated.
xxx xxx xxx
6.  Expansion  of
facilities  and
Competition
between ports(a) Expansion of facilities
The  developers  would  be
encouraged to add capacity over
and  above  the  capacity
contracted  in  the  concession
agreement. Such expansions will
be eligible for incentives by the
Government,  such  as  land
acquisition,  extension  of  royalty
holidays etc.
At the time of the signing of the
Concession  Agreement,  the
Developer  will  submit,  and  get
approved  by  GMB,  a  broad
perspective  plan  for  the
development  of  the  port  in  the
next fifteen to twenty years. The
Government  will  not  place
restrictions on any expansion and
further  development  of  the  port
which  is  within  the  envisaged
perspective  plan,  subject  to
statutory clearances. Expansions
outside  the  scope  of  this  plan
would be subject to the approval
23of the GMB.
(b) Competition between ports
The  Government  would
encourage  competition  between
ports.  The  following,  however,
would be ensured: 
•The  development  of  the  ten
ports  would  be  appropriately
phased over a period. 
•Permission  to  set  up  captive
jetties  would  not  be  granted,
save  in  exceptional
circumstances.
13.At  this  point,  it  is  important  to  refer  to  the
correspondence between the Appellants and the GMB.
By their letters dated 11th July, 2005 and 13th October,
2006, the Appellants stated that as Essar Steel was in the
process of doubling its steel production capacity and that
it was proposed to handle cargo around 25 MMT, it would
require a captive jetty of 550 meters.  This would be in
addition to the jetty which was already constructed of 592
meters plus 456 meters. In addition to the aforesaid, the
Appellants sought permission to deepen the navigational
24channel  upto  8  meters  depth,  so  as  to  enable  direct
berthing  of  deep  draught  vessels  up  to  75,000  dead
weight tonnage (DWT).  For deepening the channel, the
dredged  material  would  have  to  be  dumped  and  the
Appellants sought permission, vide their letter dated 2nd
March, 2007, to dump the dredged material on an area of
about 252 hectares on the north side of the mangroves.
In addition to the 550 meters jetty, the Appellants also
requested the GMB to allot 38 hectares of back-up area.
By  a  letter  dated  14th June,  2007,  the  GMB  granted
in-principle  approval  for  allotment  of  400  meters
waterfront, with back-up area, so as to create a direct
berthing port, in which the channel could be dredged, so
as to obtain a draft of 8 meters. Apart from stating that
Essar will  have to obtain all required permissions and
clearances, four conditions are of importance in this letter
and are set out hereinbelow:
“3. The new channel to be created by Essar
will  be  common  user  channel  and  will  be
allowed to be used by all other users. Essar
25shall not be entitled to recover any charges
from other users, if they use the new channel.
7. The ownership of reclaimed land shall vest
with  the  Government  of  Gujarat/Gujarat
Maritime Board.
8. Essar shall not claim for reimbursement of
any expenditure incurred for this reclamation. 
10. Essar has to reclaim 319.86 hectares area
of  inter  tidal/mud  flats  except  67  hectares
allotted to M/s HPPL and the portion of area in
front of 67 hectares towards sea.” 
14.Vide  their  letter  dated  29th August,  2007,  the
Appellants demanded that 1100 meters, in addition to the
550  meters  waterfront  that  was  applied  for  earlier, be
given.   The  Appellants  also  sought  permission  for
allotment  of  252  hectares  of  land  to  be  reclaimed  as
back-up area.  By their letter dated 1st October, 2012, the
GMB granted in-principle approval for allotment of 1100
meters waterfront to the Appellants. 
15.By  their  letter  dated  15th October,  2008,  the
Appellants asked the GMB to allow them to dredge the
channel  from  8  meters  depth  to  10  meters  depth  to
26accommodate capesize vessels of 105,000 DWT.  Since
material  dredged  from  the  channel  would  have  to  be
dumped, an additional area of 316 hectares, towards the
south of the mangroves, to dump the material and reclaim
the said area was applied for.  No such permission was
granted by the GMB to go from a depth of 8 meters to 10
meters  or  to  reclaim  any  area  to  the  south  of  the
mangroves.  Shri  Mihir  Joshi,  however,  pointed  out  a
completion certificate dated 11th February, 2010, in which
it was mentioned that the width and depth of the channel
is being increased to 300 meters and 10 meters below
CD respectively in Phase-2.  However, this would clearly
not amount to permission for the same, as all that was
stated in the completion certificate was a reference to a
deep water berth of 8 meters depth below CD, the 10
meters depth being something which may be increased in
future. 
2716.Despite this, what is clear from the record is that the
Appellants appear to have actually dredged the channel
to a depth of 14 meters and appear to have reclaimed an
area of 164 hectares plus 170 hectares to the south of the
mangroves, without any permission at all.  When this was
pointed out to Shri Mihir Joshi, the answer given was that
when permission is granted under Section 35(1) of the
Gujarat  Maritime  Board  Act,  a  letter  granting  such
permission specifically says that it is permission that is
granted under Section 35(1) and for this purpose, a letter
dated 2nd August, 2008 was referred to.  According to him,
therefore, the letter dated 14th June, 2007, which referred
only to an NOC for reclamation, could not be given the
status of permission under Section 35(1).  According to
the learned counsel, therefore, if Section 35(1) were to be
read with Section 35(2), it would be clear that permission
for reclamation would only be necessary if a private asset
were  to  be  created  in  the  hands  of  a  private  person.
However, it is clear that the asset to be created belonged
28only to the Government of Gujarat and it was for the GMB
to grant permission to the Appellants to use the same.
We are afraid that it is difficult for us to accept this line of
argument.  Section 35(1) is couched in negative language
and  does  not  refer  to  private  rights  being  created.
Section  35(2) cannot be read so  as  to throw light  on
Section 35(1), as under Section 35(2), the GMB is only
given a discretionary power to require a person, who has
acted in contravention of Section 35(1), to remove the
illegal  erection.   The  wide  language  of  Section  35(1)
cannot be whittled down by Section 35(2) in the manner
argued by Shri Joshi, as the GMB may or may not utilise
the discretionary power granted to it under Section 35(2).
The plain language of Section 35(1) cannot be curtailed
by reading by inference, into sub-section (2), the fact that
the GMB may, by notice, require a person to remove an
erection, only when it has been made without previous
permission, so as to create a private asset in the hands of
a private person.  The wide language of Section 35(1)
29makes it clear that any reclamation within the limits of the
GMB  cannot  be  carried  out  except  with  the  previous
permission in writing of the GMB. It is clear, therefore, that
dredging to a depth of below 8 meters and reclamation of
any area to the south of the mangroves was done by the
Appellants in the teeth of Section 35(1) of the Gujarat
Maritime Board Act. 
17.Mr. Sibal laid great stress on the letter dated 15th
November, 2012 to show that, in point of fact, what the
Appellants  were  really  angling  for  was  to  conduct
commercial operations beyond the captive requirements
of  the  Essar  Steel  plant  at  Hazira.   This  letter, while
asking for an addition of 3700 meters in addition to the
existing 1100 meters waterfront, also went on to speak of
developing a 700 meters berth, along with the GMB, for
handling  commercial  cargo.  Apart  from  this,  Essar
planned to build a world class container terminal and a
dry  dock,  which  would  serve  the  shipping  industry
30generally.  It  also  proposed  to  reclaim  a  further  334
hectares land on the southern side with  the additional
dredged material.  A perusal of this letter would leave no
doubt about the fact that despite Essar Steel’s production
being  at  much  less  than  what  was  projected,  the
Appellants’ continued demands would show that the real
motive was to go beyond a captive jetty and to develop a
commercial port which, as we have seen, cannot be done
without a global tender under the Gujarat Infrastructure
Development Act.
18.As stated hereinabove, as many as three MOUs
were executed between the Appellants, the GMB and the
State Government, which  MOUs  were  valid only for a
period of 12 months and were stated not to have granted
any  right  to  the  Appellants,  who  would  incur  all  the
expenditure for the same.   This being the case, it is a
little difficult to appreciate Shri Joshi’s contention that any
legitimate  expectation  could  be  based  on  any  of  the
31aforesaid expired MOUs.   The High Court is correct in its
conclusion that no such expectation could possibly have
arisen out of the aforesaid MOUs or the correspondence
between the Appellants and the GMB referred to.  
19.It is also important to note from the correspondence
between the Appellants and the GMB, that the Appellants
were clearly told that the land to be reclaimed by the
Appellants would not only belong to the Government of
Gujarat, but also that the GMB could utilize the aforesaid
land  for  any  purpose.   What  seems  to  emerge  on  a
reading  of  the  letters  between  the  parties  is  that  the
Appellants wished to dredge the canal, at their own cost,
which  was  next  to  their  captive  jetty,  for  their  own
purposes,  for  which  they  obtained  the  necessary
permission.   However, since dumping of earth, which
would emerge as a consequence of dredging, into the
open sea would be extremely expensive, it was stated
that  instead  this  earth  could  be  dumped  to  create
32reclaimed land next to the captive jetty, which would then
benefit both the Appellants and the GMB.  In point of fact,
140 hectares out of 195 hectares that is reclaimed by the
Appellants  is  allocated  to  the  Appellants  for  their  own
purposes, the balance to be given as and when a jetty of
1100  meters  plus  3700  meters  of  waterfront  is
constructed.   The argument that huge amounts had been
spent to reclaim land is wholly fallacious - huge amounts
were spent to dredge a canal which was permitted as the
Appellants  alone  were  to  bear  the  cost,  and  as  an
increased draft would benefit all, as the canal was open to
all  to  use.  Therefore,  any  plea  as  to  a  legitimate
expectation  of  reclaimed  land  being  allocated  for  the
Appellants’  own  use,  thanks  to  large  amounts  being
spent,  is  contrary  to  the  correspondence  by  the
Appellants themselves.  
20.In point of fact, it is important at this stage to advert
to the GMB’s detailed reply, dated 16th July, 2015, to the
33State  Government,  in  which  it  examined  the
representation  made  by the  Appellants  dated  7th April,
2015 and rejected the same.  This letter expressly states
that it deals with the representation of Essar, with the
comments of the GMB on the side of the representation of
Essar.  The following extracts from the aforesaid letter are
of great importance and are set out hereinbelow:
No. Representation  of
Essar  Ports  Ltd.  to
Hon’ble  CMComments
1.EBTL  through  an
investment  of  more
than Rs. 2000 Cr. has
been  operating  deep
draft 550m jetty since
2010 and caters to the
Essar’s  Steel  plant
cargo  requirement.
The   steel  plant   is
expected to ramp  up
its  production  in  line
with  its  10  MMTPA
capacity   and  would
require  augmented
marine  facility   and
back  up  area  for
handling its increased
cargo requirements.The  Proposed  port  limit
excludes  the  area  of
550m jetty and back-up
area  behind  the  jetty.
Hence, it has no effect.
The present capacity of
the  steel  plant  is  10
MMTPA  whereas  the
actual steel production at
the  plant  in  the  year
2014-15  is  only  3.15
MMTPA. No firm/definite
plans  for  augmentation
in  steel  production  are
submitted.
342. GMB had given NOC
for reclamation of 319
ha.  in  June  2007,
pursuant  to  which
Essar  started  the
process  for
development  of  back
up  land  for  its
expansion.  The
allotment  of  the
reclaimed  land  to
Essar  was  also
decided in the meeting
held  under  the
chairmanship  of  the
then  Chief  Secretary
in  November  2009.
EBTL has developed a
channel of more than
7  km  length  with
capacity to handle up
to  11m  draft  vessel
and has plans to take
it up to 14m draft and
have  waterfront  of
more than 5 km.GMB  had granted NOC
to  dump  dredged
material  for  310  Ha.  of
land in the mudflat area
shown  in  the  map
attached as Annexure 3.
However,  as  per  the
DILR  report,  the  actual
reclaimed  area  is  only
approx. 195 Ha. Out of
this  area  approx.   98
hectares  of  reclaimed
land is excluded from the
proposed  expansion  of
port  limit.  Further,  a
specific  condition  was
mentioned in the NOC of
GMB that the ownership
of  the  reclaimed  land
shall  vest  with
GMB/GOG.
Further  it  is  also  be
noted that NOC granted
to EBTL for reclamation
is also beneficial to the
company.  In  case  of
non-issuance  of  NOC
for dumping the dredged
material  in  the  mudflat
area  (very  close  to
dredged  area)  the
company  had  to  dump
the dredged material in
the  mid  sea  (very  far)
which would have been
expensive.
3. In  order  to  develop The  proposal  for
35commercial  port
facilities,  EBTL
submitted  a  proposal
to GMB in  2008 and
signed  MOU  with
GMB for expansion by
3.7  km.  waterfront
along  with  the
associated  back  up
land  during  vibrant
Gujarat  2013  in  the
presence  of  Shri.
Narendra  Modi-
Hon’ble Prime Minister
of  India.  Pursuant  to
this  Essar  has
invested  substantial
amount  in  terms  of
time  and  money  for
development  of  the
same.  After  the
necessary
recommendation  from
the  Government  of
Gujarat  EBTL  has
received  the
environment clearance
of 6th May 2014.  EBTL
has  made  investment
of  more  than  Rs.
15000 Cr. till date for
development  of
waterfront  and  land
reclamation  (233  Ha)
and is in the process
of reclaiming further in
order  to  undertakedevelopment  of
commercial  ports
facilities  was  received.
But,  the  permission
granted to Essar is only
for captive purpose and
thus, without performing
bidding process, there is
no  policy  of  GOG  to
convert  captive  port
facilities  into  a
commercial  port
terminal.  Further  HPPL
has already rights under
concession agreement to
develop  common
commercial port facilities
cannot  be  accepted.
GMC or GOG has never
granted such permission
for  commercial  port
facilities development by
Essar.
36their  planned
expansion  while  their
application  remains
pending.
6 The  proposed
expansion  of  port
limits  not  only
constrains  the
existing  steel  plant
operations  but,  also
infringe  on  EBTL
expansion  as
explained  above,
thereby  jeopardizing
the  proposed  port
facilities  for  industry.
Any  step  which
restricts  EBTL’s
development  plans
would  deprive a port
based  industry  of  its
growth  and  realizing
its full potential.The future plans of EBTL
are  for  commercial  port
operation.  There  is  no
policy to convert captive
port  facilities  into
commercial port facilities
as  there  is  no  bidding
process involved. Hence,
the  same  may  not  be
acceptable.
378. Essar plant at Hazira
is  the  largest
integrated steel  plant
facility  in  India  at  a
single  location  and
any  impact  on  the
operation of the same
would  be  lead  to
substantial loss to the
exchequer.  Essar
group  has  invested
more than INR 44500
Cr.  in  the  Hazira
complex  in  its  steel,
power  and  ports
business  group
infrastructure.Essar  has  following

Further,  GOG  has
approved  further  1100m
waterfront for deep water
jetty  (3rd expansion)  for
which  construction
permission  is  yet  to  be
accorded  by  GMB.
Adding  this  1100m
waterfront,  total
jetty/wharf of 2698m will
be utilized by EBTL.
38Against  the  capacity  of
25  MMTPA,  EBTL  has
handled  cargo  as  per
Annexure  4.  It  is  seen
that during the last year
2014-15  Essar  has
handled  total  10  million
tons of cargo against the
existing  capacity  of  25
MMTPA.
Further,  the  company
has  gradually  reduced
usages of the main jetty
of  456m,  the  cost  of
construction has already
been  set  off  and  full
wharfage  is  payable.
EBTL  has  reduced  the
cargo  handling  at  the
main  jetty  and  it  has
diverted  to  550m  deep
water jetty where the set
off  of  the  cost  is
available  and  thus,  the
concessional  wharfage
rate is payable.
In  furtherance  to  the  above,  the  following
points may please be seen:
(1)- (3) xxx xxx xxx
39(4) ESSAR has submitted details vide letter
dated 7th April, 2015 of various proposals to
GMB  for  development  of  waterfront  and
back-up area from time to time. GMB as a
regulatory authority scrutinizes every proposal
and submits to Govt. for necessary approval.
It is to be noted that GMB granted NOC for
dumping dredge material in mudflat area at
Magdalla  to  ESSAR  vide  letter  dated  14th
June, 2007 (Annexure 5) with a condition that
the  ownership  of  reclaimed  land  shall  vest
with GMB/GOG (Condition No.7) and ESSAR
shall  not  claim  reimbursement  for  any
expenditure,  incurred  for  this  reclamation
(Condition No 8).” 
21.A  perusal  of  the  objections  of  Essar  and  the
comments offered by the GMB would show that, first and
foremost, actual steel production at the plant is way below
capacity, with no firm or definite plans for augmentation.
In fact, in the GMB’s affidavit filed in the High Court, it is
stated that only 30% of the total capacity of cargo sought
to be projected by the Appellants from 2011 onwards was,
in fact, being handled by the Appellants.   Also, it was
noted that the reclaimed land will be of the ownership of
either  the  Government  or  the  GMB,  and,  that  it  is
40beneficial  to  the  company,  as  otherwise  the  dredged
material would have to be dumped in the sea which would
have been very expensive.  However, Shri Joshi referred
us to a statement, made in a rejoinder affidavit by the
Appellants in the High Court, to the effect that the cost of
dumping dredged material to reclaim land was at least
twice  as  much  as  the  cost  of  dumping  the  dredged
material  in  the  sea.   This  bald  averment  made  in  an
affidavit,  without  any  supporting  material,  cannot  be
accepted at its face value. The answer to objection 3 is
again of great importance, in that the GMB was alive to
the  fact  that  Essar  is  really  attempting  to  convert  its
captive jetty into a commercial port, without entering into
any bidding process, contrary to the Gujarat Infrastructure
Development Act.  Further, in answer to objection 8, the
GMB states that the jetty is 1598 meters long with the
further 1100 meters which the Government has approved
for a capacity of 25 MMTPA, against which Essar has
41handled only 10 million metric tonnes of cargo in the year
2014-15.
22.At this point it is also important to note that the
GMB’s affidavit filed in the High Court also specifically
states  that  the  reclaiming  of  334  hectares  of  land  by
dredging  the  channel  to  14  meters’  depth  was  never
approved by the GMB.  Thus, the argument that the area
of  170  hectares  and  164  hectares  of  reclaimed  land,
which  the  altered  limits  of  the  port  has  been  said  to
impinge upon, has no legs to stand, in view of the fact
that no prior permission has been taken under Section 35
of the Gujarat Maritime Board Act to add reclaimed land
to the main land, as has been stated hereinabove.  Added
to this, the area of 195 hectares that has been reclaimed
is allocated to the Appellants for their own use – 140
hectares immediately and the balance only after approval
and construction of the further elongated jetty.  It is clear
that even if the Appellants’ plea were to be accepted, the
42alteration of the limits of the port cannot possibly be said
to affect the Appellants’ rights qua reclaimed land, which
has been reclaimed illegally i.e. without prior permission
under the Gujarat Maritime Board Act.  Thus, the CRZ
clearance  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests
dated 6th May, 2014 for reclamation of 334 hectares of
land does not further the Appellants’ case in any way.
23.We now come to the Appellants’ argument of the
haste that is shown by the GMB in recommending the
second proposal for altered limits.   True, the GMB did act
within 4 days of the said proposal, but this fact, without
anything more, to demonstrate mala fides or lack of public
interest, cannot possibly hold water.  It is also to be noted
that Shri Salve’s plea, that 13 berths would require 1011
hectares of adjacent land and that much less land than
1011  hectares  has  been  allocated  for  the  use  of  a
commercial port, has to be accepted.   
4324.The further plea, that the forest land to the north
consisting of 300 hectares, having now been acquired in
October, 2016, would enure to the benefit of HPPL, would
also not take the Appellants’ case any further, as even
these  300  hectares  would  be  subsumed  within  the
requirement of 1011 hectares, as has been pointed out, in
the DPR of 2010.
25.There can be no doubt that Shri Joshi’s plea that
the power of the Government to alter the limits of any port
under Section 5(1) of the Indian Ports Act must be done
only in public interest is correct.  However, it has not been
shown  to  us  as  to  how  the  impugned  notification  is
contrary to public interest.  The affidavits filed in the High
Court, by the State Government and the GMB, show that
a commercial port’s limits were altered in public interest
because  the  number  of  vessels  at  Hazira  port  were
expected to increase dramatically and it was, therefore,
necessary  to  make  adequate  facilities  not  only  for
44anchorage  of  such  vessels,  but  also  for  reasons  of
customs formalities, port conversion, general security etc.
We are not, therefore, satisfied that the notification is ultra
vires Section 5 of the Indian Ports Act.  We have already
seen that the Appellants have no ‘right’ to private property
in view of the fact that the ownership of the captive jetty
that has been constructed and the ownership of reclaimed
land is with the GMB/State Government.  For this reason
also, the notification is intra vires as the alteration in the
limits  of  Hazira  Port  does  not  affect  any  ‘right’ of  the
Appellants to private property. 
26.In conclusion, for the reasons given by us in the
present judgment, the appeal deserves to be dismissed.
The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1682 OF 2012
 Ramesh Dasu Chauhan and Another ..... APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
The State of Maharashtra .....RESPONDENT(S)
JUDGMENT
SURYA KANT, J.
The Sessions Judge, Nagpur vide judgment and order dated 26th
February, 2003 convicted the appellants under Section 302 read with
Section  34  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (for  brevity,  “the  I.P.C.”)  and
sentenced to undergo life imprisonment besides a fine of Rs.1,500/-
each and in default thereof they were directed to undergo Rigorous
Imprisonment  for  six  months.   They  were  further  convicted  under
Section 392 read with Section 34, I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo
Rigorous Imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-
each and in default thereof they were directed to undergo Rigorous
Imprisonment for three months.
12.The appellants’ conviction and sentence was upheld by a Division
Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench in
Criminal Appeal No. 272/2003, decided on 11.04.2008.  Both these
judgments are under challenge in this 2nd Appeal.
BRIEF FACTS: 
3.Deceased Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi, aged about 79 years used to
reside  along  with  her  daughter  Rani  Trivedi  and  grand  daughter
Purnima Trivedi in Rajnigandha Apartments, Ambazari, Nagpur.  Rani
Trivedi was a school teacher and used to leave home for her work
around 7.20 a.m. and return back in the evening.  Purnima Trivedi was
studying in M.A. in a college and she too used to leave for her classes
at  about  10.00  a.m.  and  return  by  afternoon.   Deceased  Kamlesh
Kumari Trivedi, thus, would remain alone in the house during the afore
stated period.
4.On the fateful day, i.e., 28th August, 2001, both Rani Trivedi and
Purnima  Trivedi  left  for  their  respective  destinations  while  Kamlesh
Kumari Trivedi was all by herself in the house. When Purnima Trivedi
returned from College around 1.30 p.m., she found her grandmother
(Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi) lying dead in the drawing room with visible
signs of strangulation.  The Onida T.V. set kept in the drawing room
was  found  missing.  Purnima  Trivedi  immediately  rushed  to  her
2neighbours  Raisaheb  Chourasiya  and  Baliram  Fulari  and  informed
them about the incident. Both of them accompanied Purnima to the
apartment.  Baliram Fulari, on the request of Chourasiya, informed the
police control room about the incident.
5.Raisaheb Chourasiya, noticed on the date of occurrence that two
young boys had come on a red coloured motorcycle; stopped it in front
of Rajnigandha Apartments; entered the apartment building and after
some time vanished from the spot.  Mr. Sevakram Thaokar, Inspector of
Crime Branch, Nagpur rushed to the spot and on the basis of the
information  divulged  by  the  neighbours,  he  carried  out  search
operations and apprehended the appellants from near the Gupta Hotel
in village Hingna.  On personal search of one of the suspect, some
cash amount and a silver coin was recovered; their motor cycle was
seized and Onida T.V. was also then got recovered at the instance of
first  appellant  (Ramesh).   Crime  No.  246/2001  under  Section  302,
392/34 was registered.  On consideration of the chargesheet, charges
under Sections 302, 392/34, I.P.C. were framed to which the appellants
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
6.The prosecution, in all, examined eleven witnesses to establish
the charge, but none by the defence.  The appellants in their statement
under  Section  313,  Cr.PC,  as  well  as  in  the  cross-examination  of
3prosecution witnesses, pleaded absolute denial and claimed to have
been made a scapegoat by the police in order to cool the public rage
down against the heinous crime.
7.Three points fell for consideration of the Learned Sessions Judge,
namely,
(i) Whether  deceased  Kamlesh  Kumari  Trivedi  died  homicidal
death?
(ii) Whether the prosecution was able to prove that accused Nos. 1
and 2 in furtherance of their common intention committed murder
of Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi?
(iii)Whether the prosecution had further succeeded in proving that
accused Nos. 1 and 2, in furtherance of their common intention,
committed robbery of taking away Onida T.V., silver coin and
cash amount of Rs.200/- from the custody of deceased Kamlesh
Kumari Trivedi?
8.    The Trial Court was alive to the situation that in order to prove a
criminal charge by means of circumstantial evidence, it was imperative
on  the  prosecution  to  establish  beyond  any  doubt  that  –  (i)  the
circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn must
be fully established; (ii) the facts so established should be consistent
4only  with  the  hypothesis  of  the  guilt  of  the  accused;  (iii)  the
circumstances should be of conclusive nature and they should exclude
any possible hypothesis except the one to be proved; and (iv) the chain
of evidence should be complete leaving no reasonable ground for the
conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused.
9.The Trial Court thereafter scrutinised the entire evidence within
the  framework  of  cited  parameters  and  after  an  elaborate
confabulation, it came to the conclusion that Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi
died  a  homicidal  death;  the  appellants  were  duly  seen  entering
Rajnigandha  Apartments  at  the  most  relevant  time  by  Raisaheb
Chourasiya (P.W.9), the recovery of Onida T.V., silver coin and a part of
currency from the appellants was also a strong circumstance to nail
them,  who  were  consequently  held  guilty  of  the  offence(s)  under
Sections 302 and 392 read with Section 34 of the I.P.C. and sentenced
accordingly. 
10. The High Court re-evaluated the prosecution evidence in its entirety
and  banking  upon  the  statement  of  the  star  witness,  Raisaheb
Chourasiya (P.W.9) coupled with the deposition made by Sevakram
Thaokar, Police Inspector, Crime Branch (P.W.11), it concurred with the
Trial Court and dimissed the appeal.
11.We  have heard  Mr. Ekansh Bansal,  Learned Counsel  for the
5appellants and Mr. Nishant R. Katneshwarkar, Learned Counsel on
behalf of the State and gone through the record with their assistance.
12.It  was  vehemently  urged  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  that  no
Identification Test Parade was conducted before the Court to establish
the presence of appellants at the place of crime, even though the star
prosecution witness, Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9) has acknowleged
that the two young persons who came on the red coloured motorcycle
had  covered  their  faces  with  mufflers.  The  version  of  Raisaheb
Chourasiya (P.W.9) was sought to be discredited on the plea that the
appellants being in the age group of 30s, could not be roped in as
young boys of 20-25 who were allegedly noticed entering Rajnigandha
Apartments around the time when the occurrence took place.  Learned
Counsel further argued that the appellants were never confronted with
the alleged stolen items for identification, more so when the panch
witnesses of alleged recovery have resiled and declared hostile.  He
thus, urged that crucial links in the formation of chain of circumstantial
evidence are conspicuously missing so as to link the appellants with
the offence.  The prosecution has, therefore, failed to establish its case
beyond reasonable doubt.  Counsel for the State contrarily, maintained
that its a proven case against the appellants and this Court need not re-
appraise the concurrent findings returned by the two Courts.
613.We find that the question which falls for consideration of this
Court is whether the circumstantial evidence led in the instant case is
so unimpeachable that it establishes the guilt of the appellants beyond
the shadow of doubt.
14.The expression `circumstantial evidence’ has been the subject
matter of consideration in a catena of decisions wherein it has been
precisely defined as a combination of such facts that there is no escape
for the accused because the facts taken as a whole do not admit to any
inference but of his guilt.  It has also been coined as a Complete Chain
Link  Theory,  putting  onus  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  beyond
reasonable  doubt,  the  chain  of  events  which  lead  to  only  one
conclusion, namely, the culpability of the accused.
15.This Court in  Sharad Birdhi Chand  Sharda v. The State of
Maharashtra1  elaborately  considered  the  standard  of  proof
necessitated for recording a conviction on the basis of circumstantial
evidence and laid down the five golden principles of standard of proof
required to be established in such a case, which are paraphrased as
follows:-
i)The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be
drawn should be fully established;
1(1984) 4 SCC 116
7ii)The  facts  so  established  should  be  consistent  only  with  the
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, these should
not  be  explainable  on  any  other  hypothesis  except  that  the
accused is guilty;
iii)The circumstances should be conclusive in nature and tendency;
iv)They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to
be proved; and
v)There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave
any  reasonable ground for the  conclusion consistent with the
innocence  of  the  accused  and  must  show  that  in  all  human
probability the acts must have been committed by the accused.
16.These precepts have been unvaryingly reiterated by this Court
from  time  to  time  including  recently  in  Manoj  Kumar  v.  State  of
Uttarakhand2.
17. Let us now examine whether the prosecution has successfully
established these well-known parameters in the case in hand?
18.The  prosecution  case  foremostly  hinges  upon  the  version  of
Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9).  He earlier made a statement under
Section 164, Cr.PC on 16.10.2001 and consistent with thereto he has
2(2019) 5 SCC 663
8unequivocally deposed that on 28.08.2001 at around 11.45 a.m., he
was drying his hair in his apartment when two boys came on a red
coloured motorcycle of Hero Honda make, which they parked in front of
his  neighbour  Nag  Devi’s  apartment.   The  two  boys  went  in  the
direction of Plot No. 94-95 and he thought that they might have come to
see the house which was under construction.  He, however, noticed
that the two boys opened the front gate of Rajnigandha Apartments and
went inside.  Meanwhile, Raisaheb Chourasiya got a call on phone and
after attending to it for about 20 minutes, when he again looked for the
Hero Honda Motorcycle, it was not there.  Both the boys were in plain
apparels and had put mufflers on their faces.  He thereafter went to see
one of the neighbours and sat in the verandah of the later’s house.
After some time, Purnima Trivedi came crying and informed that her
grandmother was not speaking and she was lying in a pool of blood.
She also informed that someone had stolen their T.V. set.  P.W.9 along
with Purnima and one Baliram Fulari went inside the apartment and
found that the grandmother of Purnima was lying dead and blood was
oozing out of her nose.  He asked Purnima not to touch anything and
let  the  police  come  and  make  the  enquiry.   He  then  asked  his
neighbour, Baliram Fulari to inform the police about the incident. On the
same day at about 5.30 p.m., the police brought the two boys with the
9motorcycle  to  his  house  and  he  identified  them  as  well  as  the
motorcycle, for there were five stickers of `sindoor’ on the mudguard of
the  motorcycle  and  he  also  remembered  its  Registration  Number.
Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9) identified both the boys in Court-room
also, namely, the appellants.  Pertinently, there is not even a suggestion
to the witness in his cross-examination that he was not present in his
apartment  or  that  he  did  not  see  the  appellants  entering  the
Rajnigandha Apartments.  The only question put to the witness was
apparently to remind him that he could not recognize the boys as they
had  covered  their  faces  with  mufflers,  which  he  has  categorically
denied.  The witness very emphatically says in his cross-examination
that, “Incorrect to state that I have idedntified the accused except they
are before the Court”.  The defence has indeed miserably failed to
cause any dent in the veracity or the capability of the witness to identify
the two boys who came on the motorcycle and entered the front gate of
Rajnigandha Apartments or his assertion that those two boys were
none else than the appellants.
19.Baliram  Fulari  (P.W.3)  has  testified  that  on  28th August,  2001
around 1.30 p.m. one of his neighbours Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9)
came to his house and informed about the murder of the mother of
Rani Trivedi (P.W.1) and the theft of some articles.  Purnima Trivedi
10(P.W.4) was also accompanying Raisaheb Chourasiya.  He informed
the  police  about  the  incident  on  the  request  made  by  Raisaheb
Chourasiya  and  also  gave  registered  number  of  the  red  coloured
motorcycle  to  the  police.   Baliram  Fulari  (P.W.3)  has  specifically
deposed that he informed Shri Kangle, D.C.P. of Crime Branch about
the incident.  The only suggestion given in the cross-examination to
Baliram Fulari, (P.W.3) is that no information was passed on to him
either by Raisaheb Chourasiya or Purnima Trivedi.  As against it, the
witness has further clarified in his cross-examination that on the same
day at about 5.30 p.m., the police brought the suspects to the place of
incident.   He  thus  fully  corroborates  the  testimony  of  Raisaheb
Chourasiya (P.W.9) and Purnima Trivedi (P.W.4) to the extent that the
police brought two boys at the place of occurrence and both of them
were seen by P.W.1, P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.9.     
20.According to Rani Trivedi (P.W.1), she got an emergency phone
call from her daughter around 2.30 p.m. about her mother having been
assaulted and the incident of theft in their house. She immediately left
for home and saw the bloodstains on the floor; that her mother was
throttled and strangulated with her own sari and the police was present
on the scene.  She found that the cupboards in the room of their
apartment were broken and the items were scattered.  A silver coin of
11`Goddess Lakshmi’ along with cash amount of Rs.200/- besides Onida
T.V. were missing.  The thieves, however, could not break open the
Godrej almirah in which valuables were kept.  She has indubitably
deposed that the police brought two persons in the evening to their flat
and she identified them who were present in Court as accused Nos. 1
and 2. Her statement too is totally unruffled in the cross-examination.
Rather, she has well-explained that Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9) lives
in the third house in row from her house.
21.Purnima  Trivedi  (P.W.4),  grand  daughter  of  the  deceased
chronically  narrated  the  events which  she  saw after  returning from
college at about 1.15 p.m.  She has deposed that on reaching the flat,
she kept ringing the bell but got no response, therefore, she tried to
open the main door and pushed it due to which the pelmet fell down.
She found on entering the flat that her grandmother was lying in a pool
of blood in the drawing room.  She sprinkled water on her face thinking
she might be alive.  While she was looking around she found that
Onida T.V. was missing.  She found that cash amount of Rs.200/- and a
silver coin were also missing from the cubboard.  She immediately ran
to  inform  her  neighbours  and  rushed  to  the  house  of  Raisaheb
Chourasiya (P.W.9), who stayed two houses away from their apartment.
She told him about the incident.  No meaningful question was asked to
12her  in  the  cross-examination  to  indicate  any  overcolouring  in  her
version.
22.We  may  now  turn  to  the  statement  of  Sevakram  Thaokar
(P.W.11), the Investigating Officer-cum-Inspector of Crime Branch.  He
along with the staff immediately reached at the spot i.e. Rajnigandha
Apartments  on receipt of  the wireless  message  and  learnt  through
Raisaheb  Chourasiya  (P.W.9)  about  two  persons  coming  on  a  red
coloured motorcycle.  He started searching for the suspects without any
loss of time and reached upto village Hingna where he found a red
coloured motorcycle in front of Gupta Hotel. There were two persons
with the motorcycle, who were brought to Gupta Hotel and he called
two Panchas so as to interrogate the suspects in their presence.  The
two suspects, namely, the appellants were eventually arrested and a
sum of Rs.231/- and one HMT wrist watch was seized from appellant
No. 1 (Ramesh).  Another sum of Rs. 142/- with silver coin and one
goggle was recovered from appellant  No. 2 (Kamlesh).  Their Hero
Honda Motorcycle was seized vide Ext. P-27.  Appellant No. 1 also got
recovered Onida T.V. from his residence at Wana Dongri vide recovery
Ext. P-25.
23.As per the post mortem report of Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi, the
medical  officer  found  following  four  ante-mortem  wounds  given  in
13Column 17 of the medical legal report Ext. P-17:-
“1. Ligature mark present over front of neck, below thyroid
cartilage, transversely placed.  Completely encircling the
neck except over nape of neck at the site of plait, on both
side of neck ligature marked 6 cms below tip of both
mastoid  processes,  length  of  ligature  mark  30  Cms,
breadth, 2.5 cm. slightly grooved, dry hard.
2. Contused abrasion present over posterior aspect of
right forearms 2 cm x 2 cm. reddish brown,
3. Contused abrasion present over left side of neck, 2 cm
below left angle of mandible 4 cm away from middle,
obliquely placed 2 cm. x 1 cm. Reddish Brown.
4. Contused abrasion present over left side of neck, 2 cm.
Lateral to injury No. 3 size 1 cm x 1 cm reddish brown.”
24.The medical officer unambiguously opined that injury No. 1 of
Column 17 along with internal damage was sufficient to cause death of
the victim in the ordinary course of nature.  The cause of death was
`Asphyxia’ i.e. due to ligature strangulation.
25.From the nature of ante-mortem injuries suffered by the deceased
as described in the inquest panchnama Ext. P-12 read with the post
mortem report, it can be safely believed that the death was `homicidal’
within the meaning of Section 299 I.P.C.  The medical evidence in this
regard is fully corroborated by the statement of Rani Trivedi (P.W.1),
Baliram  Fulari  (P.W.3),  Purnima  Trivedi  (P.W.4)  and  Raisaheb
Chourasiya  (P.W.9)  and  thus  there  is  no  room  for  doubt  that  the
deceased Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi died a homicidal death.
1426.There  is  clinching  evidence  on  record  to  establish  that  the
appellants were seen around 11.45 a.m. entering the front gate of
Rajnigandha Apartments where the deceased was residing.  They left
the place after 20 minutes or so.  As per the eye-witness’s account the
appellants were lastly seen nearest to the place of occurrence before
they disappeared.
27.There is no gainsaying that confession made to a police officer
cannot be proved as against a person accused of any offence and no
confession made by a person while in police custody except made in
the immediate presence of a Magistrate, can be proved against him in
view of embargo created by Sections 25 and  26 of the Evidence Act.
Section  27  of  the  Act  nevertheless  carves  out  an  exception  as  it
provides  that  when  any  fact  is  deposed  to  as  discovered  in
consequence of information received from a person accused of any
offence while he is in police custody, “so much of such information”,
regardless of it being a confession or not, may be proved,  if it relates
distinctly to the fact thereby discovered.  Section 27 of the Evidence Act
thus enables the cliched use of a custodian statement made in the
ordinary course of events.  The statement made by an accused while in
police custody can be split in two parts and to the extent of it being a
disclosure statement which is the immediate cause of discovering new
15facts, would be legally admissible in evidence though the remainder of
such  statement  may  be  liable  to  be  discarded.   The  Investigating
Officer, Sevakram Thaokar (P.W.11) has very emphatically deposed
that out of the stolen items, Onida T.V. set was got recovered at the
instance of the first appellant from his house.  Similarly, the silver coin
and  a  part  of  the  stolen  currency  was  recovered  from  the  second
appellant. This is not the appellants’ case that they were forced to make
the incriminating statements under any threat.  They have chosen to
defend themselves only on the basis of denial.  The revelation made by
the Investigating Officer to the limited extent of recovery of the stolen
items pursuant to the disclosure statements made by the appellants,
therefore, falls within the four-corners of Section 27 of the Evidence Act
and has been rightly relied upon by the Courts below.      
28.True  it  is  that  the  statement  of  a  police  officer  has  to  be
scrupulously  scrutinised  and  the  Court  would  cautiously  and
suspiciously read the same for evaluating the cumulative effect of the
entire evidence on record.  If the statement of PW-11 is scanned in its
entirety, it stands out that no sooner Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9) gave
the description of two young persons who came on a red coloured
motorcycle  or  their  entry  into  Rajnigandha  Apartments,  the  police
inspector swung into action and apprehended them within no loss of
16time.  The two persons, namely, the appellants were brought back to
Rajnigandha Apartments and they were duly identified by Raisaheb
Chourasiya (P.W.9).  Baliram Fulari (P.W.3) and Rani Trivedi (P.W.1)
also saw and later on identified them in their depositions.  Since the
appellants have not disputed their identity in the cross-examination of
Raisaheb Chourasiya (P.W.9) or of Rani Trivedi (P.W.1), it is too late for
them to allege that no Test Identification Parade was conducted.
29.It is no longer debatable that the Identification Parade of the
accused before the Court is not the main substantive piece of evidence,
rather it is corroborative in nature.  [Please see: (i)  Rafikul Alam v.
State of West Bengal  (2007) SCC Online Cal. 728 or (2008) 1 CHN
685; (ii) Navaneethakrishnan v. State by Inspector of Police  (2018)
16 SCC 161].
30.There  are  more  than  one  reasons  to  trust  P.W.9  (Raisaheb
Chourasyia).  Firstly, there is no suggestion or even a whisper of any
animosity between Raisaheb Chourasyia and the appellants.  He had
no motive to falsely implicate the appellants.  Secondly, the presence of
the appellants coming on red coloured motorcycle and their entry to
Rajnigandha  Apartments,  as  seen   by  the  witness,  has  not  been
expressly  denied  in  his  cross-examination.   Thirdly,  P.W.9  being
resident of the same Complex, is a natural and not a `chance’ witness.
17Fourthly, Raisaheb Chourasiya’s version has been fully corroborated by
the other prosecution witnesses like Rani Trivedi (P.W.1), Baliram Fulari
(P.W.3)  and  Purnima  Trivedi  (P.W.4).   Fifthly,  he  is  consistent
throughout, be it may his statement under Section 164, Cr.PC and/or
deposition  on  oath.  Sixthly,  the  attempt  made  on  the  character
assassination of the witness has miserably failed.  We thus find no
ground to suspect P.W.9 for non-existent reasons.
31.The appellants, in all probabilities, were present in Rajnigandha
Apartments at the time of occurrence.  They have failed to explain any
other reason of their presence.  They have also not questioned their
identity  by  Raisaheb  Chourasiya  (P.W.9)  and  Rani  Trivedi  (P.W.1).
They have not doubted or condemned the police officer (P.W.11) of
falsely planting any recovery on them.  Further, all the stolen items
recovered at the instance of the appellants have been duly identified by
Rani Trivedi (P.W.1) and Purnima Trivedi (P.W.4) as their belongings
and thus the link between the crime and the recovered items has been
conclusively established.  The appellants having been lastly seen near
the scene of crime, their complete silence and/or evasive statement
under Section 313, Cr.PC, does not inspire confidence to discard the
prosecution case.
32.Both the Courts below have weighed the evidence to reach a
18definite conclusion that the appellants and the appellants alone entered
the apartment of Kamlesh Kumari Trivedi and committed her murder by
strangulation with a motive to commit robbery in the house.  There is no
factual or legal infirmity in the findings returned by the Courts below,
which  may  call  for  any  interference  by  this  Court.   The  Appeal  is
accordingly dismissed.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL No.8938 OF 2011
Bir Wati & Ors. ….Appellant(s)
VERSUS
Union of India & Anr.        …Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1)This appeal is filed against the final judgment
and  order  dated 09.03.2006  passed  by  the  High
Court  of  Delhi  at  New  Delhi  in  L.A.  Appeal
Nos.587-589  of  2005  at  Chandigarh  in  C.R.  No.
3823 of 2005 whereby the High Court dismissed the
appeal filed by the appellants herein affirming the
order dated 21.04.2005 of the Additional District
Judge, Delhi in L.A.C. No.21 of 2000 dismissing the
reference petition filed by  the appellants-claimants
1under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  as  barred  by
limitation.
2)The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass.
They, however, need mention in brief to appreciate
the short controversy involved in the appeal.
3)The appellants are legal representatives of one
Jugal  Kishore.  On  06.04.1964,  the  appropriate
Government  (Delhi)  issued  a  notification  under
Section  4  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894
(hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") for acquiring a
huge track of land in nearby areas of Delhi. The
acquisition was for a public purpose, viz., ""planned
development of the area"". 
4)It was followed by the declaration issued under
Section  6  of  the  Act  on  15.06.1965  followed  by
issuance of notices under Sections 9 and 10 of the
Act to all the interested persons whose lands were
acquired  pursuant  to  the  aforementioned
notifications. The Land Acquisition Officer passed
2the  award  (award  No.  1934-C/Suppl/80-81)  on
06.02.1981.  In  the  award,  the  Land  Acquisition
Officer (LAO) fixed the rate at Rs.20/25 per square
yard=Rs.2250/-  per  Bigha  for  paying  the
compensation to the landowners for their land.
5)The land belonging to Jugal Kishore was also
acquired in these acquisition proceedings along with
other lands. Jugal Kishore, unfortunately, expired
pending these proceedings leaving behind his legal
representatives  (appellants  herein).  So  far  as  the
present  appellants  are  concerned,  they  were  not
aware of the passing of the award because they were
neither present when the award was passed and nor
were  served  with  the  notice  of  the  award  under
Section 12(2) of the Act and nor did they receive any
notice in the name of Late Jugal Kishore.
6)It was for this reason that though the award
was passed way back on 06.02.1981, the appellants
received  the  compensation  pursuant  to  the  said
3award on  13.04.1998 almost  after 18 years. The
appellants  then  on  16.5.1998  applied  to  the
Collector under Section 18 (2) of the Act and prayed
therein for making a reference to the Civil Court for
re-determination  of  the  compensation  determined
by the LAO. The Collector forwarded this application
to the District Judge, New Delhi. It was registered
as L.A.C No. 21/2000.
7)The Additional District Judge, by order dated
21.4.2005  dismissed  the  reference  as  barred  by
time. Since the reference was dismissed as being
barred by limitation, the merits of the case were not
gone  into.  The  appellants  carried  the  matter  in
appeal to the High Court under Section 54 of the
Act.  The  High  Court,  by  impugned  judgment,
dismissed the appeal and upheld the order of the
Additional District Judge. In the opinion of the High
Court also, the reference made by the appellants
was  barred  by  limitation  as  prescribed  under
4Section 18 and was thus rightly dismissed by the
Civil  Court.  Against  this  order,  the  appellants
(landowners) felt aggrieved and filed the appeal by
way of special leave petition in this Court.
8)As  stated  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the
appellants, several other landowners whose lands
were also acquired along with the appellants’ land
pursuant to Section 4 and 6 notifications referred
supra, had filed reference application to the Civil
Court against the award dated 06.02.1981.  The
Civil  Court  by  award  re-determined  the
compensation and enhanced it to Rs.12,000/- per
Bigha. It was stated that the Government accepted
the award of the reference Court (Civil Court) and
paid  the  enhanced  compensation  to  those
landowners.
9)Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case,  we
5are  inclined  to  dispose  of  the  appeal  with  the
following observations and directions:
10)In Union of India & Anr.  Vs. Hansoli Devi &
Ors., (2002) 7 SCC 273, a two Judge Bench of this
Court referred three specific questions to the larger
Bench  of  Five  Judges  for  answer.  These  three
questions read as under:
 “1. (a) Whether dismissal of an application
seeking reference under Section 18 on the
ground  of  delay  amounts  to  ‘not  filing  an
application’  within the meaning of  Section
28-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894?
(b) Whether a person whose application under
Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
is dismissed on the ground of delay or any
other  technical  ground  is  entitled  to
maintain an application under Section 28-A
of the Land Acquisition Act?
2. Whether a person who has received the
compensation  without  protest  pursuant  to
the award of the Land Acquisition Collector
and  has  not  filed  an  application  seeking
reference  under  Section  18  is  ‘a  person
aggrieved’  within  the  meaning  of  Section
28-A?”
611)So far as question 1 (b) with which we are
concerned here, it was answered in Para 10 which
reads as under:
“10. So far as Question 1( b) is concerned, this
is really the same question, as in Question
1(a) and, therefore, we reiterate that when an
application of a landowner under Section 18
is dismissed on the ground of delay, then the
said  landowner  is  entitled  to  make  an
application  under  Section  28-A,  if  other
conditions prescribed therein are fulfilled.”
12)   In the light of aforesaid law laid down by this
Court,  one  cannot  dispute  that  so  far  as  the
appellants  are  concerned,  notwithstanding
dismissal  of  their  reference  application  as  being
barred by limitation by the reference Court and the
High Court, they still have a right to apply under
Section  28-A  of  the  Act  to  the  Collector  for
re-determination  of  the  compensation  payable  to
them on the basis of the compensation awarded by
the  reference  Court  to  other  similarly  situated
7landowners whose land was acquired along with the
appellants’ land.
13)It is true that one of the requirements to apply
to the Collector under Section 28-A of the Act is to
make an application within three months from the
date of the award passed in other cases. 
14)In  this  case,  three  months  have  already
expired and the appellants were not able to make
the application within three months or thereafter till
date.  However, having regard to the peculiar facts
and circumstances of the case wherein we find that
firstly, the  bread earner of the appellants’ family
namely Jugal Kishore died during the pendency of
the  proceedings  before  the  Collector  long  back;
secondly, one of the appellants  also expired during
pendency of this appeal as reported; and thirdly, all
the  appellants are illiterates and unaware  of the
proceedings in question for years even after passing
of the award and are also unaware of the legal and
8procedural requirements prescribed in the Act.  It is
due to these reasons, we are of the view that the
appellants are entitled for indulgence.
15)In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are
of  the  view  that  this  is  a  fit  case  to  allow  the
appellants to make an application to the concerned
Collector under Section 28-A of the Act within three
months from the date of receipt of this judgment i.e.
on  or  before  17.12.2017  praying  therein  for
payment of compensation to them in the light of the
enhanced compensation, if already found awarded
to  other  landowners  in  these  very  acquisition
proceedings by the reference Court.
16)This indulgence to apply under Section 28-A of
the Act is granted to the appellants by this Court in
exercise of our powers conferred under Article 142
of the Constitution which we do with a view to do
complete and substantial justice to the appellants.
917)Let the Collector entertain the application, if
made by the appellants within three months from
the date of the order under Section 28-A of the Act
and hold an inquiry as contemplated under Section
28-A of the Act for determining the compensation, if
found  payable  to  the  appellants  under  the  Act.
However, the appellants would not in such a case be
entitled to claim any interest of any nature due to
delay on their part. The Collector shall decide the
application  once  made  by  the  appellants  within
three  months  and  release  the  payment  of
compensation as directed hereinabove in favour of
appellants  after  making  proper  verification  about
their family relations with the original claimant etc.
18) With  these  directions,  the  appeal  stands
disposed of finally with no order as cost.

Note:
1.  The  minimum  rates  of  wages  being  fixed/
revised  are  linked  with  Haryana  State  Working
Consumer Price Index Number (base year 1972-
73=100) with July 2007 as the base month.  The
rate of neutralization will be Rs.2.31 per point on
the  rise  or  fall  of  the  Consumer  Price  Index
Number, adjustment in wages shall be made six
monthly i.e. 1st January and 1st July, every year
after taking into account the average rise or fall in
the Haryana State Working Class Consumer Price
Index Number half-yearly ending December and
June respectively.  
2. The minimum rates of wages being now fixed/
revised shall not be affected as a result of the
linkage as much as the wages shall not fall below
those being fixed/ revised now.
3 The wages of apprentices appointed under the
Apprentices  Act,  1961  (52  of  1961),  shall  be
regulated under the said Act. 
4. There shall be no difference between the wages
for men and women workers.

43.The above Appeal was taken up along with the other
Writ Petitions which were filed for the same relief.  Without
a detailed discussion on the issues which arose in the Writ
Petition,  the High  Court  dismissed  the Writ  Petition  by
observing that the contention raised by the Petitioners
regarding the impermissibility of classification of workmen
was misconceived and that the trainees would fall within
the purview of the Act.  
Civil Appeal No. _______   of 2019 
(Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 5832 of
2018)

made six monthly i.e. on 1st January and 1st July
every year, after taking into account the average
rise  or  fall in  the  Haryana  State  Working  Class
Consumer  Price  Index  half  yearly  ending
December and June respectively.  
2. The minimum rates of wages now being fixed/
revised shall not be affected as a result of the
linkage as much as the wages shall not fall below
those being fixed/ revised now.  
3. The wages of apprentices appointed under the
Apprentices  Act,  1961  (52  of  1961),  shall  be
regulated under the said Act.  
4. There shall be no difference between the wages
for men and women. 
75. Where any of the above categories of workmen
are engaged/ employed through a contractor, the
occupier/  the  principal  employer  shall  be
personally responsible for ensuring the payment
of the minimum rates of wages by the contractor. 
6.  If  any  category  of  workers  employed  in  the
employment  is  not  mentioned  specifically  by
name,  he/she  shall  not  be  paid  less  than  the
minimum wages fixed for similar category having
same skills.  
7.  While  calculating  the  per  day  wages,  the
monthly wages shall be divided by 26 days but for
deduction, if any, shall be calculated as monthly
wages divided by 30 days. 
8. The categorization of employment in Brik Kiln is
placed above at Annexure-A.
9.  Above  rates  do  not  include  food  charges.
Wherever  food  is  given  customarily,  it  shall  be
extra.
10.  Trainees  shall  be  paid  75%  of  the  wages
applicable to the category, but it shall not be less
8than the Minimum Wages for an unskilled category
of worker because an unskilled worker does not
require any training.  The period of training shall
not be more than one year. 
6.It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant before
the  High  Court  that  the  segregation  of  wages  into
components in the form of allowances was permissible.
The further contention of the Appellant before the High
Court was that Note 10 of the Notification which fixed the
minimum  wages  for  trainees  at  75%  of  the  wages
applicable to that category and also limited period of such
training  to  one  year  was  ultra  vires the  Act.
The provision for categorization of unskilled employees as
semi-skilled  on  their  acquiring  experience  of  a  certain
number of years was stated to be beyond the jurisdiction
of the Government.  Inclusion of Domestic Workers and
Safai Karamcharis in the list of scheduled employments at
Serial Numbers 49 and 50 was also in challenge in the
Writ Petition.  The High Court rejected the submission of
the Appellants that there is prohibition of segregation of
wages into components in the form of allowances. The
9challenge to 100% neutralization was also not accepted
by the High Court.  The Act was held to be applicable to
the trainees by the impugned judgment.  Insofar as the
categorization of workers was concerned, the High Court
was of the opinion that the categorization was justified
and indeed necessary as the workmen were continued in
their grades for a long number of years which resulted in
stagnation.   The  contention  of  the  Appellants  that
Domestic Workers and Safai Karamcharis could not have
been  included  in  the  list  of  scheduled  employment  at
Serial  Numbers  49  and  50  was  accepted  by  the  High
Court.  In view of the aforesaid findings, the High Court
concluded that Notes 1, 9 and 10 of the Notification dated
21.10.2015 were legal and valid.  It is relevant to mention
that the High Court relied upon the judgment of a Division
Bench in Writ Petition (Civil) No.11326 of 20071 in support
of its findings.  
7.Mr. Kailash Vasdev, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for  the  Appellants  in  Civil  Appeal  No.  2539  of  2010
submitted  that  the  classification  of  workmen  by  the
1 Apparel Exporters & Manufacturers Association vs. State of Haryana – CWP 
No.9942 of 2007 dated 06.09.2007
10Notification dated 27.06.2007 amounts to an interference
with the promotion policy of the Appellant which is beyond
the  jurisdiction  of the Government under  the  Act.   He
stated that the Government does not have the power to
alter  the  conditions  of  service,  contract  or  settlement
between the employer and the employee.  He referred to
a settlement between employees and the employer which
specifies the regulation of wages.  Mr. Vasdev argued that
the  High  Court  erred  in  not  realizing  the  difference
between a fair wage, a living wage, and a minimum wage.
He relied upon a judgment of this Court in  Bidi, Bidi
Leaves and Tobacco Merchants’ Association  v. State
of Bombay2  in support of his submission that the power
that is conferred on the Government was only to deal with
fixation and revision of wages and not to interfere with the
contractual rights and obligations.  Mr. Harvinder Singh,
learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner in Civil Appeal
@  SLP  (Civil)  No.5832  of  2018  submitted  that  the
Petitioner has a grievance only regarding some portions of
the Notification dated 21.10.2015.  His first objection to
the Notification was relating to the revision of minimum
2 1962 Supp (1) SCR 381
11rates  of  wages  for  Security  inspector/  Security  officer/
Supervisor by relying upon the definition of “employee” in
Section  2(i)  of  the  Act.  He  submitted  that  Security
inspector/ Security officer/ Supervisors will not fall within
the  purview  of  the  definition  and  hence,  the  State
Government did not have  the power  to  fix/ revise the
minimum wages for the said categories.  Similarly, the
learned  counsel  submitted  that  trainees  cannot  be
brought within the purview of the Act as they also do not
fall within the definition of “employee” under Section 2(i)
of the Act as all the trainees are not employed for hire or
reward.  The learned counsel relied upon a judgment of
this  Court  in  Haryana  Unrecognised  Schools’
Association  v.  State of Haryana3 in which it was held
that teachers working in an educational institution cannot
be held to be discharging either skilled or unskilled or
manual  or  clerical  work  and  as  such  they  did  not  fall
within the scope of “employee” under Section 2(i) of the
Act.  Mr. Singh submitted that the Government did not
have the power to place a restriction on the period of
training  which  according  to  the  Notification  cannot  be
3 (1996) 4 SCC 225
12more  than  one  year.   He  further  argued  that  the
classification of employees was totally impermissible.  He
also  submitted  that  different  minimum  rates  of  wages
cannot be fixed for the same class of work in the same
scheduled employment.  By the deemed categorization of
an unskilled employee as a semi-skilled employee after
five  years  experience,  the  Government  fixed  higher
minimum  rate of wages for a worker who has completed
five years though he continued to work as an unskilled
employee.  This would amount to higher minimum wages
being paid for a worker in the lower category on the basis
of deemed classification.  He further submitted that the
prohibition of segregation of wages into components in
the form of allowances was beyond the competence of the
Government.  By referring to Section 2(h) of the Act which
defines  wages,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant
submitted  that  the  very  definition  of  wages  means  all
other  remuneration  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of
contract or employment.  According to Mr. Singh, there is
no concept of basic rate of minimum wages.  He further
argued  that  the  concept  of  principal  employer  and
13contractor  is  foreign  to  the  Act  and  the  occupier/the
principal employer cannot be made responsible for the
payment of minimum rate of wages to a contract labour.
Allegations of exploitation of workmen by the employers
cannot be a ground for issuance of a notification under
Section 5 of the Act if the Government lacks jurisdiction.  
8.Dr. Monika Gusain, learned counsel appearing for the
State of Haryana referred to Article 43 of the Constitution
of India to submit that it is the duty of the State to secure
a  living  wage  to  all  workers.   She  submitted  that  the
Notifications  were  issued  on  the  basis  of
recommendations made by an Advisory Committee after
consultations  with  the  employers  and  the  workmen.
Splitting  of  the  minimum  wages  into  components  is
permissible as there is no prohibition in the Act.   She
contended  that  the  deemed  promotion  of  an  unskilled
worker to a semi-skilled worker, based on experience, is
only for the purpose of entitling them to the next grade of
minimum wages which cannot be construed as a deemed
promotion or classification.  Dr. Gusain stated that it has
come to the notice of the Government that trainees were
14not being paid even the minimum wages applicable to an
unskilled workman for which reason it was decided that
trainees should be protected.  The learned counsel for the
State  of  Haryana  defended  the  Notifications  dated
27.06.2007 and 21.10.2015 on the ground that they were
issued to protect the fundamental rights of the workers.
She also argued that the Appellants have not produced
any material to  show  the loss caused to  them  by the
Notifications, and hence, the judgment of the High Court
does not warrant interference.  
9.At this stage, it is necessary to refer to the relevant
provisions  of  the  Act.   “Wages”  and  “Employee”  have
been defined in Sections 2(h) and 2(i) of the Act which
reads as under:
 “2(h) “wages” means all remuneration, capable of
being expressed in terms of money, which would,
if  the  terms  of  the  contract  of  employment,
express or implied, were fulfilled, be payable to a
person employed in respect of his employment or
of work done in such employment,  [and includes
house rent allowance], but does not include—
(i) the value of—
15(a)  any  house-accommodation,  supply  of  light,
water, medical attendance, or
(b) any other amenity or any service excluded by
general  or  special  order  of  the  appropriate
Government;
(ii) any contribution paid by the employer to any
Pension  Fund  or  Provident  Fund  or  under  any
scheme of social insurance;
(iii) any travelling allowance or the value of any
travelling concession;
(iv)  any  sum  paid  to  the  person  employed  to
defray special expenses entailed on him by the
nature of his employment; or
(v) any gratuity payable on discharge;
2(i)  “employee”  means  any  person  who  is
employed for hire or reward to do any work, skilled
or  unskilled,  manual  or  clerical,  in  a  scheduled
employment in respect of which minimum rates of
wages  have  been  fixed;  and  includes  an  out-
worker to whom any articles or materials are given
out by another person to be made up, cleaned,
washed, altered, ornamented, finished, repaired,
adapted or otherwise processed for sale for the
purposes of the trade or business of that other
person  where  the  process  is  to  be  carried  out
either in the home of the out-worker or in some
other  premises  not  being  premises  under  the
16control and management of that other person; and
also  includes  an  employee  declared  to  be  an
employee  by  the  appropriate  Government;  but
does not include any member of the Armed Forces
of the  [Union].”
10.The  appropriate  government  is  empowered  by
Section 3 of the Act to fix the minimum rates of wages
payable to the employees employed in an employment
specified in Part I and Part I (b) of the Schedule.  Section 4
of the Act provides that the minimum rate of wages fixed
or revised under Section 3 may contain:
 “(i) a basic rate of wages and a special allowance
at a rate to be adjusted, at such intervals and in
such manner as the appropriate Government may
direct, to accord as nearly as practicable with the
variation  in  the  cost  of  living  index  number
applicable to such workers (hereinafter referred to
as the “cost of living allowance”); or
(ii) a basic rate of wages with or without the cost
of  living  allowance,  and  the  cash  value  of  the
concessions  in  respect  of  supplies  of  essential
commodities  at  concession  rates,  where  so
authorised; or
17(iii) an all-inclusive rate allowing for the basic rate,
the cost of living allowance and the cash value of
the concessions, if any.”
11.The  procedure  for  fixing  or  revising  the  minimum
rates of wages is dealt with under Section 5 of the Act.
After following the procedure prescribed under Section 5,
the appropriate government can fix/revise the minimum
rates of wages and issue a notification to that effect.  An
obligation is imposed on the employer by Section 12 of
the Act to pay to every employee engaged in a scheduled
employment wages at a rate not less than the minimum
rates  of  wages  fixed  by  the  notification  issued  under
Section  5  of  the  Act.   The  authority  conferred  on  the
Government in fixing or revising the minimum rates of
wages under the relevant provisions of the Act was dealt
with by this Court in  Bidi, Bidi Leaves and Tobacco
Merchants’ Association  (supra).  This Court held:
“What is the extent of the authority conferred
on the respondent in fixing or revising minimum
rates of wages under the relevant provisions of
the Act? In  dealing with  this question we must
necessarily bear in mind the definition of the term
“wages” prescribed by Section 2(h). As we have
18already  seen  the  term  “wages”  includes
remuneration  which  would,  if  the  terms  of  the
contract of employment, express or implied, were
fulfilled,  be  payable  to  a  person  employed  in
respect of his employment. In other words, the
term “wages” refers to remuneration payable to
the  employee  as  a  result  of  the  terms  of
employment. What would be the amount to which
the employee is entitled if the other terms of the
contract  are  performed?  That  is  the  question
which has to be asked in determining what the
term “wages” means under Section 2(h). No doubt
Sections  3,  4  and  5  authorise  the  appropriate
Government to fix the minimum rates of wages. In
other  words,  if  the  wages  fixed  by  a  contract
which is either express or implied are found to be
low,  authority  is  conferred  on  the  appropriate
Government to increase them so as to bring them
to the level of what the said Government regards
as the minimum wages in the particular scheduled
employment in the particular area concerned. This
means that power is conferred on the appropriate
Government to modify one term of the contract
express or implied between the employer and the
employee and that is a term which has reference
to the payment of wages. If for a certain piece of
work  done  by  the  employee  the  employer  has
agreed  to  pay  him  either  expressly  or  by
19implication  a  certain  amount  of  wages  the
appropriate Government can issue a notification
and prescribe that for the said work done under
the contract the employer must pay his employee
a much higher rate of wages and the higher rate
of wages thus prescribed would be deemed to be
the minimum rate of wages between the parties.
It would, however, be noticed that in defining
“wages” clause 2(h) postulates that they would be
payable  if  the  other  terms  of  the  contract  of
employment  are  fulfilled.  That  is  to  say,  in
authorising  the  fixation  of  minimum  rates  of
wages  the  other  terms  of  the  contract  of
employment  have  always  to  be  fulfilled.  The
fulfilment of the others terms of the contract is a
condition precedent for the payment of wages as
defined under Section 2(h) and it continues to be
such a condition precedent even for the payment
of  the  minimum  rates  of  wages  fixed  and
prescribed by  the  appropriate Government.  The
significance of the definition contained in Section
2(h) lies in the fact that the rate of wages may be
increased but no change can be made in the other
terms  of  the  contract.  In  other  words,  the  Act
operated on the wages and does not operate on
the  other  terms  of  the  contract  between  the
employer  and  the  employee.  That  is  the  basic
approach which must be adopted in determining
20the scope and effect of the powers conferred on
the  appropriate  Government  by  the  relevant
provisions of the statute authorising it to prescribe
minimum rates of wages or to revise them. What
the appropriate Government is authorised to do is
to prescribe, fix or revise wages and wages are
defined  to  be  remuneration  payable  to  the
employees  if  the  terms  of  the  contract  of
employment,  express  or  implied,  were  fulfilled.
This definition runs, as it inevitably must, through
the  material  provisions  of  the  Act  and  its
importance cannot therefore be ignored.”
12.The learned counsel for the Government of Haryana
argued that the workmen are exploited by the employers
and the notifications were issued after taking into account
the recommendations of the expert body to protect the
interests  of  the  workmen.   The  point  raised  by  the
Appellants pertains to the jurisdiction of the Government
in the issuance of the notification.  The grievances of the
workmen can be redressed by the fora constituted under
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1948 if the Government does
not have the competence to deal with certain issues in a
notification under the Act.  In  Bidi, Bidi Leaves and
21Tobacco  Merchants’  Association  (supra),  Justice
Gajendragadkar, observed :-
 “It  is  well  settled  that  industrial  adjudication
under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act
14 of 1947 is given wide powers and jurisdiction to
make appropriate awards in determining industrial
disputes brought before it. An award made in an
industrial  adjudication  may  impose  new
obligations  on  the  employer  in  the  interest  of
social justice and with a view to secure peace and
harmony between the employer and his workmen
and  full  co-operation  between  them.  Such  an
award may even alter the terms of employment if
it is thought fit and necessary to do so. In deciding
industrial disputes the jurisdiction of the tribunal is
not  confined  to  the  administration  of  justice  in
accordance  with  the  law  of  contract.  As
Mukherjea,  J.,  as  he  then  was,  has  observed
in Bharat  Bank  Ltd.,  Delhi  v. Employees  of  the
Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi  the tribunal “can confer
rights  and  privileges  on  either  party  which  it
considers  reasonable  and  proper,  though  they
may  not  be  within  the  terms  of  any  existing
agreement. It has not merely to interpret or give
effect  to  the  contractual  rights  and  obligations
between  them  which  it  considers  essential  for
keeping industrial peace”. Since the decision of
the  Federal  Court  in  Western  India  Automobile
22Association v. Industrial Tribunal, Bombay  , it has
been  repeatedly  held  that  the  jurisdiction  of
Industrial  Tribunals  is  much  wider  and  can  be
reasonably  exercised  in  deciding  industrial
disputes  with  the  object  of  keeping  industrial
peace  and  progress  (Vide:  Rohtas  Industries,
Ltd. v. Brijnandan  Pandey,  Patna  Electric  Supply
Co.  Ltd.,  Patna  v. Patna  Electric  Supply  Workers'
Union). Indeed, during the last ten years and more
industrial adjudication in this country has made so
much progress in determining industrial disputes
arising between industries of different kinds and
their employees that the jurisdiction and authority
of Industrial Tribunals to deal with such disputes
with  the  object  of  ensuring  social  justice  is  no
longer seriously disputed.”
13.There is no power vested in the Government by the
Act  to  make  alterations  to  the  terms  of  a  contract.
Jurisdiction is conferred by the Act on the Government to
fix/revise the minimum  rates of wages notwithstanding
the  contract.   The  Notification  dated  21.10.2015
postulates  that  unskilled  employees  having  five  years
experience would be deemed categorized as semi-skilled
“A”; that after three years of experience in semi-skilled
“A”, the employees would be deemed categorized as semi-
23skilled “B”; that after three years of experience in skilled
“A”,  the  employees  would  be  deemed  categorized  as
skilled  “B”.   Such  categorization  or  classification  by
deeming workmen in one category to belong to another
category  is  in  direct  contravention  of  the  contract
between the employer and the employee and is beyond
the jurisdiction of the Government.  Inclusion of Security
inspector/ Security officer/ Supervisor at Serial No.9 in the
table “Minimum rates of wages in respect of all scheduled
employment”  in  the  Notification  is  ultra  vires the
provisions of the Act.  They do not fall within the definition
of “employee’ in Section 2(i) as they do not discharge any
skilled or unskilled, manual or clerical work.4  Similarly,
not  all  trainees  can  be  included  in  the  Notification.
Trainees who receive wages during the period of training
would fall under the definition of “employee” as has been
fairly admitted by the learned counsel for the Appellants.
It is the Appellant’s case that such of those trainees who
are  not  paid  any  wages  cannot  be  included  in  the
notification.   We  are  in  agreement  with  the  said
submission as only a person who is employed for “hire or
4 See: Haryana Unrecognized Schools’ Association  (supra)  
24reward”  will  fall  under  the  definition  of  “employee”.
Consequent upon the above finding, the trainees who are
not paid wages cannot be included in the notification and
the fixation of minimum wages for such trainees at 75% is
also not valid.  T o make it clear, the minimum wages fixed
for trainees who are appointed for reward is not interfered
with.  The period of training to be undergone by a trainee
would depend upon the contract between the employer
and  the  employee.   There  is  no  power  vested  in  the
Government under the Act to decide the period of training
and any stipulation with regard to the training period is
ultra vires.  
14.The word “employee” as defined in the Act means
any  person  who  is  employed  for  hire  or  reward  in  a
scheduled  employment.   There  is  no  distinction  made
between a person employed by the principal employer
and a person employed through a contractor. Any person
who  employs,  whether  directly  or  through  any  other
person,  one  or  more  employees  in  a  scheduled
employment falls within the definition of an “employer”.5
A close scrutiny of the definitions of the employer and the
5 Section 2(e), Minimum Wages Act, 1948 
25employee would show that workmen employed through
the contractors fall within the purview of the Act.  We
reject the submission made on behalf of the Appellants
that the contract workmen are not covered under the Act.
15.The  other  point  that  remains  to  be  considered  is
regarding the segregation of wages into components in
the  form  of  allowances.  It  is  useful  to  refer  to  the
judgment of this Court in  Airfreight Ltd.  v.  State of
Karnataka6 in which this Court observed: 
 “20. … … … Once rates of minimum wages are
prescribed under the Act, whether as all-inclusive
under Section 4(1)(iii) or by combining basic plus
dearness allowance under Section 4(1)(i), are not
amenable  to  split  up.  It  is  one  pay  package.
Neither the scheme nor any provision of the Act
provides that the rates of minimum wages are to
be split up on the basis of the cost of each of the
necessities taken into consideration for fixing the
same.”
16.“Wages”  is  defined  in  Section  2(h)  to  mean  all
remuneration,  capable  of  being  expressed  in  terms  of
6 (1999) 6 SCC 567
26money, which would, if the terms of the contract of the
employment, express or implied were fulfilled, be payable
to a person in respect of his employment or of work done
in such employment and includes house rent allowance.
There are four exclusions in the definition of wages which
pertain  to  travelling  allowance,  value  of  housing
accommodation,  supply  of  light,  water,  medical
attendance,  etc.  If  certain  components  of  the
remuneration  are  taken  care  of  by  the  employer,  he
cannot  be  asked  to  pay  twice  over  such  allowance/
payments which are part of the remuneration.  Therefore,
we are of the opinion that the prohibition on segregation
of the wages into components under the notification dated
21.10.2015 is not a valid exercise of power.  
17.Our  conclusion  in  respect  of  some  parts  of  the
Notification will not affect the Notifications as such.  The
part of the Notifications other than that which are dealt
with by this judgment shall continue to be in force. We
make it clear that the employers shall not be entitled to
recover any amounts paid under the Notifications to the
workmen on the ground that they have succeeded in this
27case.  As the findings recorded in this judgment pertain to
the  jurisdiction  of  the  Government  under  the  Act,  the
workmen are not precluded from seeking redressal of their
grievances  by  resorting  to  other  remedies  available  to
them under law.
18.The upshot of the above discussion is :
(a)The  prohibition  of  segregation  of  wages
into  components  in  the  form  of  allowances  in  the
Notification is impermissible;
(b)The security inspector/ security officer/ security
supervisor cannot be included in the Notification;
(c)Trainees  who  are  employed  without
payment  of  any  reward  cannot  be  covered  by  the
Notification;
(d)Categorization of unskilled employees as semi-
skilled on the basis of their experience is ultra vires the
Act;
(e)Fixing the training period to a period of one year
is beyond the jurisdiction of the Government. 
19.For  the  aforementioned  reasons,  the  appeals  are
allowed.

is briefly stated as under :
2.1.The   Appellants   through   their   Partnership   Firm   viz.

Land   Reforms   Act,   1963   (1   of   1964)   or   any
building   or   structure   standing   thereon   or
appurtenant thereto.
Explanation:­   For   the   purposes   of   this   sub­
section, ‘cultivation’ includes cultivation of trees
or plants of any species.
(3)   Nothing   contained   in   sub­section   (1)   shall

him, which together with another lands held by
him   to   which   Chapter   III   of   the   Kerala   Land
Reforms   Act,   1963,   is   applicable,   does   not
exceed the extent of the ceiling area applicable to
him under Section 82 of the said Act.
(4)   Notwithstanding   anything   contained   in   the
Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963, private forests

subsection (3), be deemed to be lands to which
Chapter III of the said Act is applicable and for
the   purposes   of   calculating   the   ceiling   limit
applicable to an owner, private forests shall be
deemed   to   be   ‘other   dry   lands’   specified   in
Schedule II to the said Act.
(emphasis supplied)
     As per Section 3(1) of the Act, the ownership and
possession of all private forests in the State of Kerala
vested   in   the   State   Government   with   effect   from
10.05.1971.
    Section 3(2) provided an exemption if the land was
under personal cultivation of the owner.
3   Section 3(3) provided a further exemption if the land
was intended for cultivation, and if the extent of land
was below the ceiling limit under Section 82 of the
Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963.
   The constitutional validity of the Act was upheld by
this Court in  State of Kerala  v. Gwalior Rayon .1
2.3.The   100   acres   of   land   comprised   in   Survey   No.
186/1A1 was private forest land, which vested in the
State Government w.e.f. 10.05.1971.
2.4.In 1975, the Forest Department took over possession of
the aforesaid land.
2.5.In 1990 i.e. 19 years after the land had vested in the
State Government, and 15 years after possession was
taken over by the Forest Department, the Appellants
filed O.A. No. 204/1990 under Section 8 of the Act
before the Forest Tribunal, Kozhikode.
   The Appellants sought a Declaration that out of the
100 acres of land in Survey No. 186/1A1, 79 acres and
68.5 cents was not private forest land. They claimed
1 (1973) 2 SCC 713.
4exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act, and submitted
that   they   were   cultivating   the   land   with   various
agricultural crops such as rubber, coffee, cardamom,
cocoa and lemon grass.
2.6.The Tribunal appointed a Commissioner to carry out
inspection of the land. 
   The first inspection was carried out in 1993. As per
the Report submitted by the Commissioner, there was
no improvement on the land.
      The   second   inspection   was   carried   out   on
20.05.1995.   As   per   the   Report   submitted   by   the
Commissioner, major portions of the land in question,
and   the   adjoining   vested   forest,   was   planted   with
acacia trees aged approximately 8 years.
   The third inspection was carried out on 24.01.1998.
As per the Report submitted by the Commissioner, the
entire area of the land was mainly planted with acacia
and silver oaks aged 10 to 12 years.
5      As   per   the   Final   Report   submitted   by   the
Commissioner,   the   property   purchased   by   the
Appellants originally admeasured 100 acres. Out of the
100 acres, 80 acres of land vested in the State, while
20 acres of land was retained by the Appellants. Out of
the said 20 acres, 12.60 acres of land was taken by the
State as excess land under the provisions of the Kerala
Land Reforms Act, 1963.
2.7.The   Forest   Tribunal   vide  Order   dated   11.07.2000
dismissed the O.A. filed by the Appellants.
   It was held that there was no evidence to show that
the land in Survey No. 186/1A1 was cultivated with
any agricultural crops prior to 10.05.1971.
   As a consequence, the Appellants were not entitled to
claim the exemption under Section 3(2) on the ground
that the land was under their personal cultivation.
2.8.Aggrieved by the aforesaid Order, the Appellants filed
MFA No. 389/2002 before the High Court. The High
6Court vide impugned final Judgment and Order dated
01.01.2008 dismissed the Appeal.
    It was held that in view of the 3 Reports submitted
by the Commissioner, there was no evidence of any
cultivation on the Appellants’ property on or prior to
the   date   of   vestment   i.e.   10.05.1971.   Hence,   the
Appellants were not entitled to the exemption under
Section 3(2) of the Act.
     The Appellants produced a Registration Certificate
from the Rubber Board for cultivating 10 acres of land
which was issued prior to vesting. The Commissioner’s
Reports   revealed   that   the   Appellants   were   in
possession of 20 acres and 31.5 cents of land. Out of
the said area, 12.5 acres of land had been surrendered
as excess land under the Ceiling Act. The Appellants
were therefore, in active possession of only 7.85 acres
of land.
     The High Court held that against the claim of the
Appellants for 79 acres and 68.5 cents of land, the
7Appellants   were   entitled   to   get   exemption   under
Section 3(3) only with respect to 7.85 acres of land.
2.9.Aggrieved by the aforesaid Judgment, the Appellants
filed the present Civil Appeals.
3.We   have   heard   the   learned   Counsel   for   the   parties,   and
perused the material on record.
3.1.The Appellants contended that the land in question
falls in the Malabar District. Hence, as per Section 2(f)
(1) of the Act, the land in question is not private forest
land, and could not have been taken over by the State.
     Section 2(f) of the Act defines a “private forest”.
Section 2(f) is set out hereinbelow for ready reference :
“2(f) ""private forest"" means
(1) in relation to the Malabar district referred to
in   sub­section   (2)   of   Section   5   of   the   State
Reorganization   Act,   1956   (Central   Act   37   of
1956)­
(i) any land which the Madras Preservation of
Private Forest Act, 1949 (Madras Act XXVII of
1949), applied immediately before the appointed
day excluding­
(A) land which are gardens or nilams as defined
in   the   Kerala   Land   Reforms   Act.   1963   (1   of
1964).
8(B)   lands   which   are   used   principally   for   the
cultivation   of   tea,   coffee,   cocoa,   rubber,
cardamom or cinnamon and lands used for any
purpose ancillary to the cultivation of such crops
or for the preparation of the same for the market.
Explanation:­ Lands used for the construction of
office buildings, godowns, factories, quarters for
workmen,   hospitals,   schools   and   playgrounds
shall   be   deemed   to   be   lands   used   purposes
ancillary to the cultivation of such crops;
(C) lands which are principally cultivated with
cashed   or   other   fruit   bearing   trees   or   are
principally cultivated and any other agricultural
crop and
(D) sites of buildings and land appurtenant to
and necessary for the convenient enjoyment or
use of such buildings;
(ii) any forest not owned by the Government, to
which   the   Madras   Preservation   of   private
Forests Act, 1949 did not apply, including waste
lands which are enclaves within wooded areas.
(2) in relation to the remaining areas in the State
of   Kerala   any   forest   not   owned   by   the
Government   including   waste   lands   which   are
enclaves within wooded areas.
Explanation:­ For the purpose of this clause, a
land   shall   be   deemed   to   be   waste   land
notwithstanding   the   existence   thereon   of
scattered trees or shrubs.”
4.The   land   in   question   falls   in   the   Malabar   District.   As   a
consequence,   sub­section   (1)   of   Section   2(f)   would   be
applicable in the present case.
9   As per Clause (i) of sub­section (1) of Section 2(f), “private
forest” includes any land to which the Madras Preservation of
Private   Forest   Act,   1949   applied   prior   to   10.05.1971.
However,   it   excludes   lands   which   were   principally   under
cultivation   of   tea,   coffee,   cocoa,   rubber,   cardamom   or
cinnamon and lands used for any purpose ancillary to the
cultivation of such crops or for the preparation of the same
for the market.
   The land in question vested in the State on 10.05.1971 i.e.
more than 48 years ago. The possession was taken over by
the State in 1975. The Courts below have arrived at a finding
of fact that there was no cultivation whatsoever on the land
in question on 10.05.1971. The Appellants have failed to
produce any evidence of cultivation on the land in question.
   The land in question is therefore, covered by the definition
of “private forest” under the Act, and the Act makes it clear
that   all   private   forests   in   the   State   of   Kerala   would
automatically vest in the State Government with effect from
10.05.1971.   The   Appellants   are   not   entitled   to   the
10exemptions under sub­sections (2) and (3) of Section 3 of the
Act.
     We however, affirm the exemption granted by the High
Court under Section 3(3) with respect to 7.85 acres of land.
In light of the aforesaid discussion, the Civil Appeals are
dismissed. All pending Applications, if any, are accordingly
disposed of.
Ordered accordingly.

confirmed the conviction of the original accused for the offences
punishable   under   Section   376   (2)   (f)   and   Section   201  of  the
Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as Sections 5(i), 5(m) and 5(r)
read with Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) and has confirmed the death
penalty   imposed,   original   accused   has   preferred   the   present
appeal.
2. That the appellant/original accused was tried by the Trial
Court for the offences punishable under Section 376 (2) (f) and
Section 201 of the IPC as well as Sections 5(i), 5(m) and 5(r) read
with   Section   6   of   the   POCSO   Act   for   having   committed   the
murder of the minor girl aged 71/2  years after raping her. On
considering the incriminating material against the accused and
on appreciation the evidences and having considered that the
accused was last seen together with the deceased and that the
frock of the victim was found lying on the cot along with blood
stains on bed mattress and bedsheet in the house of the accused,
which was not explained by the accused, and also considering
the medical evidence, the Trial Court convicted the accused forCriminal Appeal No. 1112 of  2015                      3
the offences under Section 376 (2) (f) and Section 201 of the IPC
as well as Sections 5(i), 5(m) and 5(r) read with Section 6 of the
POCSO   Act.   The   Trial   Court   sentenced   the   accused   to   life
imprisonment and other terms of the imprisonment with fine. All
the   sentences   were   directed   to   run   concurrently.   Learned
Additional Sessions Judge also sentenced the accused to death
penalty. Having sentenced the accused with death penalty, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge made the reference to the High
Court. Being aggrieved with the conviction and the sentence, the
accused also preferred Criminal Appeal No.198 of 2014 before the

High Court has decided the reference against the accused and

whereby,   the   High   Court   has   confirmed   the   conviction   and

accused has preferred the present criminal appeal.Criminal Appeal No. 1112 of  2015                      4
3. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
accused at length.
4.   Learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   accused   has
vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the
case, both the courts below have materially erred in holding the
accused guilty for the offences under Section 376 (2) (f) and
Section 201 of the IPC as well as Sections 5(i), 5(m) and 5(r) read
with Section 6 of the POCSO Act. He has vehemently submitted
that in the present case, there is no eye­witness of the incident
and the entire case is based on circumstantial evidence. It is
submitted that unless and until the chain of evidence proves the
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in committing the
crime, both the courts have materially erred in convicting the
accused.
5. Alternatively, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
accused   has   prayed   to   commute   the   death   sentence   to   life
imprisonment.   Learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the
accused has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in
Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab  (1980) 2 SCC 684 as well as theCriminal Appeal No. 1112 of  2015                      5
recent decision of this Court in  Shyam Singh alias Bhima v. State
of Madhya Pradesh  (2017) 11 SCC 265.
6. Heard   the   learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the
respective parties at length. Considering the submissions made
by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf  of  the respective
parties   and   the   findings   recorded   by   the   Trial   Court   on
appreciation of evidence which were confirmed by the High court,
we are of the firm view that the conviction of the accused for the
offences under Section 376 (2) (f) and Section 201 of the IPC as
well as Sections 5(i), 5(m) and 5(r) read with Section 6 of the
POCSO Act does not call for any interference as the findings
recorded by the Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court
are on appreciation of evidence.
6.1 In the  present  case, prosecution  has  been  successful  in
proving that the accused was last seen together with the victim;
that he gave one rupee coin to the victim; he told one of the
witness   viz   Bharati,   who   was   with   the   victim   to   go   away;
thereafter the dead body of the victim was found near the house
of the accused and that the frock of the victim was lying on theCriminal Appeal No. 1112 of  2015                      6
cot and the bed mattress and bedsheet were blood stained and
the same was matched with the blood group of the victim and
that   the   accused   failed   to   explain   the   incriminating
material/evidence   found   against   him   in   the   statement   under
Section 313 of Cr.P.C, the Trial Court has rightly convicted the
accused which has rightly been confirmed by the High Court.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused has failed to
satisfy this Court how the findings recorded by the Trial Court,
confirmed   by   the   High   Court,   holding   the   accused   guilty   for
having   committed   the   murder   after   raping   a   minor   girl   are
perverse and/or contrary to the evidence on record. Under the
above circumstances, we confirm the judgment and order of the
conviction   passed   by   the   Trial   Court,   confirmed   by   the   High
Court.
7. Now, so far as the request and the prayer made on behalf of
the accused to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment
is concerned, having heard the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the accused  on the question of death sentence imposed
by the learned Sessions Court, confirmed by the High Court andCriminal Appeal No. 1112 of  2015                      7
considering the totality and circumstances of the case and the
decisions of this Court in the cases of  Bachan Singh  (supra) and
Shyam Singh  (supra), we are of the opinion that the present case
does not fall within the category of ‘rarest of rare case’ warranting
death penalty. We have considered each of the circumstance and
the crime as well as the facts leading to the commission of the
crime by the accused. Though, we acknowledge the gravity of the
offence, we are unable to satisfy ourselves that this case would
fall in the category of ‘rarest of rare case’ warranting the death
sentence. The offence committed, undoubtedly, can be said to be
brutal, but does not warrant death sentence. It is required to be
noted   that   the   accused   was   not   a   previous   convict   or   a
professional killer. At the time of commission of offence, he was
19   years   of   age.   His   jail   conduct   also   reported   to   be   good.
Considering   the   aforesaid   mitigating   circumstances   and
considering the aforesaid decisions of this Court, we think that it
will be in the interest of justice to commute the death sentence to
life imprisonment.  Criminal Appeal No. 1112 of  2015                      8
8. In   view   of   the   above   and   for   the   reasons   stated   above,
present appeal challenging the conviction is hereby dismissed.
His  conviction  for  the  offences  under Section  376  (2)  (f)  and
Section 201 of the IPC as well as Sections 5(i), 5(m) and 5(r) read
with Section 6 of the POCSO Act is hereby confirmed. However,
in the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons
stated   above,   we   commute   the   death   sentence   to   life
imprisonment.
9. Present appeal stands disposed of accordingly, in terms of
the above.

Uttaradi Mutt            …..Appellant(s)

A.M. Khanwilkar, J.  
1. This appeal  arises from the judgment and decree dated 
14th November, 2017 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at 
Bangalore in R.S.A. No.100446 of 2015, whereby the High 
Court  was pleased to set aside the judgment and decre e 
passed by the First Appellate Court and also that of the trial 
Court and relegated the parties before the trial Court , by 
allowing three applications filed by the respondent/defendant 
under Order XLI Rule 27  of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (for 2 
 
short, “CPC”). The High Court directed the trial Court to decide 
the suit afresh by giving its findings in light of the additional 
evidence  adduced . The operative part of the order passed by 
the High Court reads thus:  
“25. Therefore, this Court cannot decide the substantial 
questions of law on which the said present second appeal 
was admitted on 13.04.2016 at this stage and the matter 
deserves to go back to the trial Court by allowing the three 
applications filed under Order 41 Rule 27 of the CPC. All the 
three ap plications filed by the Defendant/Appellant -RSM 
under Order 41 Rule 27 of the CPC therefore, are allowed 
and setting aside the order dated 22.04.2015 passed by the 
FAC in its entirety, because even otherwise it appears to be 
self contradictory and vague pa rtial injunction granted by 
FAC, the matter is restored back to the learned trial Court to 
allow the said additional evidences to be placed on record 
and allow the parties to prove and disprove the same in 
accordance with law and then re -decide the suit gi ving its 
findings in the light of such additional evidence.  
 
In view of the long lapse of time, the trial Court is requested 
to expedite the matter and decide the suit again 
expeditiously.  
 
The present appeal is accordingly disposed of . No costs. All 
I.As. are also disposed of.”   
 
2. The central issue in this appeal is whether the High 
Court was justified in allowing the three applications filed by 
the respondent/defendant under Order XLI Rule 27  before the 
First Appellate Court. Furthermore, even if there w as just and 
sufficient reason for allowing the three applications , was the 
High Court justified in relegating the parties before the trial 3 
 
Court and directing the trial Court to re -decide the suit by 
giving its findings in light of the additional evidence ?  
 
3. This case has a chequered history. Shorn of unnecessary 
details  we propose to refer only to the facts relevant to decide 
this appeal. In the first appeal filed by the appellant /plaintiff  
before the Principal Senior Civil Judge & Chief Judicial 
Magistrate , Dharwad bearing  R.A. No.124 of 2014 (Original 
R.A. No.14 of 2011 before the Court of Senior Civil Judge, 
Gangawat hi) against the dismissal of the suit by the Additional 
Civil Judge, Ga ngawathi vide judgment and decree dated 18th 
June, 2011 in O.S. No.74 of 2010 (Original O.S. No.193 of 
1992), three applications under Order XLI Rule 27 for  
permission to  produc e additional evidence came to be filed  by 
the respondent/defendant.  The First Appellate Court 
considered the stated applications along with the first appeal 
preferred by the appellant/plaintiff. The First Appellate Court 
was pleased to dismiss the said applications preferred by the 
respondent/defendant ; and allow ed the appeal filed by the 
appellant/plaintiff on the basis of the evidence already 4 
 
brought  on record before the trial Court. The suit filed by the 
appellant was decreed in part by the First Appellate Court. The 
operative order passed by the First Appellate Court dated 22nd 
April, 2015, reads thus:  
 
“ORDER  
The Application filed by the Appellant under Order 41 Rule 
27 R/w Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is 
dismissed.  
The Application filed by the Appellant filed by the Appellant 
under Order 14 Rule 5 R/w Section 151 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure is dismissed.  
The Application filed by t he Respondent under Order 14 Rule 
5 R/w Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is 
dismissed.  
The Applications filed by the Respondent under Order 41 
Rule 27 R/w Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure are 
dismissed.  
The Application filed by the Resp ondent under Section 151 
of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking survey of Sy.No.192 of 
Anegundi Village is dismissed.  
The Application filed by the Respondent under Section 340 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure is dismissed.  
The Appeal filed by the Appella nt under Order 41 Rule 1 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure is allowed in part. The Judgment 
and Decree dated 18 -06-2011 passed by the Court of the 
Addl. Civil Judge, Gangavathi in O.S.No.74/2010 are set -
aside.  
The Suit of the Plaintiff is decreed in part. Sub ject to the 
right, if any, of the Defendant Mutt to perform Aradhanas 
and Poojas of the Vrindavanas in the Suit property, the 
Defendant is restrained by way of Perpetual Injunction from 
interfering with the Plaintiff Mutt’s possession and 
enjoyment of the Suit property. It is hereby clarified that the 
above said raider shall not be construed as declaring the 
right of the Defendant Mutt to perform Aradhanas and 
Poojas.  
Costs are made easy.  
The Office is directed to transmit a copy of the Judgment 
and Decree to the trial Court along with LCR. ” 5 
 
4. Aggrieved  by the aforesaid decision , the 
respondent /defendant  preferred a second appeal before the 
High Court, being R.S.A. No.100446 of 2015 .  
 
5. As aforesaid, f or the nature of the order that we propose 
to pass and the i ssues to be answered in the present appeal, 
suffice it to observe that the second appeal, being R.S.A. 
No.100446 of 2015  filed by the respondent/ defendant  before 
the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore , was finally  decided 
vide impugned judgment dated 14th November, 2017. The High 
Court reversed the opinion of the First Appellate Court 
including the rejection of stated three applications  filed by the 
respondent/defendant under Order XLI Rule 27  of CPC . The 
High Court instead allow ed those applications and relegated 
the parties before the trial Court , as noted in the operative 
part of the impugned judgment extracted above.  
 
6. As regards the first issue as to whether the High Court 
has recorded sufficient reason s for allowing the three 
applications for permiss ion to produce additional evidence 
filed by the respondent/defendant under Order XLI Rule 27 of 6 
 
CPC before the First Appellate Court, the High Court has 
opined that the additional evidence sought to be brought on 
record , subject to proof, by the respondent /defendant , 
definitely , could have a material bearing on the issues involved 
in the suit and determin ing the right s of the appellant / 
plaintiff  to claim injunction against the respondent/defendant 
on the basis of the total land being in  their ownership or 
possession ( whether it was 14 Acres 7 Guntas or 27 Acres 30 
Guntas ). The High Court was of the view that it could change 
the entire basis of the rights of the respective parties and 
therefore such additional evidence sought  to be produced by 
the respondent /defendant ought not to be shut out. The High 
Court noted that  the First Appellate Court delivered a 
contrived  judgment without analysing  such additional 
evidence and otherwise also , it was a substantial cause for 
reaching just conclusion s and for correct evaluation of the 
rights of the respective parties , satisfying  the parameters of 
Order XLI  Rule 27 of CPC. To buttress this conclusion , the 
High Court relied on the dictum in paragraph 49 of the 
decision of this Court in Union of India Vs. Ibrahim  Uddin 7 
 
and Anr.1.  What essentially  weighed with the High Court for 
showing indulgence to the respondent/defendant can be 
discerned from the observations in paragraph 17 of the 
impugned judgment which read thus:  
“17. Prima facie , this Court finds that the additiona l evidence 
mostly in the form of Government letters and Orders could 
have a major impact on the issues involved before the Courts 
below and therefore deserved to be considered by the Court 
after being led and proved in accordance with law by 
concerned part y. Merely because the order dated 07.09.1974 
passed by Superintendent of Land Records became the 
subject matter of order by the KAT and even this Court, it 
does not prevent the trial Court or the FAC to allow such 
additional evidence taken on record and al low it to be proved 
in accordance with law and then consider and weigh such 
evidence and then decide the issues in accordance with law.  
Most of these documents were Government communication 
and Orders and were not in the control and possession of the 
defendant -RSM and defendant -RSM being not a party before 
KAT in the appeal filed by Vyasraja Mutt, the FAC should 
have allowed these Additional evidence which could have 
helped it in completing the quest for truth and meet the ends 
of justice and deliver a cor rect judgment. The failure to do so 
has resulted in serious miscarriage of justice. Without the 
title and peaceful possession of the entire land of 27 Acres 
and 30 Guntas proved by the plaintiff/respondent -UM, in 
the face of such contradicting Additional E vidence, the self 
contradictory and vague injunction granted by FAC cannot 
be sustained.”  
 
For that reason, the High Court  reversed the view taken by 
the First Appellate Court on the three applications preferred 
by the respondent/defendant under Order XLI  Rule 27 of CPC  
                                                           
1  (2012) 8 SCC 148  8 
 
and deemed it appropriate to relegate the parties to the trial 
Court.  
  
7. According to the appellant, the High Court ought not to 
have interfered with the discretion exercised by the First 
Appellate Court in dismissing the three applications for 
permission to produce additional evidence preferred by the 
respondent/defendant. Furthermore, the reasons weighed 
with the High Court, in no case,  satisfied  the test for 
production of additional evidence predicated in Order XLI Rule 
27 of CPC . 
 
8. This ob jection need not detain us as we are of the 
considered opinion that the First Appellate Court would have 
been within its jurisdiction to permit the party to the 
proceedings to produce additional evidence before it for full, 
complete and effectual adjudicat ion of the proceedings. The 
purport of Order XLI Rule 27 of CPC  has been considered by 
this Court in Union of India  (supra). The Court adverted to 
the exposition made in earlier decisions of the Court from 9 
 
paragraphs 36 to 46 and summed up the proposition in 
paragraphs 47 and 48 as under:  
 
“47. Where the additional evidence sought to be adduced 
removes the cloud of doubt over the case and the evidence 
has a direct and important bearing on the main issue in the 
suit and interest of justice clearly renders it  imperative that 
it may be allowed to be permitted on record, such application 
may be allowed.  
 
48. To sum up on the issue, it may be held that an 
application for taking additional evidence on record at a 
belated stage cannot be filed as a matter of right.  The court 
can consider such an application with circumspection, 
provided it is covered under either of the prerequisite 
conditions incorporated in the statutory provisions itself. The 
discretion is to be exercised by the court judicially taking 
into consi deration the relevance of the document in respect 
of the issues involved in the case and the circumstances 
under which such an evidence could not be led in the court 
below and as to whether the applicant had prosecuted his 
case before the court below dilig ently and as to whether such 
evidence is required to pronounce the judgment by the 
appellate court. In case the court comes to the conclusion 
that the application filed comes within the four corners of 
the statutory provisions itself, the evidence may be t aken on 
record, however, the court must record reasons as on what 
basis such an application has been allowed. However, the 
application should not be moved at a belated stage.”  
 
 
9. In the present case, the High Court has opined that the 
documents proposed to be produced by the 
respondent/defendant  were official records and public 
documents which, if proved, could enable the Appellate Court 
to pronounce the judgment and do full, complete and effectual 10 
 
justice  to the parties . In other words, the proposed additio nal 
evidence w as required by the Court to answer the subject 
matter and in particular, to pronounce the judgment on 
material issues.  
 
10. In paragraphs 49 -52 of the same reported decision of 
Union of India  (supra), the Court dealt with the question of 
stage o f consideration of applications under Order XLI Rule 27 
of CPC , in reference to earlier decisions of this Court. Be that 
as it may, on analyising the reasons recorded by the First 
Appellate  Court for rejecting the three applications filed by the 
respondent /defendant under Order XLI Rule 27 of CPC  and 
juxtaposing the same with the reasons recorded by the High 
Court for allowing those applications, in our opinion, the 
conclusion reached by the High Court on this count is 
impregnable.   
 
11. That takes us to the s econd contention raised by the 
appellant that even if there was sufficient ground for allowing 
the stated applications filed by the respondent/defendant  for 
production of additional evidence,  the genuineness and the 11 
 
contents of the additional documents would have to be proved 
by the part y placing reliance thereon. As regards this plea, we 
find that the High Court has made it amply clear that the fact 
that the application s are allowed per se is not to give  any 
direction to straightaway exhibit the additional  documents , 
but that it could be exhibited  subject to pro of. The High Court  
has unambiguously observed that the documents  will have to 
be proved in accordance with law.  We make it amply clear that  
by allowing the three applications filed by the 
respondent/ defendant under Order XLI Rule 27 of CPC , it 
would not follow  that the additional documents/ additional 
evidence can be straightaway exhibited rather,  the respondent 
would  have to not only prove the existence , authentic ity and 
genuineness of the said docume nts but also the contents 
thereof , as may be required by law.  
 
12. The further grievance of the appellant, however, is that 
the High Court, in any case, ought  not to have relegated the 
parties before the trial Court with a direction to the trial Court 
to re-decide the suit . The respondent, however, would rely on 12 
 
the provisions of the amended Rule 23 of the CPC “as 
applicable to the State of Karnataka ”. The same reads thus:  
 
“23. Remand of case by Appellate Court :- “Where the 
Court from whose decree an appeal i s preferred has disposed 
of the suit upon a preliminary point and the decree is 
reversed in appeal, or where the Appellate Court in 
reversing or setting aside the decree under appeal 
considers it necessary in the interests of justice to 
remand the case , the Appellate Court may by order remand 
the case, and may further direct what issue or issues shall 
be tried in the case so remanded and whether any further 
evidence shall or shall not be taken after remand, and shall 
send a copy of its judgment or order to the Court from whose 
decree the appeal is preferred, with directions to re -admit the 
suit under its original number in the register of civil suits, 
and proceed to determine the suit; the evidence, if any, 
recorded during the original trial shall subject to  all just 
exceptions, be evidence during the trial after remand.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
 
13. Indeed, the provision as applicable to the State of 
Karnataka is not limited to the decree disposing of  the suit on 
a preliminary point but also where the Appellate Cou rt in 
reversing or setting aside the decree under appeal, considers it 
necessary , in the interest of justice , to remand the case. 
Notably, t he Karnataka amendment has been introduced vide 
the Karnataka  Gazette entry dated 5th November, 1959.  The 
effect of  that provision is reinforced  by Central Amendment Act 13 
 
104 of 1976 which introduced Rule 23 -A. The said Rule 23 -A 
reads thus:  
 
“23-A. Remand in other cases. - Where the Court from 
whose decree an appeal is preferred has disposed of the case 
otherwise than o n a preliminary point, and the decree is 
reversed in appeal and a re -trial is considered necessary, the 
Appellate Court shall have the same powers as it has under 
rule 23.”  
 
 
14.  We say so because under Rule 23  of CPC , the Appellate 
Court could remand the cas e before it where the Court from 
whose decree an appeal was preferred, had disposed of the 
suit upon a preliminary point and that decree was reversed in 
appeal.  Rule 23 -A deals with other ( residuary ) category of 
cases  to be remanded by the Appellate Court  in an appeal 
against a decree which has been disposed of otherwise than on 
a preliminary point. While exercising such discretion , the 
Appellate Court is duty bound to keep in mind  Rules 25 and 
26 of Order XLI  of the CPC , which read thus:  
 
“25. Where Appel late Court may frame issues and refer 
them for trial to Court whose decree appealed from. - 
Where the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred 
has omitted to frame or try any issue, or to determine any 
question of fact, which appears to the Appellate  Court 
essential to the right decision of the suit upon the merits, 
the Appellate Court may, if necessary, frame issues, and 14 
 
refer the same for trial to the Court from whose decree the 
appeal is preferred and in such case shall direct such Court 
to take th e additional evidence required;  
And such Court shall proceed to try such issues, and shall 
return the evidence to the Appellate Court together with its 
findings thereon and the reasons therefor [within such time 
as may be fixed by the Appellate Court or ex tended by it from 
time to time].”  
 
“26. findings and evidence to be put on record – 
Objections to finding - (1) Such evidence and findings shall 
form part of the record in the suit; and either party may, 
within a time to be fixed by the Appellate Court, pre sent a 
memorandum of objections to any finding.  
 
(2) Determination of appeal. - After the expiration of the 
period so fi xed for presenting such memorandum the 
Appellate Court shall proceed to determine the appeal.”  
 
 
15. In other words, there are two options av ailable to the 
Appellate Court. First, it may record the evidence itself by 
permitting the parties to produce evidence before it as per Rule 
27 of Order XLI  or direct the Court from whose decree the 
appeal under consideration has arisen , to do so .  
  
16. The a ppellants have placed reliance on H.P. 
Vedavyasachar Vs. Shivashankara and Anr.2, which has 
also considered the decision in Shanti Devi Vs. Daropti 
Devi3. In the case of H.P. Vedavyasachar  (supra),  it was 
                                                           
2  (2009) 8 SCC 231  
3  (2006) 13 SCC 775  15 
 
specifically contended that no case was made out to  adduce 
additional evidence and in that event , the entire case could not 
have been remanded to  the trial Court for fresh disposal after 
recording fres h evidence as it was not a case  envisaged under 
Order XLI  Rule 2 3 of CPC. This contention has been 
conside red in paragraphs 7 to 10 of the said decision , in the 
following words :  
“7. However, so far as the second contention raised by the 
learned counsel for the appellant is concerned, in our 
opinion, the same has substance. When an application for 
adducing add itional evidence is allowed the appellate 
court has two options open to it. It may record the 
evidence itself or it may direct the trial court to do so.  
 
8. Order 41 Rule 28 CPC reads as under:  
“28. Mode of taking additional evidence .—Wherever 
additional e vidence is allowed to be produced, the appellate 
court may either take such evidence, or direct the Court 
from whose decree the appeal is preferred, or any other 
subordinate court, to take such evidence and to send it when 
taken to the appellate court.”  
For the aforementioned purpose, in our considered 
opinion, the High Court could not have directed the trial 
court to dispose of the suit after taking evidence. Such 
an order of remand could be only in terms of Order 41 
Rule 23, Order 41 Rule 23 -A or Order 41  Rule 25 of the 
Code.  None of the said provisions have any application in 
the instant case.  
 
9. This Court in Shanti Devi  v. Daropti Devi 1 has held as 
under: (SCC p. 778, para 13)  
“13. But the same by itself could not be a ground for 
remitting the entire s uit to the learned trial Judge upon 
setting aside the decree of the learned trial court. The 
power of remand vests in the appellate court either in 
terms of Order 41 Rules 23 and 23 -A or Order 41 Rule 25 16 
 
of the Code of Civil Procedure.  Issue 4 was held to have 
been wrongly framed. Onus of proof was also wrongly placed 
and only in that view of the matter the High Court thought it 
fit to remit it to the learned trial Judge permitting the parties 
to adduce fresh evidence. It, therefore, required the learned 
trial Judge to determine a question of fact, which according 
to it was essential, upon reframing the issue.”  
 
10. None of the aforementioned provisions were available to 
the High Court. We, therefore, in modification of the order 
passed by the High Court dir ect as under:  
(i) The learned trial court upon recording the evidence as 
directed by the High Court shall transmit the records to the 
first appellate court with a copy of its report annexed 
thereto.  
(ii) Such an exercise by the learned trial court must be 
completed within a period of four weeks from the date of 
communication of this order.  
 
(iii) The first appellate court must dispose of the first appeal 
on receipt of the said order as also the evidence as adduced 
as expeditiously as possible and not later than eight weeks 
from the date of receipt of the said report.  
 
We are passing the order keeping in view the fact that the 
appellant is said to have been dispossessed as far back as in 
1993. ” 
(emphasis supplied ) 
 
 
17.  In the present case, the High Court has no t recorded any 
special reasons as to why the parties should be relegated 
before the “trial Court ” to re-decide the suit. The only reason , 
which , presumably , weighed with the High Court,  is that it 
was necessary to find out the tr uth, as it is the duty of t he 
Court. That could be done even by directing the First Appellate 
Court to record evidence , which it was competent to do while 17 
 
hearing the first appeal , had it allowed the applications under 
Order XLI Rule 27 of CPC  by the respondent/defendant . For 
that, as per Rule 25 of Order XLI  of the CPC , the High Court 
could have framed the issues and refer red them for 
adjudicati on before  the First Appellate Court , against whose 
decree the second appeal was preferred before the High Court. 
It may be useful to advert to Rule s 28 & 29 of Order XLI of 
C.P.C. The same read thus:  
“28. Mode of taking additional evidence. - Wherever 
additional evidence is allowed to be produced, the Appellate 
Court may either take such evidence, or direct the Court 
from whose decree the appea l is preferred, or any other 
subordinate Court, to take such evidence and to send it 
when taken to the Appellate Court. ”  
“29. Points to be defined and recorded. - Where additional 
evidence is directed or allowed to be taken, the Appellate 
Court shall speci fy the points to which the evidence is to be 
confined, and record on its proceedings the points so 
specified.”  
 
 
The High Court could have issued  direction s to the First 
Appellate Court to determine any question of fact including the 
existence and genuinen ess of the additional evidence or for 
that matter, whether the contents of the said documents ha d 
been duly proved by the part y relying thereon . After recording 
the evidence in support of such relevant matters as the High 18 
 
Court may have direct ed, the First  Appellate Court could  
proceed to try such issues and return the evidence to the High 
Court together with its findings thereon within the prescribed 
time. Such a course was permissible in terms of Rule 28 of 
Order XLI of CPC . And o n receipt of the report, the High Court 
could then consider the substantial question s of law already 
framed while admitting the second appeal and finally decide 
the same  on all issues.  
 
18. Considering the che quered history of th is litigation and 
the fact that the suit was filed in t he year 1992, and that the 
writ petition against the order passed by the Superintendent of 
Land Records is stated to be pending before the High Court , it 
would be appropriate that the High Court frame s the points on 
which additional  evidence could  be addu ced by the 
respondent/defendant and call upon the First Appellate Court 
to record additional evidence and also consider the question  
of genuineness and authenticity of the additional evidence, 
including as to whether the contents thereof have been proved 
by the party relying thereon , and thereafter , to return the 19 
 
evidence to the High Court together with its finding s thereon 
and reasons thereof within the prescribed time. Such a course 
would meet the ends of justice.  
 
19. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned  judgment and 
order of the of the High Court in part, to the extent that it has 
relegated the parties before the trial Court for re -deciding the 
suit  after allowing the respondent/defendant to produce 
additional evidence in accordance with law.  Instead, the 
appeal is restored to the file of the High Court to its original 
number.  The High Court shall frame points on which  the 
additional evidence is allowed to be produced and direct the 
First Appellate Court to take the additional  evidence on record 
in accordance with law and then return the evidence to the 
High Court together with its findings thereon and the reasons 
thereof, within the prescribed time. Such directions be issued 
by the High Court expeditiously, preferably within two months 
from today. On receipt of the said report from the First 
Appellate Court , the High Court may then consider the Second 
Appeal on the substantial question s of law already framed or 20 
 
such other substantial questions of law that may arise for its 
consideration.   
 
20. The appeal  and the accompanying application  are 
disposed of in the aforementioned terms with no order as to 
costs.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 12367 OF 2017
         
THE STATE BANK OF INDIA & ORS.                ......APPELLANTS
           Versus
RAVINDRA NATH & ORS.                           …...RESPONDENTS
J U D G M E N T
Hemant Gupta, J .
The challenge in the present appeal is to an Order passed by the
Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court  of  Judicature  at  Bombay  on
09.07.2014, whereby the communication dated 16.01.2001 re-fixing the
salary of the respondent from 01.01.2001 was set aside.  
2.The respondent-writ petitioner before the High Court joined the
appellant Bank in the year 1981.  After almost nineteen years vide letter
dated 24.06.2000, he was posted at Johannesburg Branch (South Africa)
as Manager (Credit) as a Scale V Officer on a fixed salary of US $ 1965
(net) per month but subject to change from time to time.  Apart from
such salary, the respondent was granted various allowances including
reimbursement of education expenses of the children, usage of Bank’s
1car, leave and reimbursement of medical expenses apart from the host
of other allowances.  The relevant clause in respect of salary reads as
under: 
“1.1.A fixed salary US $ 1965 (net) per month
subject to change from time to time will be paid to
you abroad from the date of your reporting at the
foreign office.  Wherever taxes are payable by you
on account of salary and perquisites such taxes will
be reimbursed by the bank.”
3.There was also a condition that salary and terms and conditions as
spelt out in the letter are subject to review and revision by the Bank
from time to time.  Clause 7.3 in this respect reads as under: 
“7.3Your  salary  as  well  as  other  terms  and
conditions  spelt out in  this  letter are  subject  to
review  and  revision  by  the  bank,  from  time  to
time.”
4.It was on 16.01.2001, the salary in respect of the respondent was
re-fixed as US $ 1300 w.e.f. 01.01.2001. The same was subsequently
revised to US $ 1380 on 14.12.2001.  It is the stand of the Bank that
when the respondent was sent to Johannesburg, salary was fixed on
Consumer Price Index of 1992 on the basis of directives of the Working
Group of the Standing Committee w.e.f. 01.01.1995 in the absence of
availability of Cost of Living Index.  But since, the relevant data became
available in March 2000, the Working Group in its meeting held on
15.01.2001, has re-fixed the salary on the basis of formula approved by
the Standing Committee. 
25.The revised minimum net monthly salary in respect of Scale I
Officer was US $ 950 reduced from US $ 1615 per month, whereas, in
respect of Scale V Officer such as the respondent, the salary was fixed
at US $ 1300 reduced from US $ 1965.  The maximum salary in respect
of TEG Sp. SC. II, was US $ 1900 reduced from US $ 2565. The said
communication reads as under: 
REVISION OF SALARY WEF 01.01.2001
1.In the absence of availability of Cost of Living
Index data at the material time salary for Johannesburg
was fixed by the Working Group w.e.f. 01.01.1995 on
the basis of Consumer Price Index of 1992 (as per IMF
Publication of September, 1995) as available. 
2.With the relevant data now available the Working
Group in its meeting held on January 15, 2001 has re-
fixed the salary on the basis of the formula approved by
the Standing Committee. The detailed salary levels for
various grades with effect from 01.01.2001 will be as
under: 
Scale Net Monthly Salary

VII 2265 1600
TEG Sp. SC. I 2415 1750
TEG Sp. SC. II 2565 1900
36.The stand of the Bank is that the recommendations of the Working
Group are binding on the Bank which are applicable to all Public Sector
Banks, in respect of the Officers posted abroad.  The reliance was placed
upon  Section  18 of the  State  Bank  of  India  Act,  19551 as  also  the
proceedings of the Standing Committee from time to time, the reference
to which will be made subsequently.
7. The  High  Court  in  the  impugned  judgment  held  that  the
respondent-writ petitioner has no privity to contract with the Standing
Committee on the basis of which the salary was reduced.  It has also
held that the salary of the respondent has been reduced within three
months  which  is  unfair  and  arbitrary  and  that  the  letter  dated
24.06.2000 does not even remotely suggest that salary of US $ 1965
was tentative, nor the available information taken into consideration for
fixing the salary was shared with the respondent.  
8.The  High  Court  did  not  accept  the  argument  raised  by  the
respondent of the equal pay for equal work for the reason that the Cost
of Living in the different countries is different, therefore the salary must
necessarily be fixed keeping in mind various factors which vary from
country to country. 
9.In the present appeal, the appellant refers to the constitution of a
Committee by the Government of India in August 1981 for evolving
uniform guidelines on salaries and other terms applicable to Officers of
Indian Banks posted abroad.  The Report of the Committee produced
1 The Act
4before this Court is on record. Some of the relevant extracts from the
Report read as under: 
“12.The  salary  levels  recommended  by  the
committee for countries for which a detailed study has
been  made  are  given  in  Annexure-III.  T o  facilitate
comparison with the existing salary structure, not only
the gross salary recommended has been given but the
net take home salary after taxes etc., has also been
indicated  separately,  as  some  of  the  banks  have  a
practice of fixing the salary levels on the basis of net
take  home  pay.   The  salary  model  recommended
broadly follows the level obtaining in the State Bank,
determined as on 1979 and updated by building the
cost  of  living  indicates  for  1980  and  1981.   This
updating has been done on the basis of UK Cost and
Living Index figure after making an allowance of 5 % for
the  accommodation  factor  as  the  officers  stand
insulated from increases in cent of accommodation. 
xxx xxx xxx 
14.Before  applying  the  revised  model  set  of
provisions  conditions  outlined  in  Annexure  I  and  II,
Individual  banks  should  be  asked  to  work  out  the
impact  of  the  implementation  of  the  standardization
scheme on each of its officers working overseas so as to
ensure  that  the  adoption  of  the  standardisation
structures does not result in either too large a benefit or
sever curtailment of the existing emoluments.  While
the Committee has taken a broad view in the matter on
the basis of the information supplied by the various
banks, having regard to the limited number of officers
working abroad, an individualistic exercise as suggested
could be done to minimize the problems that may arise
on  this  score.   It  is,  therefore,  suggested  that  the
revised set of a service conditions be communicated to
all the banks who have overseas offices, with a request
to them to advise the standing committee, the present
salary and allowances pattern of each of the officers,
the revised salary and allowances payable and the net
difference.   Based  on  this  detailed  information,  the
standing  committee  may  modify  the  salary  levels
appropriately.”
5 
10.It  is,  thereafter  on  27.07.1982,  the  Government  again
communicated to Public Sector Banks that any change in future, in the
salaries, perquisites and other service conditions of Officers posted
abroad may be made in consultation with and with prior approval of
the  Standing  Committee  constituted  by  the  Government.   The
Standing  Committee  consists  of  Chairperson  of  four  Public  Sector
Banks and Joint Secretary in the Banking Division of the Government
of  India.  It  was  in  July,  1984,  the  appellant  Bank  framed  service
conditions and allied matters on personnel posted overseas. 
11.The fixation of salary of the Officers posted in Johannesburg
(South Africa), Botswana and Seychelles was considered by Working
Group of the Standing Committee in its meeting held on 15.01.2001.
In respect of fixation of salary for the Officers at Johannesburg, the
Cost of Living Index was revised on the basis of Bulletin of Statistics
published by U.N. in March, 2000 as 62, as compared to 100 of New
York.  Therefore, if the salary for Scale III Officers in New York is US $
1773, then the salary for Scale III Officers in South Africa would be
62% that is US $ 1099.26, say US $ 1100. On the basis of such
criteria, the net monthly salary of different grades of Officers was
fixed as was communicated to the respondent on 16.01.2001. 
12.The counter-affidavit filed by the respondent relies upon the
representations submitted by Chief Executive Officer of the Appellant-
Bank  posted  at  Johannesburg  Bank  on  22.01.2001  that  reduction
would cause extreme hardship to the Officers.  Such grievance was
6repeated subsequently. It is also pointed out that the representations
were not accepted on 12.04.2004, whereas, the term of posting of the
respondent came to end in November, 2004. It is also stated in the
affidavit  of  the  respondent  himself  that  he  has  taken  voluntary
retirement  on  18.03.2005,  after  paying  a  sum  of  Rs.  10,00,000/-
including payment of bond money. It is admitted on record that the
respondent after taking voluntary retirement on 18.03.2005 stayed in
Johannesburg only, where he was posted as an Officer of the Bank. 
13.Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the High Court
has  committed  material  illegality  in  holding  that  the  salary
communicated to the Officers on 24.06.2000, was not tentative. It is
contended  that  such  finding  is  contrary  to  the  letter  dated
24.06.2000, wherein, while communicating the salary of US $ 1965, it
was categorically mentioned that it is subject to change from time to
time.  Apart from the said fact, there was Clause 7.3 which is also to
the effect that salary as well as other terms and conditions spelt out in
the letter are subject to review and revision by the Bank from time to
time.  
14. Mr. Kaul learned counsel for the appellant-Bank has pointed out
that there was no alteration in the perquisites granted to the respondent
which was to the tune of Rs. 1,60,000/- per month.  It was only the
salary component which was reduced on availability of the Cost of Living
Index in March, 2000. 
15.A perusal of relevant conditions as reproduced above shows
that salary of US $ 1965 was not promised to be paid for the entire
7period of posting in Johannesburg. It was subject to change either way
that is increase or decrease.  The Bank has explained that such salary
of US $ 1965 was fixed in absence of Cost of Living Index on the basis
of  recommendations  of  the  Committee.  Later,  the  Standing
Committee was constituted in exercise of the powers under Section 18
of the Act mandating that any change in future in the salaries and
perquisites and other service conditions has to be affected with the
prior approval of the Standing Committee.  Section 18 of the Act reads
as under: 
 “18.Central Board to be guided by directions of
Central Government .—(1)In the discharge of its
functions  the  State  Bank  shall  be  guided  by  such
directions in matters of policy involving public interest
as the Central Government may, in consultation with
the governor of the Reserve Bank and the chairman of
the State Bank, give to it. 
(2)All  directions  shall  be  given  by  the  Central
government  and,  if  any  question  arises  whether  a
direction relates to a matter of policy involving public
interest,  the  decision  of  the  Central  Government
thereon shall be final.” 
16.It is in view of such directions that the appellant Bank framed
service conditions and allied matters.  It is thereafter on 15.1.2001, the
Working Group of the Standing Committee decided the salary payable to
the Officers of the Bank. Such salary structure is meant for all Officers of
Public  Sector  Banks  posted  abroad.  Such  recommendations  are
applicable  in non-discriminatory manner to all Officers  of the  Public
Sector Banks. 
17.Though, certain representations are said to have been made by
the  Chief  Executive  Officer  on  behalf  of  the  five  Officers  posted  at
8Johannesburg  but  there  is  no  communication  that  the  Officers  are
finding it difficult to work on the basis of such reduced salary.  The
salary  was  reduced  from  the  month  of  January,  2001,  though,  the
respondent-writ  petitioner  has  joined  only  on  21.09.2000 .   The
respondent never offered to seek repatriation to India and in fact sought
voluntary retirement on depositing of Rs. 10,00,000/- for further stay in
Johannesburg. It shows that there was no financial loss suffered by him
on account of reduction in salary, but actually, he found it lucrative to
resign from the service of the Bank and to stay in Johannesburg after
payment of substantial amount of Rs. 10,00,000/-. 
18.The salary has been fixed in terms of directions of the Government
of India, in respect of all Public Sector Banks keeping in view the Cost of
Living  Index  in  different  countries  and  making  adjustments  in  the
salaries according to the Cost of Living of each country.  The Cost of
Living in each country is separate and distinct and such factors have
been taken into consideration while fixing the salary on the basis of
Bulletin of Statistics published by U.N. in March, 2000.   The earlier
fixation of salary for Johannesburg was fixed by Working Group w.e.f.
01.01.1995  on  the  basis  of  Consumer  Price  Index  of  1992  as  per
International Financial, Statistics (IMF Publication - September, 1995).
The revised salary structure is not meant for any particular official but is
applicable to all Officers of Public Sector Banks posted abroad. 
19.The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent is that
when the respondent was deputed in June, 2001 the Cost of Living Index
as in March, 2000 was available, therefore, there was no reason to fix
9the salary on the basis of Consumer Price Index of the year 1995.  It has
come on record that the Bulletin of Statistics published by the U.N. in
March, 2000 was considered by the Standing Committee in its meeting
held on 15.01.2001.  The respondent was informed of his reduced salary
the very next day.  Therefore, the Cost of Living Index on the basis of
March, 2000 Report was considered in January, 2001.  Such decision
cannot be said to be arbitrary only because it was taken after about nine
months of the publication of the data. 
20.The reasoning given by the High Court that there is no privity of
contract of the respondent-writ petitioner with the Standing Committee
is not tenable.  The respondent-writ petitioner as an Officer of the Bank
is bound by the salary structure approved by the Bank for its Officers.
The decision of the Standing Committee is a part of the decision-making
in  respect  of  salary  payable  to  the  employees  of  the  Banks.   The
employee of a Bank has no right that he should be associated with the
decision-making process in respect of the fixation of salary.  However, if
the question of reasonableness of salary arises, then in exercise  of
power of judicial review, the Court may examine the decision-making
process.  In exercise of power of judicial review, we do not find any
infirmity in the decision of Standing Committee taken on 15.01.2001 in
pursuance to the direction of the Government of India issued under
Section 18 of the Act. 
21.Since, the salary has been fixed for all Officers of the Public Sector
Banks in a non-discriminatory manner keeping in view the Cost of Living
Index, we find that the High Court erred in law in setting aside the
10reduction in salary.  There is reasonable basis of reduction of salary. Still
further  there  was  no  promise  ever  made  to  the  respondent-writ
petitioner that his salary of US $ 1965 shall remain unchanged during
the  period  of  his  posting.   In  fact,  as  reproduced  above,  it  was
categorically  mentioned  that  the  salary  as  well  as  perquisites  are
subject to change from time to time.  Therefore, mere fact that the
salary  was  changed  subsequently,  it  will  not  confer  any  legally
enforceable right in favour of the respondent to challenge the same on
the ground that the same is arbitrary or unjust.  
22.The present appeal is allowed.  The order passed by the Bombay
High Court is set aside and the Writ Petition is dismissed with no order
as to costs.

 J U D G M E N T
R.SUBHASH REDDY, J.
1.The State of Maharashtra has preferred
this appeal aggrieved by the order  dated
13.06.2008,  passed  by  the  High  Court  of
Judicature at Bombay, in criminal Application
No. 4504 of 2006.
2.On 01.09.1998 a complaint was lodged by
one  Shivram,  who  was  examined  as  P.W.12
stating  that  on  29.08.1998  at  around
9 O'Clock he was doing work in Hanuman Water
Supply  Society,  sitting  at  Kalamma  Milk
Dairy.  At that time the loud speaker was
switched off.  When he came out of Milk Dairy
to know whey loud speaker was switched off,
he found  Ananda  Ganpati Rhatol, Shankar
Ganpati  Rhatol,  Yashvant  Shripati  Rhatol,
Shivaji  Bapu  Khot,  Rangrao  Piraji  Angaj,
Shankar Ganu Metil, Samadhan Shankar Metil,
Damodar Tukaram Raut, Ramesh Damodar Taut,
Dattatraya Vasant Rhatol, Baburao Dattatray
Rhatol,  Baburao  Jaysingh  Rhatol,  Ganpati
Krishna Powar, Hanumant Krishana Powar and
other persons  approaching towards him and
they had attacked and assaulted him. In the
said attack, he stated that he was injured
and  hospitalized.   Subsequently,  after
recovery, he lodged complaint on 01.09.1998,
based  on  which  FIR  No.  1165/1998  was
registered.   Based on the complaint lodged,3
investigation was made and the respondents
herein were charged for offences punishable
under Sections 143, 147, 323 read with 149,
325 of I.P.C. and 135 of Bombay Police Act.
After charge sheet was filed, case was tried
by the learned 5th Additional Sessions Judge,
Kolhapur.  Vide judgment dated 06.09.2005 all
the accused were acquitted of the charges
framed against them.    
3.The appellant-State has filed application
seeking  leave  to  prefer  appeal  as
contemplated under Section 378(3) of Cr.P.C.,
1973,  which  was  numbered  as  criminal
application No. 4504 of 2006.  The aforesaid
application  was rejected by impugned order
dated 13.06.2008 and the High Court declined
leave to appeal.  Hence this appeal by the
State.
4.We have heard learned counsel for the
State as well as the counsel appearing for
the  respondents-accused  and  perused  order4
dated 13.06.2008 and other material placed on
record.   In support of the case, a reliance
is placed by counsel for the appellant-State
on the judgment in  the case of State of
Maharashtra  vs.  Sujay  Mangesh  Poyarekar,
reported  in  (2008)  9  SCC  475.   In  the
aforesaid judgment, the scope of  Section
378(3), Cr.P.C. has been considered by this
Court.  The relevant paragraphs 20 and 21 of
the aforesaid judgment reads as under :
""20.  In  our  opinion,
however,  in  deciding  the
question  whether  requisite
leave should or should not be
granted, the High Court must
apply  its  mind,  consider
whether a  prima facie case
has been made out or arguable
points have been raised and
not  whether  the  order  of
acquittal would or would be
set aside.
21.It cannot be laid down
as an abstract proposition of
law of universal application
that each and every petition
seeking leave to prefer an
appeal against an order of
acquittal recorded by a trial
court must be allowed by the
appellate  court  and  every5
appeal must be admitted and
decided  on  merits.   But
minute  details  of  the
prosecution  evidence  and
refuse leave observing that
the  judgment  of  acquittal
recorded by the trial court
could  not  be  said  to  be
""perverse""  and,  hence,  no
leave should be granted."" 
5.Further,  we  have  noticed  from  the
impugned  order  that  while  rejecting  the
application, the High Court has stated that
medical evidence did not indicate any injury
on  the  back  or  on  the  thigh  of  the
complainant.   However, from the material
placed on record, it appears that the said,
finding in the order run contrary to the
medical evidence on record.  Dr. Yashwant who
was examined as P.W. 5, in his deposition,
categorically  stated  that  the  complainant
Shivram had sustained a fracture of left
tibia and there were also lacerated wounds.
The medical evidence documents were exhibited
as Exhibits 121 and 131.  The reason for
rejecting the application for leave to appeal6
run contrary to evidence on record.  In any
event, having perused the material on record,
we are of the view that, prima facie ,  a case
is made out by the State for grant of leave
to prefer appeal against the judgment and
order dated 06.05.2005, passed by the 5th
Additional  Sessions  Judge,  Kolhapur  in
Sessions Case No. 140 of 2000.  
6.We are also informed that there was a
cross  complaint  by  other  faction  in  the
village  relating to same date incident on
which basis a case was registered  and the
accused therein were tried in Sessions Case
No.83/1999.  The  accused  therein  were
convicted for offences under Section 143,
147, 307, 324, 427, 504, 395, 325, 337, 452
read with 149, 325 IPC.  It is stated that
appeal preferred against that judgment is
pending before the High Court.  As it is
stated that the two groups in the village
filed cross complaints and appeal arising out7
of one is pending before the High Court, we
are of the view that it is a fit case for
grant  of  leave  as  prayed  for  by  the
appellant-State.
7.For the aforesaid reason this appeal is
allowed and  impugned order dated 13.06.2008
is  set  aside.   Consequently,  application
filed before the High Court stands allowed.
The criminal appeal preferred by the State
challenging the acquittal in Sessions Case
No. 140 of 2000 shall be taken on file.
8.In appreciation of the contention raised
by the respective parties, we request the
High Court to take up the appeal in terms of
this order, as well as Criminal Appeal No.
849 of 2005 simultaneously and decide the
same expeditiously.  
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 197  OF 2019
(Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No. 3359 OF 2010)
   
9.Leave granted.
10.The  complainant  has  filed  criminal
Revision application No. 119 of 2006 before8
the High Court aggrieved by the order of
acquittal passed in Sessions Case No.140 of
2000.  The same is rejected on the basis of
the  impugned  order  passed  in  Criminal
Application No. 4504 of 2006.
11.We are of the view that as the impugned
order in Criminal Application No. 4504 of
2006 has already been set aside by this Court
in the appeal filed by the State, there is no
reason to reject the revision filed by the
complainant.   
12.Accordingly,  the  impugned  order  dated
21.01.2010 in Criminal revision application
No. 119 of 2006 is set aside and the matter
is remitted to the High Court for fresh
consideration,  to  decide  the  criminal
revision on its own merit.        
  
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 798 OF 2010         
CRIMINAL   APPEAL NO. 800 of 2010   
13.In view of order passed in the aforesaid
appeals, it is stated that no further orders9
are required to be passed in these appeals.
Accordingly, these appeals also disposed off.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 11343 OF 2017
[ @ SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO. 35215 OF 2016 ]
THE GENERAL MANAGER - OPERATIONS CHENNAI 
CONTAINER TERMINAL PVT LTD & ANR.   Appellant(s)
                                VERSUS
K. THIRUTHANIKUMARAN & ANR.                   Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
KURIAN, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.The  appellants  are  before  this  Court,
aggrieved by the order dated 03.11.2016, passed
by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ
Appeal No. 623 of 2016.  The issue pertains to
the disputes between the respondent-workman and
the appellant-Management.
3.Though this case has a chequered history, in
the nature of the order we propose to pass, it is
not necessary to refer to all those aspects,
particularly  having  been  benefitted  by  the
mediated  assistance  rendered  by  Mr.  Sanjay
Parikh, learned counsel, who graciously accepted2
the request made by the Court.
4.The  relationship  between  the
respondent-workman and the appellant-Management
has not been smooth and it has been strained to
the extent that the Management finally terminated
the respondent-workman from service.  There are
several disputes with regard to his termination
and one case, being OS No. 242 of 2016 is now
pending before the City Civil Court at Chennai
and the proceedings under the Industrial Disputes
Act are also said to be pending before the
Conciliation Officer.
5.Having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
respondent-workman is only around 45 years and he
is able to work elsewhere and having regard to
the  background  of  the  strained  relationship
between the parties, we are of the view that it
is in the interests of both the parties to give a
quietus to the disputes.  We are informed that
towards the gratuity and provident fund, the
respondent-workman is entitled to get an amount
of  Rs.  9.10  Lakhs.   Now,  when  the
employer-employee relationship is coming to an3
end once and for all, we are of the view that the
respondent-workman should also be appropriately
compensated.
6.Having heard the learned counsel appearing on
both sides and having heard Mr.Thiruthanikumaran,
the respondent-workman, who is present before us,
we are of the view that in full and final
settlement  of  the  entire  claims  of  the
respondent-workman, the appellant - Management
should pay an amount of Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees
Twenty Five Lakhs).  This payment is inclusive of
the gratuity and provident fund or any other
claim of the respondent.  In other words, the
respondent-workman shall not be entitled to raise
any  further  claim  on  any  counts  from  the
appellant-Management.
7.In view of the order passed above, it is not
necessary  to  continue  the  civil  suit,  being
O.S.No. 242 of 2016, pending before the City
Civil  Court,  Chennai,  which  is,  accordingly,
struck off from its files.  The Registry shall
communicate a copy of this Judgment to the City
Civil Court, Chennai forthwith.4
8.The pending proceedings between the parties
under the Industrial Disputes Act or any other
forum shall also stand terminated.  We direct
both the parties not to indulge in any other
litigation, either civil or criminal, in respect
of the employer-employee relationship without the
leave of this court.
9.Towards  the  litigation  expenses,  the
respondent-workman shall also be entitled to a
further amount of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty
Thousand).   Hence,  the  total  amount  of
Rs.25,50,000/-  (Rupees  Twenty  Five  Lakhs  and
Fifty Thousand) will be credited to the bank
account of the respondent-workman within 10 days
from today.
  
10.With the above observations and directions,
this appeal is disposed of.

 Leave granted. 
2. These two appeals have been filed against judgment 
of the Allahabad High Court dated 06.10.2015 dismissing 
the Writ Petition No.29473 of 1999 and order dated 
09.03.2016 rejecting Review Application No.421500 of 
2015 filed by the appellant. 
3. Brief facts of the case necessary to be noticed 
for deciding the appeals are: 
 The appellant claims to be appointed on 02.08.1991 
by the Management of Jawaharlal Nehru Smarak Post 
Graduate College ( Affiliated to Gorakhpur University, 2 
 
Gorakhpur. The appellant’s case is that an 
advertisement was issued on 22.06.1991 in the 
newspaper- Hindi Dainik, Gorakhpur in response to which 
he applied for the post of Professor Defence Studies. 
The Registrar of the University nominated an expert for 
appointment. By its letter dated 09.10.1991,  based on 
the recommendation of the Selection Committee dated 
22.07.1991 the appointment of the appellant was 
approved on ad hoc basis by the University for a period 
of six months or until a regular teacher is selected 
by the Commission, whichever was earlier. By a 
subsequent letter dated 29 .11.1991 ad hoc appointment 
of appellant was re- approved until a candidate duly 
selected by the Selection Commission takes charge on 
the post. The appellant’s further case is that by 
letter dated 09.02.1996 a post of Lecturer Military 
Science was created in the College. Appellant’s case 
was that he received salary from the College till 
April, 1998  and thereafter due to the dispute between 
Committee  of Management his salary was not paid. Writ 
Petition No.29473 of 1999 was filed by the appellant 
in the High Court seeking a writ of mandamus commanding 3 
 
the respondents to pay salary to the petitioner on 
month to month basis as Lecturer,  Military Science and 
not to interfere in the functioning of the petitioner 
as Lecturer, Military Science. An interim order was 
passed on 20.07.1999 in pursuance of which salary was 
started being paid to the appellant.  
4. A counter- affidavit was filed by Assistant 
Director of Education in the writ petition where the 
claim of the appellant was refuted and it was mentioned 
that the claim of the appellant had already been 
rejected by order dated 28.07.2005.  It was pleaded that 
although appellant claimed his appointment as ad hoc 
Lecturer, Military Science on 02.08.1991 whereas post 
for Military Science was created only on 09.02.1996.  
The State has no liability to pay salary i n view of the 
provision of the U.P. State Universities Act,  1973, 
Section 60 E and 60A(vi).  It was also pleaded that the 
petitioner was not appointed following the due 
procedure. The writ petition was dismissed by the 
Division Bench vide its judgment dated 06.10.2015. The 
High Court referred to paragraph 3( h) and 3(i) of the 
counter- affidavit and paragraph 6 of the rejoinder-4 
 
affidavit of the petitioner.  The High Court held that 
the appointment made without advertisement is void. 
Challenging the order dated 06.10.2015 an SLP was filed 
by the appellant in this Court. The SLP was dismissed 
by this Court on 30.11.2015 by following order: 
“Learned counsel for the petitioner says 
that there is an error apparent on the face 
of the record inasmuch as there is no 
paragraph 3(i) in the counter affidavit filed 
by the State Government nor is there any 
paragraph 6 of the rejoinder affidavit, as 
quoted in the impugned order. He says that 
he would like to file a review petition.  
Liberty granted.  
The special leave petition is dismissed 
as withdrawn.  
In case, the review petition is 
dismissed, the petitioner is at liberty to 
challenge the impugned order before this 
Court.” 
 
5. After the above order of this Court dated 
30.11.2015 the appellant filed a review application in 
the High Court. The review application has been 
dismissed by the High Court by a non- speaking order 
dated 09.03.2016 . The appellant aggrieved by the order 
dismissing the review application as well as the main 5 
 
judgment dated 06.10.2015 dismissing the writ petition 
has filed these two appeals. 
6. Shri Vishwajit Singh, learned counsel for the 
appellant submits that the writ petition was dismissed 
by the High Court by referring to pleadings in some 
other writ petition. In the writ petition filed by the 
appellant, counter- affidavit was filed by one Dr. R.R. 
Yadav which is brought on the record of these appeals 
as Annexure- P14. In the counter- affidavit, there are 
no paragraphs 3( h) and 3(i) whereas the High Court in 
the impugned judgment dated 06.10.2015 referred to 
paragraphs 3( h) and 3(i) of the counter- affidavit and 
reply of the said paragraphs of the counter- affidavit 
in paragraph 6 of the rejoinder- affidavit as quoted in 
the impugned judgment was different.  
7. Learned counsel submits that in the review 
application appellant has taken grounds pointing out 
apparent error but the review application was rejected 
without considering the said grounds. Learned counsel 
for the appellant submits that before the appointment 
of the appellant vacancy was advertised,  copies of one 6 
 
of the advertisements  dated 22.06.1991 in Hindi Dainik 
is filed as Annexure P- 1. He submits that appellant has 
already filed a writ petition in the High Court for his 
regularization being Writ Petition No.1704(SB) of 2013 
which is pending at Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High 
Court. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that 
the appellant has been working for more than two 
decades the High Court committed an error in dismissing 
the writ petition without adverting to the facts and  
pleadings of the appellant’s writ petition.  
8. Learned counsel for the State refuting the 
submission of the appellant contends that the 
appointment of the appellant was not made following 
procedure as prescribed in law. He submits that the 
High Court has rightly dismissed the writ petition of 
the appellant.  
9. We have considered the submissions of the parties 
and perused the records. 
10. The appellant claims ad hoc appointment on the post 
of Lecturer,  Military Science in a Post Graduate 
College Affiliated to the Gorakhpur University. The 7 
 
submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is 
that paragraphs of the counter- affidavit i.e. 3( h) and 
3(i) as well as paragraph 6 of the rejoinder- affidavit 
in the writ petition which has been referred to and 
relied by the High Court for dismissing the writ 
petition are not present in the counter- affidavit filed 
to the writ petition of the appellant and the 
rejoinder- affidavit filed by the appellant. The 
appellant has brought on the record the copy of 
counter- affidavit as Annexure- P14. In the counter-
affidavit has paragraph 3 upto sub-paragraph ‘g.’ only. 
There are no paragraphs 3( h) and 3(i) in the counter-
affidavit of Dr. R.R. Yadav, Assistant Director in the 
Directorate of Higher Education, U.P., Allahabad filed 
in the writ petition filed by the appellant. In the 
judgment of the High Court paragraph 6 of the 
rejoinder- affidavit has been extracted which was 
claimed to be reply to paragraph 3( h) and 3(i). The 
appellant filed rejoinder- affidavit in his writ 
petition which is brought on record as Annexure- P15. 8 
 
In paragraph 6 of the rejoinder- affidavit filed by the 
appellant following has been pleaded by the appellant: 
“6. That in reply to the contents of paragraph 
No.3(c) of the counter- affidavit it is 
submitted that the petitioner was appointed 
on 06.08.1991 as Lecturer in Military Science 
and against the said post the petitioner was 
adjusted and the petitioner was continuing 
her salary and getting the salary and all 
emoluments including the G.P.F. and financial 
approval has been granted by the Respondent 
No.1 For kind consideration of this Hon’ble 
Court a true copy of the order of financial 
approval dated 12.11.2001 granted by the 
Respondent No.1 is being filed herewith and 
is marked as Annexure No.R.A.- 2 to this  
Rejoinder Affidavit.” 
 
11. The paragraph 6 of the rejoinder- affidavit as 
quoted in the impugned judgment dated 06.10.2015 is 
entirely different. As noted  above, before this Court 
an SLP was filed by the appellant in which the above 
argument was addressed and t his Court dismissed the SLP 
by permitting the appellant to withdraw the SLP to file 
a review petition before the High Court. A review 
application being No.421500 of 2015 was filed where 9 
 
following grounds apart from  other grounds have been 
taken: 
“1. Because there is an error apparent on the 
face of the record inasmuch as there is 
no paragraph 3(i) in the counter-
affidavit filed by the Respondent No.01 
and 02 jointly nor is there any paragraph 
6 of the rejoinder- affidavit, as quoted 
in the impugned order dated 06.10.2015. 
2. Because there is an error apartment on 
the fact of the petitioner and issue date 
of appointment letter did not match with 
the record of the writ petition No.29473 
of 1999 as mentioned in impugned order 
dated 06.10.2015. 
3. Because it is relevant to state here 
before the Hon’ble Court that the 
petitioner’s writ petition No.29473 of 
1999 disposed by the Hon’ble Court 
without hearing and examine the facts and 
evidence of the petition. The impugned 
order dated 06.10.2015 is the same copy 
of order passed on 06.10.2015 in writ 
petition No.29474 of 1999 (Dr. Triyogi 
Nath vs. Director of Higher Education & 
others), while date & events regarding 
the appointment and contents of counter-
affidavit, rejoinder- affidavit & 
supplementary affidavit are absolutely 
different.” 
 
12. Although above grounds specifically were taken by 
the appellant in the review application but the High 
Court by non -speaking order rejected the review 10 
 
application on 09.03.2016. As per the liberty earlier 
granted to the appellant he has again come up in these 
appeals challenging both the orders of the High Court.  
13. From the records it appears that along with the 
Writ Petition No. 29473 of 1999 filed by the appellant 
another writ petition being No.29474 of 1999 (Dr. 
Triyogi Nath vs. Director of Higher Education & others) 
was connected and heard. It appears while deciding writ 
petition of the appellant the paragraph 3(h) and 3(i) 
of the counter- affidavit and paragraph 6 in Writ 
Petition No.29474 of 1999 has been referred to.   
14. The High Court unless looks into the facts of the 
appellant’s case and pleadings made therein the writ 
petition could not have been decided. It is relevant 
to notice that the error committed by the High Court 
in deciding the writ petition on 06.10.2015 was brought 
into the notice of the High Court by filing detailed 
review application after withdrawing SLP from this 
Court but the review application was dismissed by non-
speaking order without adverting to the specific 
grounds raised in the review application. We are of the 11 
 
view that the judgment of the High Court deciding W rit 
Petition No.29473 of 1999 without referring to the 
pleadings in the writ petition i.e. pleadings in the 
counter- affidavit and rejoinder- affidavit,  cannot be 
upheld.  
15. We are of the view that ends of justice would be 
served in setting aside the judgment and order of the 
High court dated 06.10.2015 and 09.03.2016 and 
remitting the matter to the High Court to decide the 
writ petition afresh on the basis of the pleadings on 
the record. We make it clear that in the facts and 
circumstances of the case we have neither adverted to 
the merits of the claim of the appellant nor have 
expressed any opinion on the merits of the claim. The 
High Court shall now proceed to decide the writ 
petition afresh on merits in accordance with law. It 
goes without saying that claim of petitioner for 
payment of salary or claim for regularization as 
pending in W.P.No.1704(SB) of 2013 shall be dependent 
on the outcome of Writ Petition No.29473 of 1999. The 12 
 
judgment dated 06.10.2015 and order dated 09.03.2016 
are set aside. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1930 OF 2008
 
CHRISOMAR CORPORATION          …APPELLANT
VERSUS
MJR STEELS PRIVATE LIMITED & ANR. ...RESPONDENT
 J U D G M E N T 
R.F. Nariman, J.
1.The present appeal raises several interesting questions
which arise in admiralty law. The vessel, M.V. Nikolaos-S, was
owned by one Third Element Enterprises, a Cyprus company,
and was flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus.  The plaintiff
in the admiralty suit, who is the appellant before us, supplied
bunkers and other necessaries to the said vessel at the port of
Durban on terms and conditions agreed between the parties in
November, 1999.  According to the plaintiff, the bunkers were
1received  by  the  master  of  the  vessel  and  services  were
rendered to the vessel as acknowledged by the master. The
plaintiff raised invoices on 26.11.1999 for US$ 94,611.25 which
have not yet been paid. 
2.When the vessel docked in the port of Haldia, the plaintiff
filed admiralty suit No.1 of 2000 in the Calcutta High Court
praying for an arrest of the vessel because, according to the
plaintiff, the necessaries supplied to the vessel would not only
amount to a maritime claim but would also be a maritime lien on
the vessel.  By an order dated 6.1.2000, the vessel was so
arrested but nobody came forward for release of the vessel at
that point of time.  It is only on 25.1.2000 that learned counsel
appearing  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff  approached  the  learned
admiralty  Judge  expressing  the  plaintiff’s  intention  not  to
proceed with the application for arrest as, according to him, the
parties had reached an out of court settlement.  The order
passed on 25.1.2000 reads as follows:-
“The  Court  by  an  order  dated  January  6,  2000
directed that the vessel known as M.V.Nikolaos – S
was to be arrested.  On the returnable date no one
appeared  on  behalf  of  the  respondents.  The
2directions for affidavits had been given on January
10, 2000.  Today when the matter was called on for
hearing,  counsel  appearing  for  the  petitioner
submitted that an out of court settlement has been
reached between the parties and the petitioner was
not inclined to proceed with the matter any further.
For these reasons, this application is dismissed for
non prosecution. 
All interim orders are vacated. 
The vessel shall cease to be under arrest as of
now.” 
3.It is important at this stage to advert to the agreement that
was entered into on 18.1.2000.  Since both sides have argued
extensively on the aforesaid agreement, it is necessary to set it
out completely. The said agreement reads as follows:-
“AGREEMENT GUARANTEE
In  Piraeus  and  at  the  offices  of  “LALLIS
OUTSINOS  ANAGNOSTOPOULOS”  Lawyers
Maritime  Consultants  of  100,  Kololotroni  Street,
Piraeus, this Tuesday the 18th January 2000, by and
between:
A.CHRISOMAR CORPORATION, a company duly
established  and  operating  under  the  laws  of
Liberia,  maintaining  an  office  in  Greece  (5
Solomou  Str.  Kifissia)  (hereinafter  called
Chrisomar), duly represented, for the purpose of
this  agreement  by  its  authorized  lawyer  Mr.
Dimitrios Voutsinos,
3B.THIRD  ELEMENT  ENTERPRISES  LTD,  a
company duly established and operating under
the  laws  of  Cyprus  (hereinafter  called  “THE
SHIPOWNERS”),  duly  represented  for  the
purpose of this agreement by the President of
the Board of Directors, Mr. Sotirios Soulkas, who
also  declared  that  he  has  the  necessary
authorization and capacity to bind the company
to this agreement by his sole signature. 
C.Sotirios Soukas, of 145 Filonos Str, Piraeus, the
following were stated and agreed.
WHEREAS
1.The shipowners are the legal owners of the Cyprus flag
vessel  Nikolaos  S,  Int.  Sign:  P 3  KT  6  (“the  vessel”)
managed in Greece by Suter Shipping and Trading Ltd.
2.Chrisomar has sold and delivered to the vessel in the port
of Durban a certain quantity of bunkers, on or about 26th
November, 1999, Chrisomar has issued its invoice no.
99232/15.12.1999  for  the  amount  of  USD  94,611.25,
payable on 26th November, 1999 (Copy of the invoice is
attached herewith as app. I). 
3.The owners have failed to pay the amount of the above
invoice  by  the  26th November  1999  and  consequently,
Chrisomar arrested the vessel in the port of Haldia, India
for security of the above claim.
THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS
1.The  shipowners  hereby  confirm  that  they  owe  to
Chrisomar USD 104,688.60, analysed as follows: USD
94,611.25  for  the  invoice  amount  +  USD  2,177.35  for
interest accrued + USD 7,900.00 for legal costs.
2.The  shipowners,  through  their  President  Mr.  Sotirios
Soukas, represent to Chrisomar that (a) their vessel is
4due  to  be  chartered  out  for  a  voyage  from  Bangkok,
Thailand to ports of West Africa as against a freight of
about  USD  35.00  per  metric  ton  of  cargo;  (b)  that  if
Chrisomar releases their vessel from the above arrest
shall be able to proceed to Bangkok for loading and to
perform  the  intended  charter  voyage;  (c)  that  the
shipowners as soon as their vessel is released from its
arrest  by  Chrisomar  shall  include  in  their  recap  and
charter party with the intended charterers of their vessel a
clause  that  part  of  the  freight  amounting  to  USD
104,668.60  shall  be  paid  directly  by  the  charterers  to
Chrisomar’s bank account as follows:
ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK
21, Akti Miaouli, 18535 Piraeus
Swift: GRNDGRAA,
A/C No. 815142 USD 40632
In favour of Chrisomar Corp.
3.The above recap shall be faxed by the shipowners to
Chrisomar one (1) working day after its conclusion.
4.The  shipowners  will  not  sell  their  vessel  prior  to  the
satisfaction of Chrisomar’s above claim and shall provide
Chrisomar with a report by fax of the movements of their
vessel every five (5) days. 
5.The  above  payment  shall  be  made  in  full  and  final
settlement of Chrisomar’s above claim per capital and
costs.
6.If,  for  any  reason  the  above  amount  is  not  paid  to
Chrisomar within ten (10) working days after the ships
sailing  from  the  port  of  loading  Bangkok  or,  the
shipowners are in breach of any of the representations
and obligations set out in paras 2, 3 and 4 above then
Chrisomar will be entitled to take all the appropriate legal
5steps including the arrest of the vessel for recovering the
above  amount  or  any  higher  one  which  they  may  be
entitled to.
7.Sotirios Soukas hereby guarantees to Chrisomar and in
favour of the shipowner the due payment of the above
amount, working the right of division and exclusion i.e. he
admits that he will pay amounts due to Chrisomar without
the  latter  having  first  to  enforce  its  claim  against  the
shipowners and their vessel.
8.If the vessel is lost, for any reason or if the mortgagee
bank  or  any  other  claimant  arrests  the  vessel  before
reaching Bangkok and as a result, the shipowners are
unable  to  proceed  for  loading  to  Bangkok,  and  thus
execute  the  above  stated  charter  voyage,  the  above
obligations  of  the  guarantor  shall  cease  to  exist  but
Chrisomar will maintain its rights of recovery only against
the  shipowners  and  the  vessel  but  not  against  the
guarantor.
9.This agreement is subject to Greek law and the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Piraeus Courts. ”
4.It appears that nothing in the meanwhile happened. At no
point of time did the vessel sail for the port of Bangkok – it
remained continuously in Haldia.  It is only on 2.5.2000 that the
vessel was re-arrested.  The Court recorded that no payment
had yet been made and that the claim of the plaintiff continued
to remain unsatisfied.  It is this re-arrest that is the bone of
contention between the parties in the present matter. 
65.A written  statement  was filed on behalf of respondent
no.1, MJR Steels, an Indian company who allegedly purchased
the  vessel  from  one  Fairsteel  Corporation,  Singapore.
Apparently, an agreement was entered into between Fairsteel
and respondent no.1 on 21.1.2000.  The written statement filed
by respondent no. 1 alleged: 
“The said vessel was originally owned by The Third
Element Enterprises Shipping Ltd.  Third Element
Enterprises Shipping Ltd. sold and transferred the
said  vessel  to  Eastern  Wealth  Investment  Ltd.
Eastern Wealth Investment Ltd. sold and transferred
the said vessel to Fairsteel Corporation.  Fairsteel
Corporation sold and transferred the said vessel to
this defendant.  This defendant acquired the right,
title or interest in respect of the said vessel from the
said Fairsteel Corporation.”
6.The  learned  single  Judge  by  his  judgment  and  order
dated 28.4.2005 listed as many as seven issues and adverted
to the fact that three witnesses were called on behalf of the
plaintiffs, who not only deposed and were cross-examined, but
also produced various documents.  The defendants, however,
did not produce any witness but tendered as their evidence six
exhibits  which  were  produced  only  through  the  plaintiff’s
7witnesses. 
7.According  to  the  learned  single  Judge,  the  order  of
25.1.2000 made it clear that suit No.1 of 2000 was kept alive
and  remained  alive  on  the  date  of  the  re-arrest,  namely,
2.5.2000. All that was done by the order dated 2.5.2000 was to
recall the order dated 25.1.2000, and when that was done, the
original order of arrest was automatically revived.  This being
the case, it is clear that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover
their dues.  The learned single Judge further went on to hold
that respondent no.1’s claim that ownership had changed and
that they had become owners of the vessel in April, 2000, was
not conclusively proved.  The single Judge referred, among
other documents, to a suit filed by respondent no.1 against
Fairsteel  Corporation  on  9.5.2000  in  which  respondent  no.1
prayed for a decree for rescission of the agreement for sale
dated 21.1.2000, as also for cancellation of the said agreement,
and perpetual injunction restraining Fairsteel from claiming any
money under the Letter of Credit furnished by respondent no.1.
It recorded that the said suit was dismissed for non-prosecution
8on 12.10.2004, and from the averments made in the said suit, it
was  clear  that  there  was  no  concluded  sale  in  favour  of
respondent no.1.
8.An  appeal  to  the  Division  Bench  by  respondent  no.1
however  succeeded.  By  the  impugned  judgment  dated
13.9.2006, it was held that the plaintiff’s first witness admitted
the fact that the vessel’s ownership changed hands and that on
the date of re-arrest, i.e. 2.5.2000, it was respondent no.1 who
was the owner.  It also examined various documents to arrive at
the conclusion that the vessel physically changed hands on
15.4.2000 and payments under the Letter of Credit were made
pursuant to the agreement dated 21.1.2000 on 26.4.2000.  The
Division  Bench  further  went  on  to  hold  that  though  the
allegation as regards the successive transfers of title had not
been proved by the defendant, the said fact would make no
difference.  It also went on to hold that there could be a good
title by estoppel. The Division Bench further went on to apply
Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 to the out of court
settlement dated 18.1.2000 and stated that as there was a
9novatio of the original agreement in law, the original cause of
action  pleaded  in  admiralty  Suit  No.  1  of  2000  no  longer
subsisted. Therefore, the claim made in the suit was held to
have been abandoned when the settlement dated 18.1.2000
was acted upon.  In this view of the case, the Division Bench
reversed the single Judge’s decision and held that the suit was
liable to be dismissed on all these grounds. 
9.Shri Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf  of  the  appellants,  has  argued  before  us  that  the
agreement dated 18.1.2000 would not amount to a novatio of
the  original  agreement.  According  to  him,  the  original
agreement continued and was in fact enforced by the second
order of arrest dated 2.5.2000. According to him, the right that
was vested in the appellant on 5.1.2000, i.e. the date of the
institution of the suit, is alone material, and it is on that date,
and not the date of arrest on 2.5.2000, that the ownership of the
vessel  has  to  be  seen.   For  this  purpose,  he  cited  certain
English precedents.  He also cited an American judgment to
buttress his submission that the present was a case not merely
10of  a  maritime  claim  but  also  of  a  maritime  lien  in  that
necessaries supplied to the vessel would amount to a maritime
lien.  According  to  him,  in  any  event,  on  facts,  the  Division
Bench was completely wrong in arriving at a conclusion that
there  was  a  concluded  sale  in  April,  2000  in  favour  of
respondent no.1 inasmuch as several documents produced by
the plaintiff’s witnesses would show that no such sale had, in
fact, taken place.
10.Shri  Banerjee,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  on
behalf  of  the  respondents,  has  countered  each  of  these
submissions.  According to Shri Banerjee, the Division Bench is
absolutely correct.  The present is the case of enforcement of a
maritime  claim,  but  there  is  no  maritime  lien  in  law  for
necessaries supplied to the vessel.  This being the case, it is
important to know who the owner of the vessel is on the date of
arrest, i.e. on 2.5.2000.  If the owner is respondent no.1, then a
claim for necessaries against the original owner, Third Element,
on the date of institution of the suit would not lie against the
respondent on the date of arrest.  According to learned counsel,
11English authorities cited by Shri Divan would not apply to the
present  case  as  in  England  there  is  a  completely  different
procedure for arresting a vessel. A writ of summons is issued
under Order 53 of the U.K. Civil Procedure Code for service
outside the jurisdiction of the court which is kept alive for a
period of six months.  Further, according to learned counsel,
Section 62 of the Contract Act is squarely attracted inasmuch
as  the  settlement  dated  18.1.2000  completely  replaced  the
original agreement as a result of which the original cause of
action pleaded in the suit has disappeared.  Learned counsel
also painstakingly took us through various documents to show
that the sale of the vessel to respondent no.1 had indeed taken
place in April, 2000 and that, therefore, on the date of arrest,
i.e. 2.5.2000, since his client was the owner of the vessel, the
amounts could not be recovered from respondent no.1. 
11.Admiralty law in England, as was held by Lord Halsbury in
Currie v.  M’Knight 1897 AC 97, is derived from the laws of
Oleron1 and other ancient maritime codes like the Rhodian Sea
1 The rolls of Oleron are associated with the island of Oleron, off the coast of 
Western France, which was the site of an ancient maritime court associated with a seaman’s 
guild of the Atlantic. In England, they were promulgated by Eleanor of Aquitaine, wife of 
Henry II, as vice-regent for her son King Richard I, while the latter was fighting the Saracens 
12Law, the Basilika, the Assizes of Jerusalem, the Baltic Laws of
Wisbuy and the Hanseatic Code. In England, the common law
courts could not give effective redress to cases which arose in
admiralty, which were then left to the jurisdiction of specialist
admiralty Judges. By the 18th Century, the admiralty jurisdiction
had fallen into “a feeble and neglected condition, and for long
its proceedings excited no attention” 2. The Admiralty Court Act,
1840 was the first of a series of statutes extending and defining
the jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty in England.  This
was  followed  by  the  1861  Admiralty  Court  Act  and  various
subsequent  enactments  which  were  consolidated  by  the
Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925.  By the
Administration of Justice Act of 1956, the admiralty jurisdiction
of the High Court was further widened and the Supreme Court
Act of 1981 now defines what the admiralty jurisdiction of the
High Court in England is.  
on the Third Crusade. King Henry VIII later published these rolls as, “The judgment of the 
sea, of Masters, of Mariners and Merchants, and all their doings”. They are expressly 
included in the compilation of English admiralty law, the “ Black Book of the Admiralty”.
2 See, Roscoe’s Admiralty Practice, 5th edn. at Pg. 14.
1312.Insofar as our law is concerned, the admiralty law of the
chartered  High  Courts  has  historically  been  traced  to  the
charters  of  1774  and  1798  as  subsequently  extended  and
clarified by the Letters Patents of 1823, 1862 and 1865. The
Admiralty Court Act, 1840 and 1861, and the Colonial Courts of
Admiralty  Act,  1890  and  1891  essentially  stated  what  the
admiralty  law  in  this  country  is,  and  these  enactments
continued as existing laws under Article 372 of the Constitution
of India. Some of the relevant provisions of these Acts are set
out hereinbelow:-
“Admiralty Court Act, 1840  
6. The court in certain cases may adjudicate, etc. —
The High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction
to decide all claims and demands whatsoever in the
nature  of  salvage  for  services  rendered  to  or
damage received by any ship or seagoing vessel or
in the nature of towage, or for necessaries supplied
to  any  foreign  ship  or  seagoing  vessel,  and  to
enforce the payment thereof, whether such ship or
vessel may have been within the body of a country,
or upon the high seas, at the time when the services
were rendered or damage received, or necessaries
furnished, in respect of which such claim is made.
Admiralty Court Act, 1861
145. As to claims for necessaries .—The High Court of
Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim for
necessaries supplied to any ship elsewhere than in
the  port  to  which  the  ship  belongs,  unless  it  is
shown to the satisfaction of the court that at the time
of the institution of the cause any owner or part-
owner of the ship is domiciled in England or Wales:
Provided  always,  that  if  in  any  such  cause  the
plaintiff do not recover twenty pounds, he shall not
be  entitled  to  any  costs,  charges,  or  expenses
incurred  by  him  therein,  unless  the  judge  shall
certify that the cause was a fit one to be tried in the
said Court.
Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890
2. Colonial Courts of Admiralty .—(1) Every court of
law in a British possession, which is for the time
being  declared  in  pursuance  of  this  Act  to  be  a
Court of Admiralty, or which, if no such declaration
is in force in the possession, has therein original
unlimited  civil  jurisdiction,  shall  be  a  Court  of
Admiralty, with the jurisdiction in this Act mentioned,
and  may  for  the  purpose  of  that  jurisdiction,
exercise all the powers which it possesses for the
purpose of its other civil jurisdiction and such Court
in reference to the jurisdiction conferred by this Act
is  in  this  Act  referred  to  as  a  Colonial  Court  of
Admiralty. …
(2) The jurisdiction of a Colonial Court of Admiralty
shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be over
the like places, persons, matters, and things, as the
admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England,
whether  existing  by  virtue  of  any  statute  or
otherwise and the Colonial Court of Admiralty may
15exercise such jurisdiction in like manner and to as
full an extent as the High Court in England, and
shall  have  the  same  regard  as  that  Court  to
international law and the comity of nations.
Colonial Courts of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891
2. Appointment of  Colonial Courts  of Admiralty .—
The following courts of unlimited civil jurisdiction are
hereby declared to be Colonial Courts of Admiralty,
namely:
(1) the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in
Bengal,
(2) the High Court of Judicature at Madras, and
(3) the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.”
13.The Republic of India has finally woken up to the need for
updating  its  admiralty  law.  The  Admiralty  (Jurisdiction  and
Settlement of Maritime Claims) Act, 2017 has been made by
Parliament and has received the assent of the President on
9.8.2017, though it has not yet been brought into force.  In this
Act, “maritime claim” is defined in Section 2(1)(f) as being a
claim referred to in Section 4 and a “maritime lien” is defined in
sub-section (g) of 2(1) as follows:
“2. Definitions 
(1) In this Act,—
16(g) “maritime lien” means a maritime claim against
the owner, demise charterer, manager or operator of
the vessel referred to in clauses (a) to (e) of sub-
section (1) of section 9, which shall continue to exist
under sub-section (2) of that section;”
Section 4 reads as follows:
“4. Maritime Claim  
(1) The High Court may exercise jurisdiction to hear
and determine any question on a maritime claim,
against any vessel, arising out of any— 
(a) dispute regarding the possession or ownership
of a vessel or the ownership of any share therein; 
(b) dispute between the co-owners of a vessel as to
the employment or earnings of the vessel; 
(c) mortgage or a charge of the same nature on a
vessel; 
(d) loss or damage caused by the operation of a
vessel; 
(e) loss of life or personal injury occurring whether
on land or on water, in direct connection with the
operation of a vessel; 
(f)  loss  or  damage  to  or  in  connection  with  any
goods; 
(g) agreement relating to the carriage of goods or
passengers on board a vessel, whether contained in
a charter party or otherwise; 
(h)  agreement  relating  to  the  use  or  hire  of  the
vessel,  whether  contained  in  a  charter  party  or
otherwise; 
(i) salvage services, including, if applicable, special

17respect  of  a  vessel  which  by  itself  or  its  cargo
threatens damage to the environment; 
(j) towage; 
(k) pilotage; 
(l)  goods, materials, perishable or non-perishable
provisions,  bunker  fuel,  equipment  (including
containers),  supplied  or  services  rendered  to  the
vessel for its operation, management, preservation
or  maintenance  including  any  fee  payable  or
leviable; 
(m) construction, reconstruction, repair, converting
or equipping of the vessel; 
(n) dues in connection with any port, harbour, canal,
dock  or  light  tolls,  other  tolls,  waterway  or  any
charges of similar kind chargeable under any law for
the time being in force; 
(o) claim by a master or member of the crew of a
vessel or their heirs and dependents for wages or
any sum due out of wages or adjudged to be due
which  may  be  recoverable  as  wages  or  cost  of
repatriation or social insurance contribution payable
on their behalf or any amount an employer is under
an obligation to pay to a person as an employee,
whether the obligation arose out of a contract of
employment  or  by  operation  of  a  law  (including
operation of a law of any country) for the time being
in  force,  and  includes  any  claim  arising  under  a
manning and crew agreement relating to a vessel,
notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions
of sections 150 and 151 of the Merchant Shipping
Act, 1958; 
(p) disbursements incurred on behalf of the vessel
or its owners; 
(q) particular average or general average; 
18(r) dispute arising out of a contract for the sale of
the vessel; 
(s) insurance premium (including mutual insurance
calls) in respect of the vessel, payable by or on
behalf of the vessel owners or demise charterers;
(t) commission, brokerage or agency fees payable
in respect of the vessel by or on behalf of the vessel
owner or demise charterer; 
(u)  damage  or  threat  of  damage  caused  by  the
vessel  to  the  environment,  coastline  or  related
interests; measures taken to prevent, minimise, or
remove  such  damage;  compensation  for  such
damage;  costs  of  reasonable  measures  for  the
restoration of the environment actually undertaken
or to be undertaken; loss incurred or likely to be
incurred  by  third  parties  in  connection  with  such
damage; or any other damage, costs, or loss of a
similar nature to those identified in this clause; 
(v) costs or expenses relating to raising, removal,
recovery, destruction or the rendering harmless of a
vessel  which  is  sunk,  wrecked,  stranded  or
abandoned, including anything that is or has been
on  board  such  vessel,  and  costs  or  expenses
relating to the preservation of an abandoned vessel
and maintenance of its crew; and 
(w) maritime lien. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of clause (q), the
expressions  “particular  average”  and  “general
average”  shall  have  the  same  meanings  as
assigned to them in sub-section (1) of section 64
and sub-section (2) of section 66 respectively of the
Marine Insurance Act, 1963. 
(2) While exercising jurisdiction under sub-section
(1),  the  High  Court  may  settle  any  account
outstanding and unsettled between the parties in
19relation to a vessel, and direct that the vessel, or
any share thereof, shall be sold, or make such other
order as it may think fit. 
(3) Where the High Court orders any vessel to be
sold,  it  may  hear  and  determine  any  question
arising as to the title to the proceeds of the sale. 
(4)  Any  vessel  ordered  to  be  arrested  or  any
proceeds of a vessel on sale under this Act shall be
held  as  security  against  any  claim  pending  final
outcome of the admiralty proceeding.”
14.Under Section 5 of the Act, the High Court may order for
the arrest of a vessel which is within its jurisdiction for the
purpose of providing security against a maritime claim.  Under
Section 6 of the said Act, the High Court may also exercise
admiralty jurisdiction by an order in personam in respect of the
maritime claims referred to in Section 4.  Section 9 of the Act
sets out the inter se priority of maritime liens, but in so doing
also informs us that they are restricted to five subject matters
only. Section 9 reads as follows:
“Sec. 9 Inter se priority on maritime lien
(1)  Every  maritime  lien  shall  have  the  following
order of inter se priority, namely:— 
(a) claims for wages and other sums due to the
master, officers and other members of the vessel’s
complement in respect of their employment on the
vessel,  including  costs  of  repatriation  and  social
20insurance contributions payable on their behalf; 
(b) claims in respect of loss of life or personal injury
occurring, whether on land or on water, in direct
connection with the operation of the vessel; 
(c) claims for reward for salvage services including
special compensation relating thereto;
(d) claims for port, canal, and other waterway dues
and  pilotage  dues  and  any  other  statutory  dues
related to the vessel; 
(e)  claims  based  on  tort  arising  out  of  loss  or
damage caused by the operation of the vessel other
than loss or damage to cargo and containers carried
on the vessel. 
(2) The maritime lien specified in sub-section (1)
shall continue to exist on the vessel notwithstanding
any change of ownership or of registration or of flag
and shall be extinguished after expiry of a period of
one year unless, prior to the expiry of such period,
the vessel has been arrested or seized and such
arrest or seizure has led to a forced sale by the
High Court: 
Provided that for a claim under clause (a) of sub-
section (1), the period shall be two years from the
date on which the wage, sum, cost of repatriation or
social insurance contribution, falls due or becomes
payable. 
(3) The maritime lien referred to in this section shall
commence— 
(a) in relation to the maritime lien under clause (a)
of sub-section (1), upon the claimant’s  discharge
from the vessel; 
(b) in relation to the maritime liens under clauses (b)
to (e) of sub-section (1), when the claim arises, 
21and shall run continuously without any suspension
or interruption: 
Provided that the period during which the vessel
was under arrest or seizure shall be excluded. 
(4)  No  maritime  lien  shall  attach  to  a  vessel  to
secure a claim which arises out of or results from— 
(a) damage in connection with the carriage of oil or
other hazardous or noxious substances by sea for
which  compensation  is  payable  to  the  claimants
pursuant to any law for the time being in force; 
(b) the radioactive properties or a combination of
radioactive properties with toxic, explosive or other
hazardous  properties  of  nuclear  fuel  or  of
radioactive products or waste.”
15.Section 12 states that the Code of Civil Procedure is to
apply in all proceedings before the High Court insofar as it is
not inconsistent or contrary to the provisions of the Act. By
Section 17, the Admiralty Court Acts of 1840 and 1861 and the
Colonial  Courts  of  Admiralty  Acts  of  1890  and  1891  stand
repealed.  Also, the Letters Patent of 1865, insofar as it applies
to the admiralty jurisdiction of the Bombay, Calcutta and Madras
High Courts, also stands repealed. 
16.An  admiralty  action  in  the  courts  of  India  commences
against a vessel to enforce what is called a “maritime claim”.
Though India is not a signatory to the Brussels Convention of
221952, a long list of maritime claims is given in Article 1 thereof.
Suffice  it  to  say  that  sub-clause  (k)  of  Article  1  states  that
important  materials  wherever  supplied  to  a  ship  for  her
operation or maintenance would fall within the definition of a
maritime claim.  A maritime lien, on the other hand, attaches to
the property of the vessel whenever the cause of action arises,
and  travels  with  the  vessel  and  subsists  whenever  and
wherever  the  action  may  be  commenced.   In  The Bold
Buccleugh, (1852) 7 Moo PCC 267, Sir John Jervis defined
maritime lien as follows:-
“[A] maritime lien is well defined … to mean a claim
or  privilege  upon  a  thing  to  be  carried
into effect by legal process … that process to be a
proceeding in rem…. This claim or privilege travels
with the thing into whosesoever possession it may
come.  It is inchoate from the moment the claim or
privilege attaches, and, when carried into effect by
legal process by a proceeding in rem, relates back
to the period when it first attached.”
17.This  judgment  was  referred  to  in  M.V.  Elisabeth  and
others v.  Harwan Investment and Trading Private Limited ,
1993 Supp. (2) SCC 433 at 462, paragraph 56 and  Epoch
Enterrepots v.  M.V.  Won  Fu  (2003)  1  SCC  305  at  311,
paragraph  13.  In  M.V.  Al  Quamar  v.  Tsavliris  Salvage
23(International) Ltd. and others , (2000) 8 SCC 278 at 301, the
Supreme Court observed as follows:-
“33.Be  it noted  that there  are two  attributes  to
maritime lien: (a) a right to a part of the property in
the  res;  and  (b)  a  privileged  claim  upon  a  ship,
aircraft  or  other  maritime  property  in  respect  of
services  rendered  to,  or  injury  caused  by  that
property.  Maritime lien thus attaches to the property
in the event the cause of action arises and remains
attached.  It is, however, inchoate and very little
positive in value unless it is enforced by an action.
It is a right which springs from general maritime law
and is based on the concept as if the ship itself has
caused the harm, loss or damage to others or to
their property and thus must itself make good that
loss.  (See  in  this  context  Maritime  Law  by
Christopher Hill, 2nd Edn.).”
18.Only a small number of claims give rise to maritime liens
as was noted in  M.V. Won Fu (supra).  Paragraph 19 of the
said judgment states as follows:-
“19.We have in this judgment hereinbefore dealt
with  the  attributes  of  maritime  lien.  But  simply
stated,  maritime  lien  can  be  said  to  exist  or
restricted to in the event of (a) damage done by a
ship; (b) salvage; (c) seamen’s and master’s wages;
(d) master’s disbursement; and (e) bottomry; and in
the event a maritime lien exists in the aforesaid five
circumstances,  a  right  in  rem  is  said  to  exist.
Otherwise, a right in personam exists for any claim
that may arise out of a contract.”
(at pages 314-315) 
2419.In an illuminating judgment of the Calcutta High Court
Justice Mrs. Ruma Pal, as she then was, dealt with an action in
rem filed in the admiralty court jurisdiction in Calcutta. With
respect to the plaintiffs claim of the price of bunkers supplied to
the ship owners, the Court held that the supply of necessaries
to  a  vessel  does  not  create  a  maritime  lien.   In  Bailey
Petroleum Company  v. Owners and parties interested in the
vessel M.V. Dignity , (1993) 2 CHN 208 at 213-214, the learned
Judge held:
“16. It  has  been  established  by  a  wealth  of
decisions that the supply of necessaries does not
create  a  maritime  lien.  Indeed  the  point  was
conceded  by  the  counsel  for  the  plaintiff  at  the
hearing.  It  is  only  necessary  to  refer  to  two
authorities on the point to emphasize the fact that
this  Court  does  not  base  its  conclusion  on  the
concession  of  the  plaintiff’s  counsel  but  on  the
authorities cited.
17. It is not disputed that the jurisdiction of this court
is governed by the Admiralty Court Act 1861 (Imp).
Section 5 of the 1861 Act provides:
“5. The High Court of Admiralty shall have
jurisdiction over any claim for necessaries
supplied to any ship elsewhere than in the
port to which the ship belongs, unless it is
shown to the satisfaction of the court that
25at the time of the institution of the cause
any  owner  or  part  owner  of  the  ship  is
domiciled in England or Wales: Provided
always,  that  if  in  any  such  cause  the
plaintiff do not recover twenty pounds, he
shall not be entitled to any costs, charges,
or  expenses  incurred  by  him  therein,
unless  the  judge  shall  certify  that  the
cause was a fit one to be tried in the said
Court.”
18. In the case of Laws and others and Smith : the
“Rio  Tinto”:  9  PD  356,  the  plaintiff  had  supplied
necessaries to the vessel. The Trial Court held that
the necessaries were supplied on the credit of the
vessel and that the plaintiff had a right to a maritime
lien and that, therefore, in spite of the fact that the
vessel  had  been  transferred  subsequent  to  the
supply  of  necessaries,  the  ship  was  liable.  Sir
James  Hannen  who  delivered  the  opinion  of  the
Privy Council held that the phrase “the court shall
have jurisdiction” simply gave the Court jurisdiction
but did not create any lien. A distinction was drawn
between a provision for proceedings by arrest of the
ship and the express creation of a lien. The Court
held:
“The Admiralty Court Act, 1861 (24 Vict.
c. 10) and the decisions upon it must
next be considered. By the 5th section it
is  enacted  that  the  High  Court  shall
have  jurisdiction  over  a  claim  for
necessaries  supplied  to  any  ship
elsewhere than in the port to which the
ship belongs, unless it is shown to the
satisfaction of the court that, at the time
of the institution of the cause, any owner
or part owner of the ship is domiciled in
26England or Wales.
The words ‘the High Court of Admiralty
shall have jurisdiction’, mean only what
they  purport  to  say,  neither  more  nor
less,  that  is,  that  the  court  shall  take
judicial  cognizance  of  the  cases
provided for.
The conclusion [is] that there is nothing
from which it can be inferred that by the
use of the words “the court shall have
jurisdiction” the Legislature intended to
create  a  maritime  lien  with  respect  to
necessaries  supplied  within  the
possession.”
19. In Shell Oil Co. v. The Ship “Lastrigoni ” 3 ALR
399 the plaintiff had filed a suit for enforcement of
the claim on the ground of bunkers provided by the
plaintiff under a contract between the plaintiff and
the  agents  of  the  time  charterer.  The  contract
provided  that  the  sale  and  delivery  of  inter
alia necessaries would be made on the faith and
credit of the vessel. The arguments before the Court
were that the supply of fuel itself created maritime
lien to which the ship was subject and which could
be enforced by an action  in rem in admiralty. The
second was that, in the circumstances, an action  in
rem lay  notwithstanding  the  absence  of  any
contractual liability on the part of the owners to pay
for the bunkers supplied and that this was so by
virtue of section 6 of the Admiralty Court Act 1840
(Imp), and section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act 1861
(Imp), either with or without the aid of cl. 6.4 of the
Bunker Fuel Oil Contract. Menzies, J. held:
27“The matter was, I think, put at rest by
the decision of the Privy Council in the
Rio  Tinto  (1884)  9  APP  Cas  356,  by
which it was decided that no maritime
lien  attaches  to  a  ship  in  respect  of
coals or other necessaries supplied to
it.”
20.In Saba International Shipping  and Project Investment
Private  Limited  v.  Owners  and  parties  interested  in  the
Vessel M.V. Brave Eagle, previously known as M.V. Lima-I
and  others,  (2002)  2  CHN  280  at  287-288  and  289-290,
another  single  Judge  of  the  same  High  Court  differentiated
between a maritime claim and a maritime lien and held as
follows:
“20. Now the issue is what is a maritime claim and
what is a maritime lien. These questions are to be
answered in this proceeding before continuation of
the  interim  order  or  passing  any  further  interim
order.
21. All cases of maritime lien are based on maritime
claims but all maritime claims do not give rise to a
maritime lien on the ship. Normally a lien in the
general law is a rather limited right over some one
else’s property. It is a right to retain possession of
that  property  usually  to  receive  a  claim.  But  a
maritime lien differs from other liens in one very
important  respect.  Liens  generally  require
possession of the ‘ res’ before they can come into
effect. As an example an innkeeper has a lien over
28his guest’s luggage against the payment of the bill,
but  if  the  guest  is  smart  enough  to  remove  his
luggage, the innkeeper is left without a lien. But a
maritime lien does not require prior possession for
its creation. In a fit and proper case a claimant on
the  strength  of  his  maritime  lien  can  secure  the
arrest  of  a  ship  which  then  comes  under  the
possession of the court and she cannot be moved
without the court’s order.
22. ‘No Indian Statute defines a maritime claim’ is
the  clear  finding  of  Supreme  Court  in  M.V.
Elisabeth (AIR 1993 SC 1014, para 85, page 1040).
But our Supreme Court followed the provisions of
the  Supreme  Court  Act  1981  of  England  where
maritime claims have been listed on the basis of
Brussels Convention of 1952 on the Arrest of Sea
Going Ships. Under Article 1 of the said Convention
various maritime claims have been catalogued. Out
of which 1(k) answers the description of the claims
of the plaintiff in this proceeding. Article 1(k) reads
“goods or materials whether supplied to a ship for
her operation or maintenance”. Even though India is
not a signatory to the Brussels Convention, but the
Supreme Court held  that the  provisions  of these
Conventions  should  be  regarded  as  part  of
International  Common  Law  and  these  provisions
‘supplement’ and ‘complement’ our maritime laws
and fill up the lacunae in The Merchant Shipping
Act.
23. But in Elisabeth, the Hon’ble Supreme Court did
not  notice  any  convention  on  maritime  lien.
However the Hon’ble Supreme Court accepted in
para 57 of Elisabeth the judicial determination of the
concept  of  ‘maritime  lien’ by  English  courts  and
which I quote as follows:
29“A maritime  lien  is  a  privileged  claim
against the ship or a right to a part of the
property in the ship, and it “travels” with
the ship. Because the ship has to “pay
for  the  wrong  it  has  done”,  it  can  be
compelled to do so  by  a forced  sale.
(See The Bold Buccleugh, (1852) 7 Moo
PCC 267).”
24. A definition of maritime lien has also been given
in  Stroud’s  Judicial  Dictionary,  5th  Edition  page
1466 to the following effect:
“A maritime lien may be defined as a
right  specifically  binding  a  ship,  her
furniture, tackle, cargo, and freight, or
any  of  them,  for  payment  of  a  claim
founded  upon  the  maritime  law  and
entitling  the  claimant  to  take  judicial
proceedings against the property bound
to enforce, or to ascertain and enforce,
satisfaction  of  his  demand;  thus,  a
salvor  has  a  maritime  lien  on  the
property saved for such an amount as a
court  exercising  admiralty  jurisdiction
shall  award.  Maritime  lien  are
distinguished  from  all  other  liens  in
these two chief particulars: (i) they are in
no  way  founded  on  possession  or
property  in  the  claimant,  (ii)  they  are
exercised by taking proceedings against
the  property  itself  in  a  form  of  action
styled  an  action  in  rem  (The  Glasgow
Packet, 2 Rob. W. 312; The Repulse, 4
Notes of Cas. 170), and, from this and
their  secret  nature,  they  closely
resemble the species of security known
to  Roman  law  under  the  name  of
30hypotheca  (Dig.  xiii).  Interest,  if  any
allowed,  and  the  costs  of  enforcing  a
claim for which a maritime lien exists,
will  be  included  in  such  lien  (The
Margaret, 3 Hagg. Adm. 240).”
25. According to the well known treatise of Thomas
on maritime lien, the following claims may give rise
to maritime lien namely:
“(a) Damage done by a ship
(b) Salvage
(c) Seamen’s wages
(d) Master’s wages and disbursements
(e) Bottomry and respondentia”.
26. The aforesaid passage from Thomas has been
approved by the Division Bench of Calcutta High
Court  in Mohammed  Saleh  Behbehani  &
Company v. Bhoja  Trader,  reported  in  (1983)  2
Calcutta Law Journal 334. At 344 of the report, the
learned Judges of the Division Bench referred to
maritime liens as representing ‘a small cluster of
claims’ and referred to the aforementioned passage
from Thomas.
(27) and (28) xxx xxx xxx
29. Counsel  for  the  respondent  also  relies  on  a
passage from Roscoe on The Admiralty Jurisdiction
and  Practice,  5th Edition.  While  dealing  with
necessaries,  the  learned  author  has  stated  as
follows:
“Persons  who  have  supplied  a  ship,
whether  British  or  foreign,  with
necessaries  have  not  a  maritime  lien
upon  her,  and  the  vessel  does  not
become chargeable with the debt till the
31suit is actually instituted; consequently
there can be no  claim  against a  ship
which has been sold, even with notice of
such  a  claim  in  respect  of  which  an
action has not been commenced, and a
want  of  caution  in  supplying  the
necessaries may, it would seem, cause
a  postponement  of  claims  to  others
more carefully begun. The necessaries
claimant is not a secured creditor until
the moment of arrest.”
30. There is a direct judgment on this point by a
learned  Judge  of  this  court  in  Bailey  Petroleum ,
referred to above.
31. Relying on the judgment of the Privy Council
in Rio Tinto, reported in 1884 (9) Appeal Cases 356
and  the  judgment  in  Shell  Oil  Co.  v. The  Ship
Lastrigoni, reported in 1974 (3) All England Reports
399,  the  learned  single  Judge  held  in  Bailey
Petroleum that a claim arising out of the supply of
necessaries may give rise  to a statutory  right  of
action ‘in rem’ under section 5 of Admiralty Court
Act, 1861 but it does not give rise to maritime lien.
Paragraphs 23 and 24 of the judgment in Bailey
Petroleum  make  it  clear  and  I  quote  them  in
extenso:
“23. Whereas a maritime lien attaches to
the res and travels with it and may be
enforced  against  a  subsequent
purchaser of the  res, a statutory right of
action in rem is defeated by a change of
ownership.  This  later  principle  follows
from the nature of the right described in
32the preceding paragraph.
24. This view of the law is supported by
a catena of decisions.”
21.In fact, the International Convention on Maritime Lien and
Mortgages, 1993 defines maritime liens in Article 4 as follows:-
“Article 4: Maritime liens  
I. Each of the following claims against the owner,
demise charterer, manager or operator of the vessel
shall be secured by a maritime lien on the vessel: 
(a) claims for wages and other sums due to the
master, officers and other members of the vessel’s
complement in respect of their employment on the
vessel,  including  costs  of  repatriation  and  social
insurance contributions payable on their behalf;
(b) claims in respect of loss of life or personal injury
occurring, whether on land or on water, in direct
connection with the operation of the vessel; 
(c) claims for reward for the salvage of the vessel; 
(d) claims for port, canal, and other waterway dues
and pilotage dues; 
(e) claims based on tort arising out of physical loss
or damage caused by the operation of the vessel
other than loss of or damage to cargo, containers
and passengers’ effects carried on the vessel.
2. No maritime lien shall attach to a vessel to secure
claims as set out in subparagraphs (b) and (e) of
33paragraph 1 which arise out of or result from: 
(a) damage in connection with the carriage of oil or
other hazardous or noxious substances by sea for
which  compensation  is  payable  to  the  claimants
pursuant to international conventions or national law
providing for strict liability and compulsory insurance
or other means of securing the claims; or 
(b) the radioactive properties or a combination of
radioactive properties with toxic, explosive or other
hazardous  properties  of  nuclear  fuel  or  of
radioactive products or waste.”
22.Article 8 then states that the characteristics of such liens
are as follows:-
“Article 8: Characteristics of maritime liens 
Subject to the provisions of article 12, the maritime
liens follow the vessel, notwithstanding any change
of ownership or of registration or of flag.”
       It is, thus, clear that a claim for necessaries supplied to a
vessel does not become a maritime lien which attaches to the
vessel.
23.Shri Divan, however, cited U.S. case law in support of his
submission that a claim for necessaries raises a maritime lien.
We are afraid that given the Indian case law on the subject read
with the various international Conventions referred to above,
34the U.S. seems to stand alone in considering that claims for
necessaries would amount to maritime lien enforceable against
the vessel as such wherever it goes.  It is clear that in our
country at least claims for necessaries, though maritime claims,
do not raise a maritime lien. 
24.What arises next, therefore, is the manner of enforcement
of maritime claims in our Courts. In M.V. Elisabeth  (supra) at
459-462, this Court laid down, in some detail, the basic features
of the admiralty jurisdiction in this country, and how maritime
claims are to be enforced. The Court held:
“Admiralty Law confers upon the claimant a right  in
rem to  proceed  against  the  ship  or  cargo  as
distinguished from a right  in personam to proceed
against the owner. The arrest of the ship is regarded
as a mere procedure to obtained security to satisfy
judgment.  A  successful  plaintiff  in  an  action  in
rem has  a  right  to  recover  damages  against  the
property  of  the  defendant.  “The  liability  of  the
shipowner  is  not  limited  to  the  value  of
the res primarily proceeded against …. An action …
though  originally  commenced  in  rem,  becomes  a
personal  action  against  a  defendant  upon
appearance,  and  he  becomes  liable  for  the  full
amount  of  a  judgment  unless  protected  by  the
statutory  provisions  for  the  limitation  of  liability”.’
(Roscoe’s Admiralty Practice , 5th ed. p. 29)
35The  foundation  of  an  action  in  rem,  which  is  a
peculiarity of the Anglo-American law, arises from a
maritime lien or claim imposing a personal liability
upon the owner of the vessel. A defendant in an
admiralty  action  in  personam is  liable  for  the  full
amount of the plaintiff’s established claim. Likewise,
a defendant acknowledging service in an action  in
rem is liable to be saddled with full  liability  even
when  the  amount  of  the  judgment  exceeds  the
value of the res or of the bail provided. An action  in
rem lies  in  the  English  High  Court  in  respect  of
matters regulated by the Supreme Court Act 1981,
and in relation to a number of claims the jurisdiction
can be invoked not only against the offending ship
in question but also against a ‘sistership’ i.e., a ship
in  the  same  beneficial  ownership  as  the  ship  in
regard to which the claim arose. 
“The  vessel  which  commits  the
aggression is treated as the offender, as
the guilty instrument or thing to which
the  forfeiture  attaches,  without  any
reference  whatsoever  to  the  character
or conduct of the owner ….” (Per Justice
Story, The  United  States  v. The  Big
Malek Adhel [43 US (2 How) 210, 233
(1844)]).”
xxx xxx xxx
A ship may be arrested ( i) to acquire jurisdiction; or
(ii) to obtain security for satisfaction of the claim
when decreed; or ( iii) in execution of a decree. In
the first two cases, the court has the discretion to
insist upon security being furnished by the plaintiff
to compensate the defendant in the event of it being
found that the arrest was wrongful and was sought
and  obtained  maliciously  or  in  bad  faith.  The
claimant is liable in damages for wrongful arrest.
36This  practice  of  insisting  upon  security  being
furnished by the party seeking arrest of the ship is
followed  in  the  United  States,  Japan  and  other
countries. The reason for the rule is that a wrongful
arrest can cause irreparable loss and damages to
the  shipowner;  and  he  should  in  that  event  be
compensated by the arresting party. (See  Arrest of
Ships by Hill, Soehring, Hosoi and Helmer, 1985).
The attachment by arrest is only provisional and its
purpose is merely to detain the ship until the matter
has been finally settled by a competent court. The
attachment of the vessel brings it under the custody
of the Marshal or any other authorized officer. Any
interference  with  his  custody  is  treated  as  a
contempt of the court which has ordered the arrest.
But the Marshal’s right under the attachment order
is  not  one  of  possession,  but  only  of  custody.
Although the custody of the vessel has passed from
the defendant to the Marshal, all the possessory
rights  which  previously  existed  continue  to  exist,
including  all  the  remedies  which  are  based  on
possession.  The  warrant  usually  contains  a
monition to all persons interested to appear before
the court on a particular day and show cause why
the property should not be condemned and sold to
satisfy the claim of the plaintiff.
The  attachment  being  only  a  method  of
safeguarding the interest of the plaintiff by providing
him with a security, it is not likely to be ordered if the
defendant or his lawyer agrees to “accept service
and to put in bail or to pay money into court in lieu
of bail”. (See Halsbury’s Laws of England , 4th edn.,
Vol. 1, p. 375 etc.).
xxx xxx xxx
37A  personal  action  may  be  brought  against  the
defendant if he is either present in the country or
submits to jurisdiction. If the foreign owner of an
arrested ship appears before the court and deposits
security as bail for the release of his ship against
which proceedings  in rem have been instituted, he
submits himself to jurisdiction.
An action in rem is directed against the ship itself to
satisfy the claim of the plaintiff out of the  res. The
ship is for this purpose treated as a person. Such an
action may constitute an inducement to the owner to
submit  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court,  thereby
making himself liable to be proceeded against by
the plaintiff in personam. It is, however, imperative
in an action in rem that the ship should be within
jurisdiction at the time the proceedings are started.
A decree of the court in such an action binds not
merely the parties to the writ but everybody in the
world who might dispute the plaintiff’s claim.
It is by means of an action  in rem that the arrest of a
particular ship is secured by the plaintiff. He does
not sue the owner directly and by name; but the
owner or any one interested in the proceedings may
appear and defend. The writ is issued to “owners
and  parties  interested  in  the  property  proceeded
against”.  The  proceedings  can  be  started  in
England  or  in  the  United  States  in  respect  of  a
maritime  lien,  and  in  England  in  respect  of  a
statutory right in rem. A maritime lien is a privileged
claim against the ship or a right to a part of the
property in the ship, and it “travels” with the ship.
Because the ship has to “pay for the wrong it has
done”, it can be compelled to do so by a forced
sale.  [See Bold  Buccleaugh  (The)  [Harmer v. Bell,
(1851) 7 Moo PC 267 : 13 ER 884]]. In addition to
maritime  liens,  a  ship  is  liable  to  be  arrested  in
England  in  enforcement  of  statutory  rights  in
38rem (Supreme Court Act 1981). If the owner does
not submit to the jurisdiction and appear before the
court to put in bail and release the ship, it is liable to
be  condemned  and  sold  to  satisfy  the  claims
against  her.  If,  however,  the  owner  submits  to
jurisdiction and obtains the release of the ship by
depositing security, he becomes personally liable to
be proceeded against  in personam in execution of
the judgment if the amount decreed exceeds the
amount of the bail. The arrest of the foreign ship by
means  of  an  action  in  rem is  thus  a  means  of
assuming jurisdiction by the competent court.”
25.The Court went on to hold that though Indian statutes lag
behind international law in this context, the principles in these
Conventions derived from the common law of nations, will be
treated as a part of the common law of India.  Paragraph 76 in
this behalf reads as under:-
“76. It  is  true  that  Indian  statutes  lag  behind  the
development of international law in comparison to
contemporaneous  statutes  in  England  and  other
maritime countries. Although the Hague Rules are
embodied  in  the Carriage  of  Goods  by  Sea  Act,
1925,  India  never  became  a  party  to  the
International  Convention  laying  down  those  rules
(International  Convention  for  the  Unification  of
Certain  Rules  of  Law  relating  to  Bills  of  Lading,
Brussels, 1924). The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,
1925  merely  followed  the  (United  Kingdom)
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924. The United
Kingdom repealed the Carriage of Goods by Sea
Act, 1924 with a view of incorporating the Visby
Rules adopted by the Brussels Protocol of 1968.
39The Hague-Visby Rules were accordingly adopted
by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 (United
Kingdom).  Indian  legislation  has  not,  however,
progressed, notwithstanding the Brussels Protocol
of  1968  adopting  the  Visby  Rules  or  the  United
Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by
Sea,  1978  adopting  the  Hamburg  Rules.  The
Hamburg Rules prescribe the minimum liabilities of
the carrier far more justly and equitably than the
Hague Rules so as to correct the tilt in the latter in
favour  of  the  carriers.  The  Hamburg  Rules  are
acclaimed to be a great improvement on the Hague
Rules and far more beneficial from the point of view
of the cargo owners. India has also not adopted the
International  Convention  relating  to  the  Arrest  of
Seagoing  Ships,  Brussels,  1952.  Nor  has  India
adopted the Brussels Conventions of 1952 on civil
and penal jurisdiction in matters of collision; nor the
Brussels Conventions of 1926 and 1967 relating to
maritime  liens  and  mortgages  [(a)  International
Convention relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships,
Brussels,  May  10,  1952  (IMC);  (b)  International
Convention  on  Certain  Rules  concerning  Civil
Jurisdiction in Matters of Collision, Brussels, May
10, 1952 (IMC); (c) International Convention for the
Unification  of  Certain  Rules  relating  to  Penal
Jurisdiction in Matters of Collision, Brussels, May
10, 1952 (IMC); and (d) International Conventions
for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to
Maritime Liens and Mortgages, Brussels, April 10,
1926,  and  the  Revised  Convention  on  Maritime
Lines  and  Mortgages,  Brussels,  May  29,  1967
(IMC).]  India  seems  to  be  lagging  behind  many
other  countries  in  ratifying  and  adopting  the
beneficial  provisions  of  various  conventions
intended  to  facilitate  international  trade.  Although
these  conventions  have  not  been  adopted  by
legislation,  the  principles  incorporated  in  the
conventions  are  themselves  derived  from  the
40common  law  of  nations  as  embodying  the  felt
necessities of international trade and are as such
part of the common law of India and applicable for
the enforcement of maritime claims against foreign
ships.”
(at pages 469-470)
A list of maritime claims was then referred to in paragraph
84 and the Brussels Convention relating to the Arrest of Sea-
Going Ships, 1992 was referred to and followed.
 
26.The next important aspect that was argued was that the
ownership of the vessel to enforce a maritime claim has to be
seen at the stage of institution of the suit and not at the stage
of arrest.  The general rule that is contained in our country as to
what  crystallises  on  the  date  of  a  suit  is  reflected  in
Rameshwar and others v. Jot Ram and others , 1976 1 SCR
847 at 851-52.  This Court held:-
“In P.  Venkateswarlu  v. Motor  &  General
Traders [(1975)  1 SCC  770,  772  :  AIR  1975  SC
1409,  1410]  this  Court  dealt  with  the  adjectival
activism  relating  to  post-institution  circumstances.
Two propositions were laid down. Firstly, it was held
that  [SCC  p.  772,  para  4]  ‘it  is  basic  to  our
processual jurisprudence that the right to relief must
be judged to exist as on the date a suitor institutes
the legal proceeding.’ This is an emphatic statement
that the right of a party is determined by the facts as
they  exist on  the  date  the  action  is  instituted .
41Granting  the  presence  of  such  facts,  then  he  is
entitled  to  its  enforcement.  Later  developments
cannot  defeat  his  right  because,  as  explained
earlier, had the court found his facts to be true the
day he sued he would have got his decree. The
Court’s  procedural  delays  cannot  deprive  him  of
legal justice or rights crystallised in the initial cause
of  action.  This  position  finds  support  in  Bhajan
Lal v. State of Punjab  [(1971) 1 SCC 34].
The impact of subsequent happenings may now be
spelt  out.  First,  its  bearing  on  the  right of  action,
second, on the nature of the  relief and third, on its
impotence to create or destroy substantive rights.
Where the nature of the relief, as originally sought,
has become obsolete or unserviceable or a new
form of relief will be more efficacious on account of
developments subsequent to the suit or even during
the appellate stage, it is but fair that the relief is
moulded, varied or reshaped in the light of updated
facts. Patterson [Patterson v. State  of  Alabama ,
(1934) 294 US 600, 607] illustrates this position. It is
important that the party claiming the relief or change
of relief must have  the same right  from which either
the  first  or  the  modified  remedy  may  flow.
Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot
be constitutive of  substantive rights  enforceable in
that very litigation except in a narrow category (later
spelt  out)  but  may  influence  the  equitable
jurisdiction  to  mould  reliefs.  Conversely,  where
rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be
nullified  or  negated  by  subsequent  events  save
where there is a change in the law and it is made
applicable  at  any  stage.  Lachmeshwar  Prasad
Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri  [1940 FCR 84 :
AIR  1941  FC  5]  falls  in  this  category.  Courts  of
justice may, when the compelling equities of a case
oblige them, shape  reliefs — cannot deny rights —
to  make  them  justly  relevant  in  the  updated
42circumstances.  Where  the  relief  is  discretionary,
courts  may  exercise  this  jurisdiction  to  avoid
injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy
depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or
absence of certain basic facts  at the time the relief
is  to  be  ultimately  granted ,  the  Court,  even  in
appeal, can take  note  of  such supervening  facts
with fundamental impact.  Venkateswarlu , read in its
statutory setting, falls in this category.” 
27.However, the International Convention on the Arrest of
Ships, 1999, in which India participated, states as follows:-
“Article 3: Exercise of right of arrest
1. Arrest is permissible of any ship in respect of
which a maritime claim is asserted if:
(a) the person who owned the ship at the time when
the maritime claim arose is liable for the claim and
is owner of the ship when the arrest is effected; or
(b) – (e) xxx xxx xxx
(2) xxx xxx xxx
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1
and 2 of this article, the arrest of a ship which is not
owned by the person liable for the claim shall be
permissible only if, under the law of the State where
the arrest is applied for, a judgment in respect of
that  claim  can  be  enforced  against  that  ship  by
judicial or forced sale of that ship.”
28.India is not a signatory to the aforesaid Convention, yet
following M.V. Elisabeth  (supra), this Convention becomes part
43of   our   national   law   and   must,   therefore,   be   followed
by this Court.    Article 3(1)(a) is in two parts. First, arrest is only
permissible  of  any  ship  if  a  maritime  claim  is
asserted against the person who owned the ship at a time when
the maritime claim arose for which the owner is liable, and
second, that the same ship owner should be the owner of the
ship when the arrest is effected. Thus, article 3(1)(a) sets the
controversy at rest because a maritime claim can be asserted
only at the time the arrest is effected and not at the time of the
institution of the suit. This being so, Shri Divan’s reliance on
English judgments to the contrary, namely Monica S. (1967) 2
Lloyd’s Rep. 113 as followed in Re, Aro Co Limited  1980 1 All
ER 1067, cannot be followed.  Both judgments were prior to the
1999  Convention  and  it  is  this  Convention  that  must  be
followed.  It is, therefore, clear that the relevant date on which
ownership of the vessel is to be determined is the date of arrest
and not the date of institution of the suit.  
29.At  this  stage  it  becomes  important  to  refer  to  the
agreement dated 18.1.2000 entered into between the petitioner
44and the original owner of the vessel, Third Element Enterprises.
The agreement has been set out fully earlier in this judgment.  A
perusal  of  the  agreement  would  show  that  so  far  as  the
appellant is concerned, performance is over — namely that a
certain quantity of bunkers has in accordance with the original
agreement been supplied.  Indeed this is expressly recited in
the later agreement.  It is only performance under the original
agreement that is lacking from the side of the owner of the
vessel, namely Third Element Enterprises.  The very first clause
of the agreement shows that the ship owners confirm that they
owe to the appellant the original amount of the bunkers plus
interest plus legal costs, which amounts are parasitic on the
original  invoice  amount  of  US$  94,611.25,  and  need  to  be
recovered in order to put the appellant in the same position as if
the  original  contract  had  been  performed  by  Third  Element
Enterprises. The agreement then goes on to state that since the
vessel is being chartered for a voyage from Bangkok and will
earn freight, the part of the freight amounting to the original
invoice amount plus interest plus legal costs will be paid directly
by the charterers  of  the  vessel  to the bank  account  of  the
45appellants.
30.Sections 62 and 63 of the Contract Act read as follows:-
“62. Effect of novation, rescission, and alteration
of contract.—If the parties to a contract agree to
substitute a new contract for it, or to rescind or alter
it, the original contract need not be performed. 
63.  Promisee  may  dispense  with  or  remit
performance of promise. — Every promisee may
dispense  with  or  remit,  wholly  or  in  part,  the
performance of the promise made to him, or may
extend  the  time  for  such  performance,  or  may
accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks
fit.” 
31.It is the appellant’s case that Section 63 of the Contract
Act is attracted to the facts of the present case whereas it is the
respondent’s case that Section 62 is so attracted, the result
being  that  the  original  agreement  is  substituted  by  a  fresh
agreement. 
32.The respondent’s case is that Section 62 applies, since
the original contract has been “altered”.  This being the case,
the original contract need not be performed. 
33.It  is  clear  that  where  parties  to  a  contract  agree  to
substitute  a  completely  different  contract  for  the  first,  or  to
46rescind a contract, the performance under the original contract
and/or rescinded contract comes to an end.  When parties to a
contract “alter” a contract, the question that has to be answered
is  as  to  whether  the  original  contract  is  altered  in  such  a
manner that performance under it is at an end.  
34.In Juggilal Kamlapat  v. N.V. Internationale Crediet-En-
Handels Vereeninging ‘Rotter-dam’ , AIR 1955 Cal 65, the
original  contract  dated  10.8.1950  contained  an  arbitration
clause.  In paragraph 11 of the judgment, it was found as a fact
that  the  original  contract  was  modified  in  certain  material
particulars.  Despite  this,  it  was  found  that  since  the
modifications do not go to the root of the original contract and
do not change its essential character, the facts do not warrant
the inference that the parties intended to rescind the original
contract.  The High Court held:-
“14. In the present case the modifications do not go
to  the  very  root  of  the  first  contract  and  do  not
change  its  essential  character.  The  facts  do  not
warrant the inference that the parties intended to
rescind  the  contract,  dated  10-8-1950.  The  April
arrangement  was  entered  into  in  response  to
pressing demands for delivery under that contract
and with a view to implement it. The arrangement
47has no independent contractual force, no meaning
and content separately from and independently of
the original contract.
15. The effect of the alterations or modifications is
that there is a new arrangement; in the language of
Viscount Haldane in 1918 A. C. 1 at p. 17 (A), 
“a new contract containing as an entirety the
old terms together with and as modified by the
new terms incorporated.”
The modifications are read into and become part
and  parcel  of  the  original  contract.  The  original
terms also continue to be part of the contract and
are not rescinded and/or superseded except in so
far as they are inconsistent with the modifications.
Those  of  the  original  terms  which  cannot  make
sense  when  read  with  the  alterations  must  be
rejected. In my view the arbitration clause in this
case is in no way inconsistent with the subsequent
modifications and continues to subsist.”
(at page 67)
35.We approve of the said judgment as laying down the
correct  law  on  the  expression  “alter”  in  Section  62  of  the
Contract Act.  In order that a contract that is altered in material
particulars  fall  under  Section  62,  it  must  be  clear  that  the
alteration must go to the very root of the original contract and
change its essential character, so that the modified contract
must be read as doing away with the original contract.  If the
48modified contract has no independent contractual force, in that
it  has  no  meaning  and  content  separately  from  and
independently of the original contract, it is clear that there is no
new  contract  which  comes  into  being.   The  original  terms
continue to be part of the modified contract except to the extent
that they are inconsistent with the modifications made.
36.On the other hand, Section 63 of the Contract Act would
clearly apply to the facts of the present case. Illustration “c” to
Section 63 is apposite, and reads as follows:-
“(c)A owes B 5,000 rupees.  C pays to B 1,000
rupees  and  B  accepts  them,  in  satisfaction  of  his
claim on A.  This payment is a discharge of the whole
claim.” 
37.The aforesaid illustration makes it clear that a promisee
may  accept  satisfaction  from  a  third  party  which  then
discharges the promisor from further performance of the original
contract. 
38.In  Kapur Chand Godha  v.  Mir Nawab Himayatalikhan
Azamjah, (1963) 2 SCR 168, one Baboo Mull and Company
sold and delivered to the Prince of Berar various articles of
jewellery. The jewellery was, in fact, delivered by the appellants
49to the Prince.  Several  payments  were  made by a  Princes
Debts Settlement Committee.  Ultimately, a payment for a sum
of  Rs.27,79,078/-  was  made  which  was  received  by  the
appellant stating that payment had been made in full.  
39.Since  a  balance  of  Rs.9,99,940/-  still  remained,  the
appellants filed a suit against the respondent-Prince.  The suit
was  allowed  by  the  trial  court  but  dismissed  by  the  first
Appellate Court which came to a contrary conclusion.  The
Supreme Court agreed with the Appellate Court in dismissing
the suit.  It was, therefore, held: 
“There  was  some  difference  of  evidence  as  to
whether Ex. C bore the signature of Kapurchand
when  it  was  first  presented  to  Madhava  Rao  or
whether the signature was later put on it. With that
difference we are not now concerned. Nor are we
concerned  with  certain  minor  discrepancies
between the evidence of the two witnesses referred
to above. The substantial result of the evidence of
the two witnesses to whom we have referred is that
whatever reluctance Kapurchand might have had in
accepting Rs. 20 lacs in full satisfaction of the claim
of the appellants, he ultimately agreed to do so. Not
only  did  he  agree,  but  he  actually  endorsed  full
satisfaction  and  payment  on  all  the  promissory
notes and thereafter he received payment of the
second instalment of Rs. 8,75,000/ which along with
the first instalment of Rs.11,25,000/- made up the
sum  of  Rs.  20  lacs.  On  these  facts  which  are
50established by the evidence given on behalf of the
appellants themselves, the only conclusion is that
there  was  full  satisfaction  of  the  claim  of  the
appellants.
The legal position is clear enough. Section 63 of the
Indian Contract Act reads:
“Every promisee may dispense with or
remit, wholly or in part, the performance
of  the  promise  made  to  him,  or  may
extend the time for such performance or
may accept instead of it any satisfaction
which he thinks fit.”
Illustration (c) to the section says 
“A owes B 5000 rupees. C pays to B
1000  rupees,  and  B  accepts  them  in
satisfaction  of  his  claim  on  A.  This
payment  is  a  discharge  of  the  whole
claim.” 
It seems to us that this case is completely covered
by s. 63 and illustration (c) thereof. The appellants
having accepted payment in full satisfaction of their
claim, are not now entitled to sue the respondent for
the balance.” 
(at pages 178-179)
This Court further went on to hold that the niceties of English
Law in the matter of accord and satisfaction do not concern
Indian Courts in view of Section 63 of the Act. 
5140.It is clear that on the facts in the present case as the
original contract has been performed only by one party to the
contract and not by the other, the second agreement is entered
into so that the promisee (i.e. the appellant herein) may accept,
instead  of  the  original  performance  of  the  agreement,  any
satisfaction which it thinks fit. Thus, the agreement deals with
one leg of the original transaction, the leg of payment which has
not yet been made while keeping the original transaction alive.
The other clauses of the agreement buttress this conclusion.
Under clause 4, the ship owner will not sell the vessel prior to
the satisfaction of the aforesaid claim.  And, above all, under
clause (6), if for any reason the said payment is not made, the
appellant will be entitled to take all appropriate legal  steps,
which include arrest of the vessel, for recovery of the said
amount. Even  by clause (8), the original agreement is kept
alive.   In  the  event  that  the  ship  is  unable  to  proceed  to
Bangkok, the appellant maintains its rights of recovery against
the shipowner and the vessel. If the original agreement had
disappeared  by  novatio,  there  is  no  question  of  taking
appropriate steps to arrest the vessel which is owned by the
52ship owner who is the promisee and who has not yet performed
his  part  of  the  contract.  A  guarantee  clause  contained  in
clauses 7 and 8 is again only an additional string to the bow of
payment.  The fact that exclusive jurisdiction is given to the
courts at Piraeus, Greece has to be read with clause 6 of the
agreement.  Obviously, arrest of the vessel for recovering the
aforesaid amount in case payment is not made can be at any
port, and not merely at Piraeus.  For all these reasons, we are
of the view that the aforesaid agreement read as a whole does
not amount to a novatio of the original agreement, but was in
fact entered into keeping the original agreement alive in order
to ensure that payment under the original agreement is made to
the appellants. In fact, the agreement dated 18.1.2000 is not a
settlement of the original claim at a lesser amount.  As has
been held by us, it is only a means of enforcing the payment leg
of  the  original  transaction  through  a  third  party  charterer.
Consequent upon the vessel not sailing to Bangkok or the third
party charterer failing to make payment, the original obligation
of the appellant continued, and was enforceable by the arrest of
the vessel.  It is settled law that an agreement such as the
53agreement dated 18.1.2000 is not to be construed legalistically
but is to be construed as ordinary businessmen would construe
it.  In words which have become classic, Lord Wright in Hillas v.
Arcos, [1932] All ER 494 at 503-504 , has stated:-
“Business  men  often  record  the  most  important
agreements in crude and summary fashion; modes
of expression sufficient  and clear to them  in the
course  of  their  business  may  appear  to  those
unfamiliar with the business far from complete or
precise. It is, accordingly, the duty of the court to
construe such documents fairly and broadly, without
being too astute or subtle in finding defects; but, on
the contrary, the court should seek to apply the old
maxim of English law,  verba ita sunt intelligenda ut
res  magis  valeat  quam  pereat .  That  maxim,
however, does not mean that the court is to make a
contract for the parties, or to go outside the words
they  have  used,  except  insofar  as  there  are
appropriate implications of law, as, for instance, the
implication  of  what  is  just  and  reasonable  to  be
ascertained  by  the  court  as  matter  of  machinery
where  the  contractual  intention  is  clear  but  the
contract is silent on some detail. Thus in contracts
for future performance over a period, the parties
may not be able nor may they desire to specify
many  matters  of  detail,  but  leave  them  to  be
adjusted in the working out of the contract.”
41.Equally  in  Satya  Jain and  others v.  Anis  Ahmed
Rushdie and others  (2013) 8 SCC 131 at 143, this Court has
held:-
54“The  principle  of  business  efficacy  is  normally
invoked to read a term in an agreement or contract
so  as  to  achieve  the  result  or  the  consequence
intended  by  the  parties  acting  as  prudent
businessmen. Business efficacy means the power
to  produce  intended  results.  The  classic  test  of
business  efficacy  was  proposed  by  Bowen,  L.J.
in Moorcock  [(1889) LR 14 PD 64 (CA)]. This test
requires  that  a  term  can  only  be  implied  if  it  is
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract
to  avoid  such  a  failure  of  consideration  that  the
parties  cannot  as  reasonable  businessmen  have
intended. But only the most limited term should then
be implied—the bare minimum to achieve this goal.
If the contract makes business sense without the
term,  the  courts  will  not  imply  the  same.  The
following passage from the opinion of Bowen, L.J.
in Moorcock [(1889) LR 14 PD 64 (CA)] sums up
the position: (PD p. 68)
“…  In  business  transactions  such  as
this, what the law desires to effect by the
implication  is  to  give  such  business
efficacy to the transaction as must have
been  intended  at  all  events  by  both
parties  who  are  businessmen;  not  to
impose on one side all the perils of the
transaction, or to emancipate one side
from all the chances of failure, but to
make  each  party  promise  in  law  as
much,  at  all  events,  as  it  must  have
been  in  the  contemplation  of  both
parties that he should be responsible for
in respect of those perils or chances.”
5542.Reading  the  agreement  through  the  prism  of  a
businessman’s eye, it is clear that all that the agreement does
is  to  reinforce  the  original  agreement  by  seeing  that  the
payment under the said agreement is made.  We, therefore,
disagree with the view taken by the Division Bench that there is
a novatio of the original agreement in the fact circumstance of
the present case. 
43.However, Mr. Banerjee cited a passage from Halsbury’s
Laws of England and strongly relied upon a Singapore High
Court  judgment  to  argue  otherwise.   The  passage  from
Halsbury (Vol. 37, 4th ed., p. 287) reads as follows:-
“391. Effect of settlement or compromise.  Where
the  parties  settle  or  compromise  pending
proceedings, whether before, at or during the trial,
the settlement or compromise constitutes a new and
independent  agreement  between  them  made  for
good consideration.  Its effects are (1) to put an end
to the proceedings, for they are thereby spent and
exhausted; (2) to preclude the parties from taking
any further steps in the action, except where they
have  provided  for  liberty  to  apply  to  enforce  the
agreed  terms;  and  (3)  to  supersede  the  original
cause  of  action  altogether.  A judgment  or  order
made by consent is binding unless and until it has
been  set  aside  in  proceedings  instituted  for  that
purpose and it acts, moreover, as an estoppel by
record.”
5644.It is important to remember that when Section 63 of the
Contract Act is to be applied, the High Courts in India have
cautioned that, being a wide departure from English law, the
Section alone should be enforced according to its terms and not
in accordance with English law.  Thus, in New Standard Bank,
Ltd. v.  Probodh Chandra Chakravarty , AIR 1942 Cal 87 at
90-91, the Calcutta High Court held:-
“By  s.  63,  Contract  Act,  every  promisor  may
dispense  with  or  remit  wholly  or  in  part  the
performance of the promise made to him or may
accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks
fit. This section makes a wide departure from the
English law, inasmuch as it does not refer to any
agreement and valuable consideration. It should not
therefore, be enlarged by any implication of English
doctrine: Chunna  Mal  Ram  Nath  v. Mool  Chand-
Ram Bhagat [(1928) I.L.R. 9 Lah. 510 (518) : L.R.
55 I.A. 154 (160)].”
45.To similar effect is a judgment of the Bombay High Court
reported  as  Anandram  Mangturam  v.  Bholaram  Tanumal ,
AIR 1946 Bom 1 at 6, in which Chagla, J. stated:-
“But the learned Judge expresses his opinion that
time can be extended even though the promisee
may not bind himself to do so. With great respect to
the learned Judge, I cannot accept that part of the
statement of the law. The learned Judge’s judgment
57is  based  on  English  decisions  to  which  he  has
referred  in  his  judgment.  The  Privy  Council  has
repeatedly  warned  Courts  in  India  not  to  import
doctrines of common law when construing the plain
sections  of  the  Contract  Act  and  the  danger  of
relying  on  principles  of  Common  Law  is  all  the
greater in this case when one remembers that s. 63,
Contract Act constitutes a wide departure from the
principles of the English common law.”
46.Even if the passage in Halsbury is to be applied, it is
obvious that the settlement terms spoken of must be made for
good consideration, which is absent under Section 63.  Also, for
such  settlement  to  constitute  a  new  and  independent
agreement,  it  must  put  an  end  to  the  proceeding  which  is
thereby spent and exhausted; and it is for this reason that the
original cause of action is superseded altogether.  We have
seen on the facts of the present case how, by the order dated
25.1.2000,  the  application  in  Suit  No.1  of  2000  alone  was
dismissed  for  non-prosecution,  only  interim  orders  were
vacated and it was stated that “the vessel shall cease to be
under  arrest  as  of  now.”   It  is  clear,  therefore,  that  in
accordance  with  the  agreement  dated  18.1.2000,  the
proceedings were not put an end to. Neither was the original
58cause of action superseded, as we have stated earlier. The
moment there is a breach of the settlement agreement, the
appellants would be  entitled to take appropriate  legal  steps
against the ship owner, including the arrest of the vessel, which
can only be if the original contract still subsists. 
47.Mr. Banerjee laid great reliance on a judgment of the
Singapore High Court in  The Dilmun Fulmar , (2003) SGHC
270.  On the facts of that case, the ship repairers repaired the
vessel and supplied material to the vessel.  The ship owner
paid a sum of $650,000 for repairs, leaving an outstanding
balance  sum  of  $770,822.28  as  at  8.5.2001.  A subsequent
settlement  agreement  was  entered  into  in  which  the  ship
repairer agreed to accept a total sum of $310,000, inclusive of
$25,000 interest and $25,000 as legal costs in full and final
settlement of their claim in the admiralty suit, which was for a
sum of $1,154,916.78.  Paragraph 7 of the said judgment is
important and reads as under:
“7. The issue raised by this appeal touched on the
true  construction  and  effect  of  the  Settlement
Agreement.  In coming to my decision to set aside
the writ and warrant of arrest, I had to construe the
59accord.  Generally, an agreement of compromise
would  discharge  all  original  claims  and
counterclaims unless it expressly provides for their
revival  in  the  event  of  breach.   The  Settlement
Agreement was worded in such a way that there
was by its terms an immediate binding compromise
of the claim amount of $1,154,916.78.  By cl 1, the
plaintiff  agreed  to  accept  a  sum  of  $310,000
inclusive of interest and legal costs in full and final
settlement of a larger claim...”
48.From this paragraph, it is clear that the plaintiffs agreed to
accept a lesser sum in full and final settlement of a larger claim
and this was the amount stated in the settlement agreement.
Indeed, in paragraphs 11 and 13 of the judgment, it is stated:
“11…The plaintiffs’ solicitors in a fax dated 1 August
2002 wrote: “[T]he sum due is in fact S$170,000 as
stated in the Settlement Agreement together with
interest thereon up to 23rd January 2002 … ”  
“13…There  was  no  explanation  as  to  where  the
figure of $170,000 had come from if it was not from
the Settlement Agreement...”
49.On the facts of that case it was, therefore, held that the
original cause of  action had been superseded  and  that  the
Court had no jurisdiction in respect of the original claim. 
6050.This case is wholly distinguishable in that, on the facts of
the present case, the very sum due under the original contract
continued  to  be  due  and  payable  under  the  settlement
agreement.  The fact that interest and legal costs were added
would not amount in itself to superseding the original contract,
as these relate to payments under the original contract and put
the  promisee  in  the  same  position  as  if  the  contract  had
originally been performed.  We have also seen that the original
agreement  was  not  superseded  but  was  only  sought  to  be
enforced,  the  manner  of  performance  being  different.   This
being  the  case,  we  are  of  the  view  that  the  High  Court’s
conclusion that there was a novatio of the original agreement
on the facts of the present case is incorrect. 
51.It only remains to be considered as to whether, on the
date of arrest i.e. 2.5.2000, respondent no. 1 happened to be
the  owner  of  the  vessel,  as  was  found  by  the  impugned
judgment.
52.The High Court strongly relied upon an oral admission of
PW1 to the effect that respondent no.1 had become the owner
61of the vessel sometime in April 2000.  On going through the
deposition of Mr. Stephen Livanos, we are clearly of the view
that  no  such  admission  was  ever  made.   The  answers  to
questions 257 to 262 would clearly show that the witness’s
statement that respondent no.1 was the end buyer of the vessel
was  equivocal  at  best,  and  was  obviously  hearsay  as  the
answer to question 260 states that a lawyer in Greece had at
some point of time told Mr. Livanos what happened with the
vessel. To therefore conclude from this oral evidence that the
vessel had changed hands in April, 2000 does not take the
respondent’s case very far. 
53.However, the High Court also relied upon a notarized bill
of sale dated 14.4.2000,  the notice of readiness of 15.4.2000,
which was accepted by the respondent at 11.00 A.M, and was
followed by the delivery of possession of the vessel at 2.00 P.M.
What is important to note is that the signatory to the physical
delivery  certificate  was  on  behalf  of  Pennon  Shipping
Corporation,  which  was  only  an  agent  of  Third  Element
Enterprises, and not an agent of Fairsteel.  The High Court then
62went on to state that payment under the Letter of Credit was
also made on 26.4.2000 and since this would show that the
property in the vessel was transferred in April, 2000, no cause
of action would survive against the new owner of the vessel
namely respondent no.1.  The High Court also went on to state
that  the  transfers  pleaded  in  the  written  statement  of
respondent no. 1, namely from Third Element Enterprises to
Eastern Wealth Investment Limited and thereafter to Fairsteel
Corporation Limited after which Fairsteel sold and transferred
the  vessel  to  respondent  no.1,  had  not  been  proved  by
respondent no.1, but that this did not affect the respondent’s
case. 
54.We have been shown a bill of sale dated 27.4.2000 by
which Third Element Enterprises effected the first of these four
sales to Eastern Wealth Investment Limited, only on 27.4.2000.
This sale has for its consideration “one US Dollar and/or other
valuable consideration” casting grave doubts about its efficacy
in law. Be that as it may, since this sale is the first sale in the
chain of sales made ultimately to respondent no.1, it is obvious
63that the sale made by Fairsteel to respondent no.1 could only
have  been  after  this  date.   Shri  Banerjee  cited  before  us
authorities to the effect that it is well known that back to back
sales of this nature take place between different parties for the
same vessel. That may well be  so, but it is still necessary to
prove  and  explain  each  back  to  back  sale  from  which
respondent no.1 ultimately derives its title, in accordance with
its pleading in the written statement filed by it.  As has correctly
been held by the High Court, there is no proof of any of these
back to back sales, and in point of fact the very first sale from
the original owner has taken place in favour of Eastern Wealth
after the High Court has found that the vessel has been sold by
Fairsteel  to  respondent  no.1,  which  goes  contrary  to  the
pleaded case of respondent no.1 itself. We were also referred
to a document dated 26.4.2000 by which a new clause 8 was to
be added to the Letter of Credit which read as follows:-
“COPY  OF  FREE  OF  ENCUMBRANCES
CERTIFICATE  ISSUED  BY  EMBASSY  OF
REPUBLIC  OF  CYPRUS,  MARITIME  SECTION,
PIRAEUS,  CERTIFYING  THAT  THE  MOTOR
VESSEL  “NIKOLAS  S”  PERMANENTLY
REGISTERED  IN  THE  CYPRUS  REGISTER  OF
64SHIPS,  OWNED  BY  “THIRD  ELEMENT
ENTERPRISES SHIPPING LTD.” OF CYPRUS IS
FREE  OF  MORTGAGE  AND  ANY  OTHER
ENCUMBRANCES.”
Further,  as  per  clause  no.8  we  confirm  that  the
Buyers  have  received  the  Notice  of  Readiness
(NOR)  on  15.04.2000  from  the  Sellers  or  their
Agents in Calcutta and authorize you to negotiate
the L/C as per the terms.”
This  clause  would  again  go  to  show  that  even  on
26.4.2000  the  owner  of  the  vessel  was  Third  Element
Enterprises and not respondent no.1.
55.With regard to the High Court finding that full payment
had been made under the Letter of Credit on 26.4.2000, the
respondent’s own suit that was filed by it against Fairsteel on
9.5.2000 shows that no such payment had been made by the
date of the filing of the said suit.  The suit was for the relief of
rescission of the agreement between Fairsteel and respondent
no.1 dated 21.1.2000 on the ground of fraud.  Para 27 of the
suit is important and states as follows:-
“27.In  the  facts  and  circumstances  aforestated,
the  defendant  no.1  has  fraudulently  induced  the
plaintiff  to  issue/open  the  said  L/C  through  the
defendant no.2 in favour of the defendant no.1.  The
defendant no.1 is not entitled to receive and should
65be restrained from receiving any payment under the
said  L/C  and  the  plaintiff  claims  a  decree  of
perpetual injunction in that regard.”
56.The relief claimed in the other suit is also important and
prayers “C” and “D” are material and read as under:-
“(c)Decree of perpetual injunction restraining the
defendant no.1 whether by itself or through its
servants or agents from receiving any money
under  the  Letter  of  Credit  No.CAL/24006
dated 8th April 2000, issued by the defendant
no.2 in favour of the defendant no.1.
(d)Decree of perpetual injunction restraining the
defendant  no.2  from  making  any  payment
under  the  Letter  of  Credit  No.CAL/24006
dated  8th April  2000  issued/opened  by  it  in
favour of the defendant no.1.”
57.This  would  show,  on  the  respondent’s  own  admission
made in the plaint dated 9.5.2000, that monies were not yet
received under the Letter of Credit even on 9.5.2000 and that,
therefore, an injunction should be granted restraining defendant
no.1 from receiving this money and against the Bank of Baroda
– plaintiff’s bank – from making any such payment to defendant
no.1.  Thus, it is clear that the High Court was not correct in its
view that it was proved by respondent no.1 that sale had taken
66place in April, 2000 by Fairsteel Corporation to respondent no.1
by which respondent no.1 became the owner of the vessel.  It is
clear, therefore, that respondent no. 1 has failed to prove that
there was a change of ownership of the vessel in its favour on
the date of arrest i.e. on 2.5.2000.  This being the case, we set
aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the decree of
the trial court which reads as under:-
“In the result, the suit succeeds.  There would be a
decree  as  against  the  vessel  M.V.  Nikolaos-S  of
US$  94,611.25  equivalent  to  Rs.42,57,500.00  in
Indian currency. The plaintiff would be entitled to
recover  the  said  sum  from  the  cash  security
furnished to the Registrar, High Court, Original Side
together  with  accrued  interest  thereon.  The
Registrar,  Original  Side,  High  Court,  however,  is
entitled to deduct necessary commission applicable
thereto.”   
58.The appeal is, accordingly, allowed in the aforesaid terms.
